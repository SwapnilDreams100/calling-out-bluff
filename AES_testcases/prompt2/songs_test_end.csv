"Certain materials being removed from libraries such as books, music and magazines, shouldn't be removed from the libraries. It gives people a chance to understand how the real world @CAPS2.     Having certain materials such as books and music definitly should not be removed, because most books and music can show most people how bad the statement in the book @CAPS2 or how bad the lyrics are in a song, and help that person to avoid that type of thing that the book or song @CAPS2 saying to the reader or listener. People should give every type of music at least a try and not always doubt what they hear about what people say about that type of music. I always hear about people saying how bad the band @PERSON1 A.M. @CAPS2, just because in the lyrics it talks about drugs and how much cursing each song has. Really the band @CAPS2 talking about one mans life and how he turns his life from being a drug addict to having the best life someone could ever live. People always doubted him and never gave his music a chance. Another example would be @PERSON1's book, '@CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4' for it talks about drug addicts, homeless people, people who have been born with disfigured arms or even someone who lost there legs, and telling how beautiful each and everyone of them really are. His book taught me a few things and made me think different about people. It doesn't matter how they look or how they talk, no matter what, that person @CAPS2 beautiful.     As far as movies and magazines has gone within the last few years, I think that the also shouldn't be taken from libraries. I think @CAPS1 for the same reason of how I feel about the books and music. Of course we see previews of movies and think that they @MONTH1 not be good, but libraries shouldn't keep leave them out. Movies @CAPS2 a great way to learn how to treat others and how to act around other people when you don't know how to act. If you act differently around people that you've never been around before, then you could feel embarassed or maybe even get @CAPS4. Movies can help people learn about the real world by seeing how to do those type of things as we get older. Same goes with the magazines, they also help people see what not to do or to help them understand the consequences of something that shouldn't be done. Knowing what to do from a magazine could possible save your life or perhaps maybe even someone elses life.     I don't understand why some libraries would want to banned certain materials to help people understand the things that happen in someone elses life and to help them not make the same mistakes as that person once did..Chorus:   Oh no, I'm not the one you see   So don't you go confusing me   I've got a different mentality   I'm trying to be drama free   You stress me out and that's the truth   I don't want no substitute   For the peace of my mind that comes to me   Cause I'm living drama free   Can you give me one bit of rest?.Just how it got this way, and how it got so bad..I'll stand with arms high and heart abandoned   In awe of the one who gave it all   I'll stand, my soul Lord to You surrender   All I am is Yours   I'll stand with arms high and heart abandoned   In awe of the one who gave it all   I'll stand, my soul Lord to You surrendered   All I am is Yours   I'll stand with arms high and heart abandoned   In awe of the one who gave it all   I'll stand, my soul, Lord, to You surrendered   All I am is Yours   I'll stand with arms high and heart abandoned   In awe of the one who gave it all   I'll stand, my soul, Lord, to You surrendered   All I am is Yours   I'll stand with arms high and heart abandoned   In awe of the one who gave it all   I'll stand, my soul, Lord, to You surrendered   All I am, all I am is Yours   I'll stand, I'll stand with arms high and heart abandoned   In awe of the one who gave it all   I'll stand, my soul, Lord, to You surrendered   All I am is Yours.It's not the spotlight, it's not the cam'ra light,   It's not the street lights of some old street of dreams..I'll even wear long underwear, when winter breezes blow   I'm gonna take good care of me because, a sneeze or two might mean the flu,   And that would never never do      What if I can't live to love you as long as I want to....Could it be that he's interested   Or am I just wanting it be so   Do I dare speak to him   Or should I let the moment go      Forget this hunger inside   Forget this hunger inside   Should I let the feelin' flow   Should I just let it flow   Ain't nothin' but a maybe ?..It breaks my heart to awaken..Step on the gas   ... Nigga ain't got no gas   Step on the gas, step on the gas,   If you say he won't say put the best for less   Step on the gas..I've been waiting so long.So here we are tonight,   You and me together   The storm outside, the fire is bright   And in your eyes I see   What's on my mind   You've got me wild   Turned around inside   And then desire, see, is creeping   Up heavy inside here   And know you feel the same way   I do now      Now let's make this an evening   Lovers for a night, lovers for tonight   Stay here with me, love, tonight   Just for an evening   When we make   Our passion pictures   You and me twist up   Secret creatures   And we'll stay here   Tomorrow go back to being friends      Go back to being friends   But tonight let's be lovers,   We kiss and sweat   We'll turn this better thing   To the best   Of all we can offer, Just a rogue kiss   Tangled tongues and lips,   See me this way   I'm turning and turning for you   Girl, just tonight      Float away here with me   An evening just wait and see   But tomorrow go back to your man   I'm back to my world   And we're back to being friends   Wait and see me,   Tonight let's do this thing   All we are is wasting hours until the sun comes up it's all ours   On our way here   Tomorrow go back to being friends      Go back to being friends   Tonight let's be lovers, say you will   And hear me call, soft-spoken whispering love   A thing or two I have to say here   Tonight let's go all the way then   Love I'll see you,   Just for this evening   Let's strip down, trip out at this   One evening starts with a kiss   Run away      And tomorrow   Back to being friends   Lovers, love, lovers   Just for tonight, one night, love you   And tomorrow say goodbye.There she stood in the doorway,   I heard the

"In @DATE1's world, there are many things found offensive.  Everyone has their own opinion on what is offensive and what is not. Many parents are becoming upset because they think their children are viewing things that they should not.  Other people are upset because they think the libraries are offending their culture or way of life.  This is even taken to the extreme where people want censhorship on libraries to avoid this, which is wrong.     Some people are becoming concerned about the materials in libraries.  They find these things to be offensive.  Everyone is entitled to their own opinion, but there really is nothing anyone can do if someone is offended.  The world is a public place and everywhere we go, something might be found offensive.  The library is a place for study.  It is never intended to offend someone, or bring bad to the world.  It is simply a place to inform, and if someone is offended by what they see, they should stay away from the library.     I have been to the library many times, none of which have I ever seen anything offensive.  Everything I have ever witnessed at the library is for learning and research.  There are certain sections in the library.  If a parent does not want their child seeing something, they should keep their child in the children's section.  I can assure you, there is nothing offensive in the children's section, or else the library would not have it in that section.  The owners of these libraries know what is going to upset people and what will not.  If there was truly offensive materials in the library, those materials would be taken out.     Also, if a person complains, and the materials are removed, it could lessen someone else's chance getting the materials they need.  One person could think the material is offensive, but someone else might want to learn more about it.  If one is offended by a certain material, all they simply must do, is not look at it.  The library can be compared to a big computer.  One can basically find anything there.  Asking the library to censor their materials is like asking the internet to censor theirs.  It is a way of learning and researching and it would be almost impossible to censor everything there.     Everyone is going to be offended some point in their life.  If the libraries removed everything that could offend someone, they would have no materials left.  People need to stop being so easily offended and realize the library is not trying to harm anyone.  There does not need to be any censorship in libraries.  It is simply trying to teach people about the world and let them enjoy books, music, movies, or whatever else one might go to the library to find..Don't let the Joneses   Don't let the Jones   Don't let the Joneses   Get you down, oh down..Six months later she steamed up the van,   We got no small surprise..Lonely, lost every part of me   Maybe, outstayed my company   Walking in to sad scenes   Hold me tight and say goodbye   I've seen, behind tomorrow's sky   You be, my missing alibi   Bone me over backwards   Turn around and change my mind   Cause I've been thinking   About our world tonight   Slowly sinking into my appetite   Tomorrow morning   Are you a friend of mine   I swear, you've left me open   Nowhere, to hide this moment   Overcrowded daydreams   We're lost or so it seems   Cause I've been thinking   About our world tonight   Slowly sinking into my appetite   Tomorrow morning   Are you a friend of mine   Cause I've been thinking   About our world tonight   Slowly sinking into my appetite   Tomorrow morning   Are you a friend of mine.Tell me how do you expect me to   Say goodbye to you?.Some expert had uttered the word:      VOODOO      Keep your.Now blue ain't the word for the way that I feel   And a storm is brewing in this heart of mine   This ain't no crazy dream I know that's it real   You're someone else's love now, you're not mine      Crazy arms that reach to hold somebody new   But my yearning heart keeps saying you're not mine   My troubled mind knows soon to another you'll be wed   That's why I'm lonely all the time      Please take these treasured dreams I had for you and me   And take all the love I thought was mine   Someday my crazy arms will hold somebody new   But right now I'm so lonesome I could die      Crazy arms that reach to hold somebody new   But my yearning heart keeps saying you're not mine   My troubled mind knows soon to another you'll be wed   You're someone else's love now, you're not mine   Well you're someone else's love now, you're not mine.Have yourself a Merry little Christmas   Let your heart be light   From now on our troubles will be out of sight      Have yourself a Merry little Christmas   Make the yuletide gay   From now on our troubles will be miles away      Once again as in olden days   Happy golden days of yore   Faithful friends who are dear to us will be near to us once more      Through the years we all will be together   If the fates allow   Hanging a shining star upon the highest bough   And have yourself a Merry little Christmas now.So both of us are mad for      Nothin'   (Fighting for)..hey (oh yeah)   Hey I love you so near, I love you so far   I gotta tell you baby you're driving me ga ga      Tear 'em up - tear it off   Yeah let's go   Wooh, what are you doin' to me ?.Somebody hear me, somebody listen to me   Am I alone in this world   Is there anyone listening?.What do I do now?.I bid it to return   To hear your wonderous stories..Who you gonna throw in the lake of fire,   O God our Lord, O God our Lord..I waited patiently, but I found it hard to see,      If you were coming, why was there such a long delay..Comes out of the caves once a day to be fed   He wasn't known to say much   But, ""Thanks for the bread."".[Chorus]      It's gonna be fine   It's gonna be fine, just fine   Just hold out your heart my darling   Just hold out your heart my darling   Hold out your heart   And I will give you all of mine.No   When you see somebody who's down and out   Lend a helpin' hand      You better, lend a helpin' hand..Let me lock in the system at Warp 2   Push it on into systematic overdrive, you know what to do      Let's cruise past all the golden poo   That makes me blue   This thing gonna ?.I'll cling on steadfastly...

"The idea of the removal of 'offensive' material from libraries is understandable. Some believe that this material is not appropriate for anyone to view. However, because we all have different opinions on what is offensive, I believe that books found to be offensive should not be removed from the shelves of the library.      First, I believe that if this policy were to be in effect in libraries, there would not be many books left on the shelf. Offensive is a relative word. What @MONTH1 be offensive to one person @MONTH1 not be to another. Every has a different opinion on different matters based on their beliefs and life experiences. Many books have things people disagree with, but expressing this is a part of freedom of speech. Therefore, if everyone complained that they found a certain book or movie to be offensive, there would hardly be anything left, as Katherine Paterson said.      The purpose of a library is to provide the people who go to the library a resource. If the sources were censored in such a way, it would be hard to get information. Sometimes, it is beneficial, even, to read an opposing view or side to have more knowledge on a certain topic and see things from a different perspective.      However, some books @MONTH1 not be entirely appropriate to certain people. For example, some material in the library @MONTH1 not be best for small children to read or view. In this case, I do not necessarily feel that they should be removed from the shelves rather than placed in an area these children do not have access to.     Having books, music, movies, or magazines removed from the shelves if they are found to be offensive is in my opinion, a ridiculous notion. It hinders expression. People have different opinions about what is offensive to them and it would be very boring if everyone thought the same. If someone finds something particularly offensive, I believe they just should not view it.She no wait but she know me   Intake purge It's my disease      Hold me closer let me be   Hold me closer let

"I absolutely do not think that any book, movie, magazine, music, etc., should be removed from the shelf because they find it offensive.  If we do that, then all the books would be off the shelf.  Sometimes the really good books are when they are offensive, because they are actually telling you what they really believe in.     I remember when I was twelve, the news was saying that a school was taking books off the shelf because it offended one person in the school.  The shocking part was that almost the whole school was reading that book.  Even teachers were reading it.  The school board did not even care though.  I think that was completely handled the wrong way.  They should have talked to the girl and said it was unfair to ask that when everybody reads it.  If it offended her, then she should not read it.     Music is an outlet for many people.  They can express their feelings in a way that is amazing.  Without music, there would not be any fun in the world.  People are alwasy listening to music.  When they are sad, mad, upset, confused, etc.  If people think some kind of music is offensive, then they should not listen to it.     Movies are going to be offensive to at least one thing all the time.  That is what makes a movie: a hero and a vilian.  We want to good guys to win.  The movie makes fun of the bad guys.  Somebody is always going to get hurt.     When I read, watch, or listen to something, I do not think of how offensive it is to me or somebody else.  I think of how the artist feels.  Why they wrote it that certain way.  If I am listening to music, I listen to the beat and the words at first.  Then if I like it, I start singing it.  If I do not like it, then I just change the song.     I hope people do not end up just taking things off the shelf when someone is offended.  We need the different opinions in life.  If we all had the same opinions, we would not be ourselves in anyway.  I do not want to be the same as everybody else.  I love my personality.  I am different and kind of an outcast.  But I am true to myself.  And I respect other people's opinions.  I wish everyone would do the same.  Or at least try to do the same.

"Should certain materials be removed from the shelves of the library that are found offensive? @PERSON1 states that we will have no books left of the shelf to read if everyone removes a book they do not approve of. What some people think is the most innocent book, could offend another individual. Different people find different topics offensive. No two people think the same.     Though certain books or magazines @MONTH1 have offensive subjects or materials in them, if they were to be removed, how would we learn? For example, say there was a historical fiction book about racism. The book might show different perspectives of how people lived when racism flourished. Readers could learn from the books how racism affects people, and why it is wrong. Learning about dislikes can make someone more knowledgable on why some people think the way they do. The readers can learn from mistakes made in the past. Books or movies depict how life was years or even centuries ago; morals were different a while ago from what they are now.     If many people were to agree that a certain material is very offensive or not appropriate for adolescents or young children, one option that could be available is only allowing adults to check it out. The library could also put a warning on it if they think the content of the material is too harsh. Another idea could be setting up reviews on a website with a list of each book in the library. Consumers can read the review first and then decide whether to check it out or not.     People have their own opinions and views on materials. A person should learn to be tolerant of materials; others might truely enjoy it. This article might be offensive to those who read it, because they might think things should be more sensored rather than tolerated.  If someone does not like the material, they are not forced to check it out of the library so why cause a fuss over it? One person might find a topic very offensive while that same topic sparks interest in another individual. Each person has different morals so who is to say what should and should not be in a library?.Babe I'm leaving   I must be on my way   The time is drawing near   My train is going   I see it in your eyes   The love, the need, your tears   But I'll be lonely without you   And I'll need your love to see me through   So please believe me   My heart is in your hands   And I'll be missing you      'Cause you know it's you babe   Whenever I get weary   And I've had enough   Feel like giving up   You know it's you babe   Giving me the courage   And the strength I need   Please believe that it's true   Babe, I love you      You know it's you babe   Whenever I get weary   And I've had enough   Feel like giving up   You know it's you babe   Giving me the courage   And the strength I need   Please believe that it's true   Babe, I love you      Babe, I'm leaving   I'll say it once again   And somehow try to smile   I know the feeling we're trying to forget   If only for a while   'Cause I'll be lonely without you   And I'll need your love to see me through   Please believe me   My heart is in your hands   'Cause I'll be missing you   Babe, I love you   Babe, I love you   Ooh, babe.I never made it back to Boston   I've always been a rambling man   But by the time I got to Phoenix   She didn't quite fit in my plans   I lost my heart in San Francisco   And found it in the streets of Baltimore   There must be someone wanting true love   Could it be you?.(Hustle, man)      Ask About me   Ask About me.We are only wanting freedom   We are only wanting freedom   We are only wanting freedom   We are only wanting freedom (""Freedom, freedom, freedom, freedom..."")

"Writing is a way to express one's thoughts and ideas on a page. In this country, an author can write freely about whatever he desires and he is not subject to penalty for doing so. Sometimes reading these works can be enjoyable, other times it can be rather disturbing. However, just because a work is offensive does not mean that it is not worth reading. Books, manuscripts, and other forms of literature should not be taken off the shelves even if they are disturbing or offensive.      The @CAPS1, a book written by @PERSON2, revealed the horrible practices of the meat packing industry. It was offensive to many, and in addition it caused an uprising among @CAPS2 because of its content. However, there is a reason that book is still talked about today. If there had been laws prohibiting him from writing about the horrific things that were taking place in those factories, it is quite possible and actually very likely that the industry wouldn't have been reformed for a long time. Fortunately, @PERSON2 exposed the horrific processes that took place in the industry and the government stepped in and solved the problem. Someone out there hates this book, and hated it from the day it was published. But that doesn't mean he has the right to remove it from the shelves and prevent all others from reading it.     Too often students are forced to read works of fiction and stories that, although they are beneficial for students, do not inform students about the world in which they find themselves. It is important for a student to read @ORGANIZATION1, and the works @PERSON4 and @LOCATION1. However, students must learn and begin to understand the world in which they currently find themselves, the eras of the past, and the circumstances that they will find themselves in for decades to come. They must learn how to become successful in life. They should read works by @PERSON1, such as @CAPS3, which essentially tells the story of success and what seperates the average from the great. Someone out there hates these works, and he should not have the right to ruin the opportunity that these books and short stories could give someone else.     Reading is the best way to learn. In a world of social networking and 'screens' of all types, the importance of reading has been diminished. Students must develop a love of reading, and if everyone who hates a book takes it off the shelves, then, as Paterson said, 'we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' No book should ever be taken off the shelves.

"Dear Newspaper,      I beleive that no book should be taken off the selfs for nay reason. People @MONTH1 not be mature enough for some books, music, magazines, etc., and so the libraries that have a problem with some of the materials then maybe they should put a limit to age on checking out certain things. Libraires keep all types of books and magazines so what would be their reason to take the material off the self? I think that there are different types of people in the world and everyones going to wnat to read something different.        If libraries are going to take the material off the self that people don't like then the material that others like would be gone. For instance,if i were to take the '@CAPS1' series off the selves then all the '@CAPS1' fans would be ferious and upset. But knowing that lots of people like the series, my library isn't going to do that. There is alot of books that parents don't want their children to read, but libraries arn't going to take them off the selfs.     Some parents arn't going to want their children and teenagers to read a romantic, rasy book but thats what other adults enjoy reading. Those books arn't going to go away but if parents have problems with it then maybe they should mention to the library to put an age limit to them. The parents could also check on what their child or teenager is reading. But those books will be in libraries forever and you can't make them go away because you don't want you're chilren to read them.     From experiance, I've read a couple racy books and they are disturbing for me, being an imatture addiunce. But i'm not going to ask for the books to be taken off the self. Some books are very vulger and nasty in the ways they discribe fights or wars or abuse but some people like readinf lititure like that so the libraries will keep them. If peoplehave problems with books then stay away from them and don't read them. Its as simple as that.      In conclusion, I think all books should stay on the shelves because all people have different interest and opinions. If anyone has a problem with a book for being racy or vulgur then they shouldn't ready that book, and if they dont want their childrena and teenagers to read the book either then they should be a parent and not let them. They can't blame the library for books they don't want their kids to read because thats not fair to the people who enjoy those books and like to read them.

"I belive certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should never be removed from libraries because even if offensive people still have the right to acess that information. I make this opinion by the guidlines our country was built on, freedom of speech and equality for everyone. If we started removing books, movies etc. from out of our libraries for being offensive, where would we draw the line between offensive and not? To remove even one book from a library for offending a certain race or culture, would be the beging of a tornado of books being removed by eveyone who has ever not agreed with what is said about them or about their culture and lifestyles. Now, let's stop and think about what it means for somthing to be offensive in the first place. People are offended by things in out world every day and books and movies in our libraries are probably pretty low down on the offensive totem pole next to say the internet or news I would think, wouldn't you?. Plus, the materials we provide to our libraries with are for people too learn and teach, they arn't made to be offensive or rude and in my experience with libraries being a @NUM1+ year user I have never found anything to be offesive or hurtful to anyone.In my conclusion there are just too many books about to many subjects already written to even begin to go through which ones are offensive or not and too whom. In conclusion to that libraries are a place of leaning and teaching and the information inside is ment to be helpful and constructive not offesive or hurtful and to start removing materials now would eventualy lead to the end of libraries..In love with the dance floor,   Cause he really touch me on!.Take me there..Time to go...

"Have you ever been offended? Did you lash out, or did you keep an open mind and come try understanding? People are offended by many things every day in life. So, we should broaden our minds, and see these 'offenses' as a normality.     You're at a party with a bowl full of candy stationed right beside the front door. You walk in and take a piece. Wait, you don't want that piece? What are you going to do with it? Do you take all of the same pieces that you don't like out of the bowl and throw them away, or do you simply drop it back into the bowl and choose a new one? If you throw the candy away, what does that mean for the other party guests? You have narrowed their choices down because of your own selfish opinion. That candy could have been the guest favorite. But, since YOU don't like it, you take away the other guests' privilege to eat that candy. They didn't deserve that, now did they?     If you're searching through books in a library and you come across a book that doesn't interest you or offends you, then put it back and look for a new one. If you're having trouble finding the right book, ask the librarian for suggestions on other topics or books to check out. Go to a new library, even, but don't mess with something that isn't yours. Especially, something as small as a book.     The point of the matter is, if you don't like something then disregard it. The moment the book, and the book alone, starts causing problems is the moment anyone should intervene. But, come on, do you really think a book could cause a problem? If your child is having problems, don't you think you ought to check what's going on with him instead of looking to see if he/she checked out the 'book that we hope none of our children' took off the shelf. This is quite possibly one of the last things I would think of causing a problem, if I even thought of this at all. Opinions can cause a lot of problems. Sometimes, people just need to keep their opinions to themselves, agreed?.Trust, I knew what it was..All alone, lost in my dreams   Who could know, just how I feel   All the hopes and fears, the joy,   The tears hidden in my heart   Tell me I'm not dreaming, is it you?.You came to our side..Suckers are trying to step off on my tip   We got our own ideas!.Like a desert needs rain   Like a town needs a name   I need your love      Like a drifter needs a room   Hawkmoon   I need your love   I need your love      Like a rhythm unbroken   Like drums in the night   Like sweet soul music   Like sunlight   I need your love      Like coming home   And you don't know where you've been   Like black coffee   Like nicotine   I need your love (I need your love)   I need your love (I need your love)   I need your love (I need your love)      When the night has no end   And the day yet to begin   As the room spins around   I need your love   I need your love      Like a Phoenix rising needs a holy tree   Like the sweet revenge of a bitter enemy   I need your love      Like the hot needs the sun   Like honey on her tongue   Like the muzzle of a gun   Like oxygen   I need your love (I need your love)   I need your love (I need your love)   I need your love (I need your love)      When the night has no end   And the day yet to begin   As the room spins around   I need your love      I need your love...

"Every library has tons of information on just about everything.  There are tons of books, music, movies, magazines and more that contain this information.  There is even some information that some people might take offence to.  On the other hand, somebody else could be perfectly fine with it.  I think that all libraries should keep all their books on the shelfs, no matter what kind of content they contain, because not everybody takes offence to some contents in books, and it is the same way vice versa.     The subject race might come into play in some books in libraries.  Books have information about people doing things to other people just because of their race.  Some people want books took out of their libraries because of the content that they contain, but really it could be a n important part of history that people need to be educated about.  Some books have words that are very offencive to people because of their skin color, relgion, or ethnic race.  This information that people need to know because thats how people were treated back then and some stuff like that still occurs today.     Libraries have all kinds of information.  I think that all the books at libraries should stay there no matter what they contain.  Even if some content is offensive some people it could still be a important part of history that people need to know.I know you've been in love before   I know it some times seems like war   But I

"Author Katherine Paterson once said, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf.  But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf--that work I abhor--then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else.  And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.'  @CAPS1 quote is reflecting people wanting to rid of some of the literature, books, magazines, music, and movies in libraries, because they think that the material is inappropriate.  If we got rid of all of the books from @CAPS1 world, we would have nothing left to learn from, and some of the main sources of entertainment would vanish. I believe that certain materials should not be replaced from the shelves, because the youth of today need to learn about the true past, people should learn about how cultures really are, authors and writers need to be able to express themselves, and parents should be able to control what they believe their children should and should not read.       If it were not for books and novels from the past, the current generations would have no clue of what history was about.  Children should be allowed to read books such as @ORGANIZATION1, The @CAPS2 @CAPS3, and @CAPS4 @CAPS5 in order to get a taste of how much times have changed.  Stories from grandparents only take a person back about @NUM1 years; we need sources that can take us back thousands of years.  Some families, such as an @CAPS6 @CAPS7 family, might get offended if their children are reading books that say things like 'nigger,' but that is our history.  It is something we cannot change, and it is important for kids to know how things really were and how terrible people were treated.  We also do not want today's youth making some of the terrible mistakes generations in the past made, so they need to be taught about the real but sometimes horrendous situations.     Learning about different cultures would be another issue if books and movies were depleted.  Money is not available these days to just travel to different countries and experience their culture.  How is a young girl from a small town in @LOCATION2 supposed to find out how people in @LOCATION1 live their life?  For all she knows, the people could be living in igloos.  I believe that it is important for people to understand different cultures and religions in order to accept them in society.  Movies can teach a lot about different countries, and books do a wonderful job as well.  If they are gone, cultures would be misunderstood and forgotten.     Also, authors and directors need to be able to express themselves.  Every since people are young, they are taught that it is important to be unique and express their own style.  Not every writer is going to want to write about butterflies and rainbows.  There are people that love writing about violence, gore, and segregation.  Those things are part of the world today and everyone needs to face that reality.  Getting rid of all of those books from library shelves will not solve the problems; it would only cause people to not expect what might happen to them or @CAPS1 world.       Now, some parents @MONTH1 have hard times when their young boy comes home from school with an offensive book, but parents should have control over their kids.  If they have a problem with what their children are reading, then they should deal with that personally.  They do not need to influence other people's lives by trying to get rid of the materials off of public libraries' shelves.     Why people would even consider getting rid of history and learning materials about cultures and different subjects in @CAPS1 world is beyond me.  It would be like asking someone to rewind time so that we would not have had slavery, depressions, world wars, and homicides.  It is impossible to undo history, but we can learn about the things from the past in order to not make the same mistakes and things of the current world in order to be accepting and understanding.  Books, magazines, movies, and music are wonderful.  They represent self-expression and freedom of speech, so people should let them be an entertainment and learning source.  Without them, we would be and have nothing.It ain't so much when a man's gotta cry   To get a little loving, and some peace of mind..I love you, for more than words can ever say..(You and me, sitting in a tree..Will you remember me baby?.So I'll end this shit wit a ""FUCK you, but have a nice day!"".I'm sick and I'm little tired..I ain't got nobody since she left me..Jolene smoothed her dark hair in the mirror..Ever since he was a little lad,   Loves the rodeo..Royal rebels discover you..Yeah..Snow in springtime, storm in the sea   Mist at my window, no leaf on my tree   Showers in the garden with no flowers to touch   When will you bring us your sunshine and such..Try just once to let your guard down, you've got nothin' there to hide      [Chorus]      Spill your heart out to me, darlin', girl I really need to know      [Chorus: x2]      ""Whatever we uncover, there'll be screams and whispers tonight""      Alright.Stick it, I'm tired I'm bored, I'm trying so hard and I can't be adored..get off of me!"".Ah, right!.I mean she ok, but she ain't all dat   She ain't the next bitch, tell that bitch fall back!.O Virgo splendens hic in monte celso   Miraculis serrato fulgentibus ubique..Lambo-o-oh   Lambo-o-oh   Your Daddy's Lambo?.It always seemed they got caught between the mob and the men in blue..Long live the night we spent together   Long live the night forevermore..Nanana hey!"
"Who cares about unsensored things anyway? Offensive things have been around in libraries, probably since the first library opened. There has been 'offensive' things in a library for as long as i can remember. Now everyone is suppose to share there opinons on pulling these offensive books off the shelve?     What is the differnce between someone saying somthing offense or writing it? Ok, so maybe you dont want your child reading somthing unsensored, but the chances are some other child will say somthing unsensored around him. If there is a book that is so bad you wouldnt want your kids reading, why would it of been published? Publishers do read the books they publish them, they will not publish any random thing. I think that they just need to leave the unsensored things alone. If you cant be mature enough to take a article, book, or magizine seriously, then you dont need to be reading it anyway.                                         In the news or radio you always hear about some boy getting bullied and stuff at school. That isnt because of unsensored things, why dont they blame it on parents and ask where they were at? Parents look at anyone and everyone, but themselves when a kid comes home and has learned a cuss word or somthing. It is never the parents fault.                                             If people pull unsensored things out of the library it will serve no purpose and thats just my opinion. I know that i have no say in it and thats ok i can still believe that i am right.

"Books that are offensive should not be taken off the shelf all together, but should be put in a section made for adult readers only.  This way no children would see the book anyway.       If an offensive book is in a school or any other place that the readers are children for the majority than it should be ok to take that book off of the shelf.     All together it should be ok to remove an offensive book from a shelf but only if the book is offencive to the wrong audience..I don't know..Will we you have what you require   To make your days on

"This is what's wrong with today's society. We are too soft.We're too worried about what other people might think if we say this or do that. I'm the kind of person that doesn't care about other peoples feelings. And I say that to an extent. If we're talking about my friends, family, my girlfriend, that's totally different. I show a lot of respect to those people on a daily basis. But as far as people I don't know, I could care less what their beliefs, opinions, and outlooks on life are. Maybe we should stop worrying about other people for once and just try to grow and prosper as a race.      Anybody ever think of that? If I had it my way, the @ORGANIZATION1 would not exist. @CAPS1, radio, books, movies, magazines would all be uncensored. Is life filtered and censored? Absolutely not! So why should those things be? I'm sick and tired of people constantly sheltering their children from lifes normalcies. They've gotta learn sometime. Life isn't lollipops and rainbows. It's hard, unforgiving, and it kicks you in the teeth. You've just got to learn to adapt to it. And censorship in libraries, on @CAPS1 etc, won't and aren't helping matters in the least bit. I guess I don't understand why we have to care so much. If everybody just relaxed a little and focused on themselves, we would be fine. Everytime I hear the word 'offensive' it makes me sick to my stomach, because in my eyes, that word doesn't exist. It's a made up word that really means we care about other peoples feelings more then we do our own.Don't ever let life pass you by..No ties that bind, no ball and chain,   The ghost is waiting outside..Come on   Light that ass on fire   Do you wanna get dirty, girl?.He said, ""Don't worry, baby..I look around and I see myself   I look around and I see myself   I'm piercing the skin      Chorus   I'm piercing the skin   One more time, I'm piercing the skin   Its going deeper through the skin   Going down, going down   Go...I can show you the world girl the world girl   But ain't nothing else like L.A..Black human trafficking or blood transfusion?.Tell me are you going through changes..Well you know every time I look at that expression printed on the page I think I hear you,   Whispering the magic and the compliments I need so badly   So baby come on, yeah, so baby come on   Now I've been running circles around the notion that you'd find me baby, One day maybe..Rapture   Rapture   Rapture.Have you had enough of me?.You're looking for a way out   I can feel it   Come on, show me where it hurts   Maybe I can heal it      Your feelings are your own   Now you keep 'em under lock and key   You got me drivin' through the streets   For an answer to the mystery      The world's still weak on Charleston Avenue   Outside that vacant Starlight Motel I see you   Laughing with your girlfriends   Not a care in the world, not a burden on your mind      It was a matter of time      There's a panic in this house and it's bound to surface   Just walkin' through the front door makes me nervous   It's creepin' up the floorboards, got me wondering where I stand   I cannot put out the fire, I got a book of matches in my hand      When we first met, headstrong and filled with doubt   Made just enough hustling tables that summer to take you out   I was fallin' back on forever when you told me about your heart   You laid it on the line      Laughing with your girlfriends   Not a care in the world, not a burden on your mind   (You laid it on the line)      It was just a matter, It was a matter of time      We found ourselves   We belong in it forever   Ain't that what it's all about?.you're gambling with your savings..Talkin' 'bout jooohhhnnny..The thought of you   Reaches inside,   Takes it away,   Conquers my pride..Yes I laugh in your face and I'm right..One day   We'll find the time   To spend, together   Until then, my love      If I had one wish   It wouldn't be hard to choose   Seven Sundays in a row   Cause that's the day   That I spend with you      Someday soon,   You and I   Will hold each other   Once again, my love      If I had one wish   It wouldn't be hard to choose   Seven Sundays in a row   Seven Sundays in a row   Seven Sundays in a row   Cause that's the day   That I spend with you      If I had one wish   It wouldn't be hard to choose.Both cut through the air with the pendulum's swing   In deadly but delicate fashion..Mildewed and smoldering, strangled by our coveting   I've done the math enough to know the dangers of our second guessing   Doomed to crumble unless we grow, and strengthen our communication..Adieu false heart, now we must part   May the joys of the world go with you   I love you long with a faithful heart   But never anymore can I believe you      I seen the time I'd married you   And been your constant lover   But now I'd gladly give you up   For one whose heart is truer      You think you are too good for me   You think I am forsaken   But if you think I care for you   You are very much mistaken      My mind is like the constant sun   From the east to the west it ranges   But yours is like unto the moon   It's every month, it changes      When I lay down to take my rest   No scornful one to wake me   I'll go straight way unto my grave   Just as fast as time can take me      Adieu false heart, now we must part   May the joys of the world go with you   I love you long with a faithful heart   But never anymore can I believe you.Something has changed within me   Something is not the same   I'm through with playing by the rules   Of someone else's game   Too late for second-guessing   Too late to go back to sleep   It's time to trust my instincts   Close my eyes and leap!.But, you live with decisions that you make in your life."
"Have you ever noticed how much bad materials are out there for childeren to get ahold of?  A movie, book, magazine, music, or even something on @CAPS1?  It would be nice to get rid of all that bad material, but what if someone else doesn't feel the same way about that song, movie, or @CAPS1 show?  I think it would be horrible if we took away all the bad materials because it might bring violence between some people who disagree on it, and it goes against one of our rights, freedom of speech.     In the world we live in today, if you take something away from someone like their favorite book, its going to bring out some violence between some people.  Look back into our history, we are a country full of rebels.  That is how @CAPS3 even came to be.  So take away something from people they are going to stand up and fight for it.  There will always be people trying to smuggle and hide some things, so we will never be able to get rid of it completly.       If you take away all the bad materials it would be taking away one of our rights, freedom of speech.  Some materials out there @MONTH1 be offensive to others, but it's not like we have a right to get rid it.  It's not like there is any book, magazine, or even a song out there that someone doesn't get offended by.  If we do take away all the offensive materials we should take away everything. So what is the point we all will never all agree on something, we can't please everyone.  In taking away all the offensive materials you are taking away people's right to freedom of speech.     Don't try to take away all the offensive materials, it will just bring violence and make it all much worse than it was.  If you're a parent it's not like you can shield your children from everything because eventually they will learn what it all is.  So it won't do any good to try to get rid of it.  It will still be around.  It is just something in our world that we have to live with.Songs cast alight on you..Rain or shine sleet or snow   You're the reason why I ain't goin' go   Cause I'm playing mine high and low   Ain't

"All throughout the world there are libraries.  Librairies have all different kinds of materiel stacked upon shelves.  Most of the material is helpful and enjoyable but some is not.  I think libraries should be able to have whatever they want on their shelves.  Yes, i understand some of this material @MONTH1 be inappropriate for a certain person but there is a way you can fix this.     If libraries have inappropriate books, movies, music, ect.  I think they should be able to keep them.  Just because some people do not that material does not mean everyone won't like it.  Everyone has their own style, everyone likes different things and has different opinions.  Isn't that what makes the world go around?       Adults @MONTH1 have a problem with the offensive material because they have children who go to the library.  I understand there concern but there can be a way to stop them from getting to the inappropriate material.  If libraries are going to have this kind of stuff in their libraries i think there should be a blocked off room where kids can't go.  That way the people who like that kind of stuff can still get to it but the children can not.       We go to school for a vast amount of reasons.  Some being; to learn, to get us ready for college, and to be independent.  While we are at school not only are we learing things like math and evolution, but we are also learing whats going on in the world around us.  If you haven't noticed, all that is out there anymore is bullying, cursing songs and horrifying movies.  We, as children and teenagers see and hear about this everyday.  Since we learn and already know about all of this 'offensive' stuff, why not have it in our libraries for other people who want to study it?     There is alot of different kinds of material in libraries.  Some good for kids and teenagers and some inappropriate.  I understand the concern for parents on censorship in public libraries, but there is a way to stop it.  I think as long as its blocked off into a different room, everyone will be fine and it will cause no harm.Deep down in Louisianna   Close to New Orleans   Way back up in the woods   Among the evergreens   There stand a country cabin   Made of clay and wood   Where lives a young country boy   Named Johnny B.

"Certain materials should not be removed from shelves if they are found offensive for three reason. The first reason being  what maybe offensive to you @MONTH1 not be to someone else. The next reason being that the thing being call offensive can help teach other. The last reason being if we all just removed thing we don't like the world wouldn't be the way it is.     The first reason is that what maybe offensive to you @MONTH1 not be to someone else. In this society we live in we shouldn't go base on ones option because everybody has a right to freedom of speech. History show that many different people found different thing to be offensive because some people think that book that haves gays shouldn't be in books, but many feel otherwise.That a good example on how people have different opition.     The next reason being that the thing being call offensive can help teach other about many different things. The libraries being a place to study and learn should have a bus load different things even if some take offensive to it. Infact some books teach us that we shouldn't get offfensive because that what one person feels and at long as your got someone who love you it doesn't matter.     The last reason being if we all just removed thing we don't like the world wouldn't be the way it is. Books are a way for someone to give there own point of veiw if you dislike it don't take offensive to it and try to removed it from the shelves. The @LOCATION1 has a government where they take everybodys opition. A prime example of this is the state funding schools which is a big issue we shouldn't just removed the school because someone doesn't like it.     In conclusion certain materials shouldn't be removed from shelves if they're found offensive for three reasons. The first reason being if you found something offensive it @MONTH1 not be to someone else. Next reason being that the thing being call offensive can help teach other about many different things. The last reason being if we all just removed thing we dislike the world wouldn't be the way it is..Southern girl, (yeah she a down South bitch)   That's all I need in my southern world, (yeah I'm on

Got to be certain   I've got to be so sure   I've had my share of hearts broken   And i don't want to take that any more      I've got some friends who say   Boys are all the same   They're only looking out for just one thing   I'm only hoping that   You won't turn out like that   I need some time 'til i can make up my mind      Been hurt in love before   But i still come back for more   I was such a fool   I couldn't stop myself   If you believe in me   If you want our love to be   I know you'll wait for me, oh, oh, oh, oh      [Chorus]      Oh, oh, oh, oh   Oh, oh, oh, oh      [Chorus until fade].Was it that long ago, you brought tears to my eyes?.Nobody, nobody, will ever love you   The way that I love you   Cause nobody's that strong   Love's bittersweet, life's treasures deep   No one can keep a love that's gone wrong      Nobody, nobody, gonna love you   The way I could   Cause nobody's that strong   No nobody's that strong      Nobody, nobody, is gonna love you   The way that I love you   Cause nobody is that strong      You've had many lovers,   You'll have many others   But they'll only just break   Your poor heart in two   And nobody, nobody, will love you   The way I could   Cause nobody's that strong,   No nobody's that strong.Tomorrow you won't be here, and I don't expect you to..It got me in the club, in the club,   Just rocking like this oh oh      The

"If you walk into a store and see a book you dont like or a magazine you could care less for, should you be able to get rid of it? My answer to that is no you should not. You do not own the libraries books and you do not have any say on what is displayed in any store. You are the viewers and buyers to these suppliers and if you dont like it dont buy it or look.     When I was in the eighth grade I went to @LOCATION2 for a church missions trip. There was alot of cool things there that I saw. This was one of the most popular places in the @LOCATION1. When we wouldn't be working or serving others we would walk around and do some shopping. There is alot of people in this city and it was packed all the time. Now with that being said there was alot of different stores and there are some in my opinion at the time that i thought were very inappropiate for my age level. My whole group walked into a store where we just really didnt belong and we all had no clue this was the kind of store this was. Our actions simply invovled nodding our heads good bye at the cashier and walking out continuing our day of shopping. We did not remove any books, pictures, or even magazines in that store. Reason being is that, that was their store and we had no right to remove anything. After we left there other people walked in that store and liked what they saw if we would have removed those items they wouldnt of got to see what they liked. That would be like someone removing something from a store I like meaning i'd never get to see it and I wouldn't want that.     If you walk in to a store and see something you do not like you shouldn't be able to try and get rid of that object. Whether you want your kids seeing it or not you just cant do it. You take your own risk walking into a store and seeing what they have in store for you.You are there to browse around or buy a few things if you would like too. Every store should have their own certain things and what you find offensive other people might like. That goes for the opposite too what other people find offensive you might like. It is all a big chain with many loops.      So say you do take that piece of material off that shelf or off the display. Now that material is gone all because of you thought it was offensive. Say another person walks in the ame store and takes something off the shelve that they thought was offensive. Now there is two things gone from the shelve, but you actually liked what they took off the shelve and your upset that they took that off. This will cause alot of conflict and big situations in the future if this was allowed. One person likes it one person doesnt. If you dont like what you see in a store then you shouldn't walk in or you should simply ignore the stuff that is offensive to you.     These are some of my opinions about this catagory. I believe you shouldn't be able to take stuff off shelves and terminate other stores products. Always be aware of what your getting your self into and know the outcome of the decisions you make. This could cause alot of lossed jobs and many conflicts between shoppers and viewers like you. I hope you take this into consideration and understand my reasonings for what I have said.Just another lesson learned   Wear a scar, a bore repeating   Take a simple fateful turn   Opened up to stop the bleeding      Feeling you never could   Been the disconnected frying   Hit the vein and struck a nerve   Seeing through a self that's blinding      Nowhere to buy in   Most of us hiding   Others are shining      You know when you find it   In your darkest hour, you strike gold   A thought clicks, not the be-all end-all   Just another lesson learned      Just another brick you toss   Stone the number one deceiver   Multiply the added cost   Easy to become a believer      Feeling like you never could   Been the disconnected frying   Hit the vein and struck a nerve   Seeing through a self that's blinding      Nowhere to buy in   Most of us hiding   Others are shining      You know when you find it   In your darkest hour, you strike gold   A thought clicks, not the be-all end-all      Just another lesson learned.Heaven in [?].If ya' want my love, baby please   You gotta give me all, the love you've got   If you want my love, oh   Gotta give me all the love you got   Oh yeah-eah, you know I like it like that   It's okay-yeah, you know I like it like that      Every Saturday night   When ya' wonder where I'm at   Every Saturday night   When ya' wonder where I'm at      Don't call me, all call you   I like it like that   When I'm feelin' sad and lonely, too   I like it like that   Yeah-hey-hey      If ya' need me baby   Just pick up that phone   Don't tell your friends about us   Just want to be alone   Don't tell your friends, baby   Just want to be alone      Yeah, I like it like that   Like it like that, that-that-that   Like it like that, oh like it like that   Like it like that, an' you know it, yeah      Like it like that, an' you know it, yeah-hey-hey   Like it like that, an' you know it, yeah   Like it like that, an' you know it      Like it like that, an' you know it   Like it like that, yeah.Oh, God, I don't know much about nothing..Well I double-crossed the woman who was two-timin' me   She gave me one good reason, yeah I gave her what for   Por favor, por favor, por favor, ah por favor""   Oh I said, ?Dear Lord, por favor, I need a favor   Well can You help me get back that what is no more?.How many ears must one man have,   Before he can hear people cry?.(who can paint their face up?).I'm loving you, you're out of range..when I open      (that shine and shine)      when I close      (will I have my green eyes?).Oh   How, how are you?.Scrambling distress signals on random frequencies,   Forever repatriated on guilt laden morning planes..If we get through one more night,   If we get through one more night,      This is not a horse race where winners beat the time,   This is not a funeral with mourners in a line,   This is not a sitcom where everything's alright,   This is not a prison with terror through the night..Anything?.Why do I say, don't walk away   You'll be the way your were before   When you don't want me anymore      Don't turn around, don't ever leave   A lonely room where empty days   Are gathering to meet me when you're gone-   Gone- how in the world will I go on      (Don't walk away) all you gotta do is stay   (Don't walk away) all you gotta do is stay   (Don't walk away)      [Chorus]   Don't walk away, don't say goodbye   Don't turn around, don't let it die   When shadows fall, when day is done   All through the night, all of my life   Don't walk away      Is it a dream, when will it end   When everything we've ever known   Has ended and I'm all alone      Where will I go, where will I be   The feelings that I've never shown   Maybe I'll find the answer when you're gone-   Gone- how in the world will I go on      (Don't walk away) all you gotta do is stay   (Don't walk away) all you gotta do is stay   (Don't walk away)      [Chorus].(DR.

"Yes, I believe that libraries should remove certain materials from the book shelves if they are found offensive to someone. First of all a oerson doesn't go to the library to get offended. Also if the liberian should know whats appropiate for the library. And items like the ones who offend people should not even be in a public area.     A person does't go to the library to see something that offends them. People go to the library to read, study and to have a quiet time. And the people that go to use the library for a resourse, should not find themselves in a situation were they feel that they are being offended by a book, movie or magazine, because of what the autor says in the writeing. People might get offended and stop going to the library.     Also the liberian is incharged of the items he wants to display in his library. If the liberian feel that a book its okay to be displayed he can dispay it, but if the book is offensive to someone else, he should be asked to remove the book. And if the book is resourceful for study the liberian should keep it in an area were people that want the book can ask for it.     Stuff like that should not even be published in a public area. I think that there should be a law that does not allow offencive literature, music, movies etc... In libraries. Now this days people are allowed to donate items of litereature or intertainment to libraries, but i think that people should make sure that the items they are donateing are okay to be displayed.     So yes I believe that offensive materials shoud be removed from the libraries. Because libraries are places were you go to have a quiet time to read and not to get offended. The librarian should be incharged of what he or she wants to dislay. Aand last stuff like that should not even be in a public area.We've come this way before   A hundred times or more   But someone's watching over us   And we believe in God we trust   But if we hold on

together's made   Of tears and pride   We know they can never take us down   And freedom's why   Together let's raise our freedoms flag   Where eagles fly.When he looks into her eyes   He sees only

you know that it exists   Then the lover that you miss   Will come to you on those cold, cold nights      When you've been loved   When you know it holds such bliss   Then the lover that you kissed

You saved my soul   You smiled at me   Like Jesus to a child      And what have I learned   From all these tears   I've waited for you all those years   And just when it began   He took you away      But I still say   When you find love   When you know that it exists   Then the lover that you miss   Will come to you on those cold, cold nights      When you've been loved   When you know it holds

"I think that books, music, movies, magazines, and etc. should be aloud to stay on the shelves of stores and libraries. We have to ask our selves these questions. Why should we take them out of libraries? What would people have to read when those books tell us about what went on in the early days, such as slavery, automobiles, and etc.? Who wants to sit and read about other stuff that is just down right boring?     Why should we take down the books in the library? We shouldn't take the books down off the shelves. We @MONTH1 have the right to take down the books but why should we. It is taking away the knowledge for our children. We would be taking away a lot of stuff the our children should know about, such as the slavery, and famous people.     What would we have to read about if we took most of the books out of the library? We would have nothing to read about other then the stuff that doesn't matter to us anymore. You have to think about if we took all of the books that were inappropraite off the shelves of the library there wouldn't be anymore books. Every book out there has something bad in it, so we would have to take away all the books other than the little kids books.      Who would want to go to the library and want to sit there knowing that they are going to be reading something that is not interesting and just boring? I can tell u who wants to do that. Nobody,'' it's just dumb to do it and has no point, unless you are old, then you @MONTH1 like to, but not everybody is old. Reading is fun to some kids and they want to read about different stuff, but if we take the books they can't.      We don't need to take any books out of the libraries? There would be no reason to go to the library or even read books, cause there isn't any good ones. We are just taking away something that is really big to us @CAPS1, and without those books there is no history for us to study. Our kids need to see those books even if we don't want them to. That is the early days and they need to know about all of it and how it was back then when they didn't have everything we do now. You can't take away something that is fun to do so why take them.tell me true   Oshiete ikiru imi wo      Forever love, forever dream   Afureru namida no naka   Kagayaku kisetsu ga eien ni kawaru made      Forever love.She looked at me and did the bosa nova   I smiled at her and then just walked away   Then the lights came on and it was over   To my surprise, she wasn't a girl at all      So I packed it up and took to a rock show...   Where you can feel the pulse getting stronger   And you can only hear the beat for so long   I asked if there was any way to stop it      No, he said, just smile and act as if...   You worship the very ground on which they walk on...   No way   A temporary absence of gesture      A hidden meaning known to everyone   A slight misconception of leizure   Don't see how that could hurt anyone...I know...but   Spirit, excellence, further

the corner from the home I call a house   I sit and play sudoku 'til I figure some shit out   I drink the days first coffee and I smoke   The last cigarette of my life      And I'm wondering out of all the crazy places that I've been   Would it ever be as good as sitting here just with a friend   Where it's always understood it might be time   To switch the coffee to the wine      Life is just a little part of what the world will do   To get it's point across it beats you 'til your black and blue   And decides just when your in or when your out   'Cuz when your through your through      Yeah, Yeah..The day of judgement's come,   And you can bet that I've been resting,   for this testing,   Digesting every word the experts say..The dawn an' I arrive at home at last..Like a ghost ship of fools, lost and floating out to sea      And they climb and they fall   Yet they struggle on the same fault   But they're only human, trying to get by   And praying to heaven they might find out   Why are we human   Mere flesh and blood   We're afraid to go on without someone to hold us up.So much for pretending..Life on the freeway, night shift 'til dawn patrol..Hold my hand any other night of the week,   It's all right..You know hard times, just an old friend, just an old friend to me   I say hard times, just an old friend, just an old friend to me   Tell me now old friend, oh when you gonna let me be?.In the night time ....Well give it up to me   You got me boy and I surrender   Lets get you back to my      Over and over you run in my mind   Give me one look and you know I'm fine   Can't you see we're only wasting our time   Baby thought you understood      It's the way you look, me   It's the way you move, me   And the way you touch, me   It's the way you love, me      Baby it's simple to see   Baby it's simple   This is where I'm meant to be   This is where I'm meant to be      You stole a piece of my heart   You stole a piece of my heart baby   You're making me start all over      It's the way you love, me   And the way you move, me      It's the way you love, me   And the way you move, me   And the way you touch, me   It's the way you love, me   And the way you love      Every little thing you do   Everything that you do   You can put me in the mood   You put me in the mood      Now I'm looking straight at you   You're looking at me too   Yeah you know what I want

 You just can't fly      They anchored our dream yacht to ocean bed   Chained our ideal home to bicycle shed   Clamped our racing car before we sat in driver's seat   Tied our shooting stars and wrapped them round a tree      We could've courted Einstein   Could've courted Marx   We could've gone for strolls   Like other families do in parks   Son you were born a dud   In a family without sparks   Yes you've got those chicken wings   You just can't fly      The checkered flag   That losers despise   Never flew in our port   Or harbored in our eyes   Cause we always formed that queue   For second prize   This family's got those chicken wings   We just can't fly      Our winning tickets ripped up into shreds   The tale of this family, is its heads   We're bouncing on a pogo stick   Without any springs   It hurts me to admit this   But we've got those chicken wings      Yes you've got those chicken wings   And all the luggage that the failure brings   Is a swallow flying high that sings   Look he's got those chicken wings   He may as well die.Cracklin' Rosie, get on board   We're gonna ride till there ain't no more to go   Taking it slow   Lord, don't you know   Have made

water in your eyes..What would he tell the strangers?.I don't have a lot of girls,   But I gotta know   I'll get the respect that I give   That's just the way I live   Because the last girl   I had

Mississippi tonight   I headed out west   To seek my fortune and fame   I sure made a mess   It took it all but my name   Why I ever left?"
"I've recently read a letter from Katherine Paterson about censorship in libraries. This is my opinion expressed in words about how I feel about the whole topic.     I've been reading ever since I hit first grade. To be honest, I couldn't tell you the names of @PERCENT1 of them because... well I just can't remember them. I'd like to think that it's because I have a horrible memory, but the truth is, they were just unappealing and unmemorable books. In all aspects, these books could be considered a waste of my life. Back then, I guess I only read them because I had nothing better to do, which is horrible because you should read books because you want to. I stopped reading books at around seventh grade because every book I picked up seemed to be extremely boring and it would take the first one hundred pages to actually have something decent happen.          Luckily, there is light at the end of this tunnel. Every now and then you come across a book that changes your life. Not literally, but it feels that way at the time (which is what you should feel). These are the books I remember. These 'life-changing' books all have things in them that would interest anyone who picks them up. Unfortunately, these things would be viewed as innappropriate to a select audience. For example, one book @MONTH1 talk about murder and be viewed as highly offensive by a person whose mother had been murdered, whereas the same book could be viewed as a piece of art by someone who has escaped the terribleness of death. Apparently it has gotten to the point where people would have the books censored or have them removed the libraries completely. I can stand idle no longer.     Books all go through a long, drawn-out process before they are shelf-ready. They need to be written, read, and selected to be published. For some books, this can take years. To completely alienate these books is extremely unfair to the time that was put into them. If you don't like the books, don't read them. It's as simple as that. If that's not enough reason for you, think of it this way: a book about a child getting raped and fighting to overcome it could serve as inspiration for rape victims. Or, a book about someone's parents dying could help a child in the same situation overcome the grief.     All books serve a purpose and should remain staunch on the shelves of local book stores, regardless of the methods used in them. Even if they don't appeal to you, it could be a completely different experience for someone else halfway across the world. Let these books serve their purpose..Oh baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, tell me, do you want to dance?.Oh laudate dominum.There he goes, right there with his toy souljas   I'm all by myself, let's git dis ova   Dogg down on the whole crowd, don't nobody move   Where my homeboi at, what he say he gon' do?.Come, come, come   Yeah, yeah, yeah   Come, come, come   Yeah, yeah, yeah....Sittin in the porch swing   Listenin' to the light rain   Beatin' on the tin roof   Baby, just a-me and you   Rockin' with the rhythm of the rain      Slide on over   Baby hold me closer   Movin' to and fro   Just swayin' like a slow freight train   Rockin' with the rhythm of the rain      So let the breeze keep blowin'   (Rockin' with the rhythm of the rain that's fallin')   (Night birds are singin' the crickets are callin')   Oh, my heart will never be the same..I'm feeling left out..It's the pride that makes you feel that you belong   It's the pride that keeps you strong      Don't you think it's fascinating?.The little man had no gratitude..There's a liquor store right down the block I'll get it   Can't even feed the pain in my heart   Oh I'm longing to find   ( I'm longing to find )      A piece of the bigger pie, oh my   ( A different kind )   Only it takes a little time   ( A little time )   (No don't do it)      Don't go and put a bullet in your head   Just turn your life around instead   Don't go and put a bullet in your head      Oh my oh my oh my ...

"I beleive that certian things such as books, movies, music, magazines, etc., should and shouldn't be taken off of the shelf. The reason i think that  they should stay on the shelf is because it might interest some of the people that read them. If people don't like them, or they think that it is offensive, they shouldn't go to that library.     I don't get offended by anything. When I am going through the library I have seen people get offended by some of the  things that they have on the shelfs. Reading things and them getting offensive is a totally different thing. People that read things and get offended by it, should have a say in whether it is on the shelf or not.     The reason I think that some of the things shouldn't be on the shelf is because it might be inappropriete. It might not be good for the eyes of people.     I think that all libraries should carry the same content in them. So that way noone is making a big deal about what is on the shelves..Would you like to see the Pope on the end of a rope - do you think he's a fool?.All the hopeless dreamers..Take a walk,   Cross the ice,   Melts too quickly for us to reach the other side..I didn't know you were so obviously..Savior, Savior, hear my humble cry   While on others thou art calling do not pass me by..Lay at my side and shut out the world   Warm this cold heart and wrap me in love   Pour magic into a space made for you   Lifetimes of longing are to live through   Blue blue blue blue blue blue   All of my life I've hungered for you   All my lost days of dreaming are through   Riding the clouds on a mission of schemes   Now you are here oh how simple it seems   Blue blue blue blue blue blue   Blue is my world cold is my name   Love was my problem with no one to blame and you   Taught me how to see light shine in me   Light is reflected so easily   I said blue no more blue don't say good-bye   You leave me breathless with nothing to say   Turned me burned me and blew me away   And if you leave like a ghost without trace   This night of love means a world I can face   Blue blue blue blue blue blue   Holding you close timeless together   Heaven just spoke freeze this moment forever and   All other images fall from my eyes   Love you have come to me straight from the skies   I said blue no more blue   I said blue no more blue don't say good-bye   I will always know that love can live.Ala-ala nating dalawa   Sa isip ko'y di mawala   Tanda-tanda ko pa na buong puso,   Minahal kita   Bakit

better go back down,   And if I can find a book of matches,   I'm goin' to burn this hotel down..Each stars a pool   Of water..Honey make like you a river."
"Yes, I think that some books should be taken out of all libraries. No little kid should be looking at or saying those things. Some of the books could offend some people when they don't know it.      Parents need to watch what there kids read and watch on a daily basis. Kids need to know why they shouldn't watch those shows or read those books. Maybe if parents would watch there kids they would mind better than what they do.      Some of the books could offend people when they don't know it. No little kid should be looking at or reading those books or movies. That is why i think those books should be taken out of all libraries.Not bad enough      So you put a hold on happiness   ... a day, a week, a year   You got to bring somethin' to this party, boy   If you party here      And if you're lookin' for love   You better look some other way   If you're lookin' for love   I have to ask you   How bad do you want it?.The day I can control myself.You're not around..The devil's in the dreaming   You see yourself descending from a building to the ground   You watch the sky receding   You spin to see the traffic rising up   And it's so quiet   You're surprised   And then you wake      For all the things I'm losing   I might as well resign myself to try and make a change   But I'm going down to Hollywood   They're gonna make a movie from the things that they find   crawling round my brain      I wish I was a girl so that you could believe me   And I could shake this static every time I try to sleep   I wish for all the world that I could say,   ""Hey Elizabeth, you know, I'm doing alright these days."".To the centre of the city in the night, waiting for you..What's up now, don't you worry night and day   Always remember, don't you remember me?.I got something for you,   And I think you're sexy,   And if you want me let me know..Hey baby, watcha gonna do?.If I can find the secret in the green   I'll let you know..Don't you forget about me,   When you're a celebrity,   It will be only you and me before too long..In the end,   You are my one true friend..I've been slow to get you but I'm working as hard as I can..Hey   My thing is a real fine thing   It's a thing, it's a real fine thing   It ain't broke, it don't need a fix   Thirty six, twenty two, thirty six   I got a gyroscope goin' round and round   Got a Thunderbird take me all over town   Got a transistor radio standin' on the mix   Thirty six, twenty two, thirty six   Thirty six, eighteen, thirty six   Where'd she go?.And when you lose control,   You'll reap the harvest you have sown,   And as the fear grows,   The bad blood slows and turns to stone..All I can do is love you 'til the end of all time   One day, time will tell when you're living in yesterday   Thinking of things to do, thinking of things to say   Thinking of things divine, find a bottom line   Is there anybody home?.If I can save the world      Yeah I'm on a Mission From God   Sounds kinda crazy but I like it a lot   I'm an answer to the man up above   It's me he's speaking of   On a mission, on a mission, on a mission, a mission, a mission, mission, mission, mission   Yeah I'm on a mission.Just the moon and you and i.

"We've all heard the songs on the radio that are censored by constant beeps because of bad words, and we've all seen  @ORGANIZATION1 shows and movies that are the same way.  Books and magazines are censored the same way by either blocking out the offensive language or replacing the letters with astrics.  Numerous amounts of people see no harm in this and support it, while others think that it is no big deal because, eventually, people are going to end up seeing the bad things anyway.      If you were an author, musician, or director, wouldn't you want your work to be seen and published as you had originally written it?  Most of those people would, and get angry when their work is edited.  They want their work to be heard, and sometimes editing out the disrespectful things cause the message not to be understood as clear as it would be with those certain words.  This can also cause the original message to be completely missed, and the work could end up meaning something totally different then what it was originally supposed to mean.      However, another question arises: If you were a parent, would you want your kids to see those inappropriate scenes in movies, or hear harsh words in music?  Most would not want that at all and strongly encourage editing out things that their children are too young to hear and understand.  Eventually, though, kids are going to be faced with those things.      In conclusion, cenorship should just be ignored.  Children are going to end up hearing bad words, seeing inappropriate things, and reading offensive passages in books or magazines.  Censoring things can mess up the original message being brought to attention and anger many authors and musicians.  There are loads of harsh things in the world, its impossible to just edit them all out.Gone fishin' (keep it shady, I got me a big one staked out)   Mmm, you ain't workin' anymore (I don't have to work, I got me a piece of Gary)   Cows need milkin' in the barn (I have the twins on that detail, they each take a side)   But you just don't give a darn (give 'em four bits a cow and hand lotion)   You just never seem to learn (man, you taught me)   You ain't got no ambition (you're convincin' me)      Gone fishin' (bah-boo-dah-do-dah-do-dah-do)   Got your hound dog by your side (that's old Cindy-Lou goin' with me)   Gone fishin' (mmm-hmm-hmm-hmm-hmm)   Fleas are bitin' at his hide (get away from me boy, you bother me)      Mmm, folks won't find us now because   Mister Satch and Mister Cros   We gone fishin' instead of just a-wishin'   Bah-boo-baby-bah-boo-bah-bay-mmm-bo-bay   Oh yeah!.Take a look overhead   Hey, there!.I guess not   I've never seen a lot of beauty   In my life..Baby I've been drifting away   Dreaming all day   Of holidng you   Touching you   The only thing I want to do   Is be with you   As close to you   As I can be      Let's make love   All night long   Until all our strength is gone   Hold on tight   Just let go   I want to feel you in my soul   Until the sun comes up   Let's make love   Oh, baby      Do you know what you do to me   Everything inside of me   Is wanting you   And needing you   I'm so in love with you   Look in my eyes   Let's get lost tonight   In each other      Let's make love   All night long   Until all our strength is gone   Hold on tight   Just let go   I want to feel you in my soul   Until the sun comes up   Let's make love      Let's make love   All night long   Until all our strength is gone   Hold on tight   Just let go   I want to feel you in my soul   Until the sun comes up   Oh, until the sun comes up   Let's make love      Oh baby, let's make love   All night long   All night long   Let's make love.The girl I always have dreams about   The one I just can't live without   Is it so tell me now   Could it be you   Can you imagine what it's like to always live without love   I need to have you in my life   I think I know that now   My open heart (open heart)   Make you a part (make you apart)   A part of this lovin I've been keepin (i've been keeping for)   And I might just give it all to you   Oh ho      Chorus:   Could it be you?.Freak out!.and alive   There was nobody to call me up for favors   No one's future to decide   You know I'd go back there tomorrow   But for the work I'm taking on   ?.Lately you're so far away,   You just don't seem to hold me like you used to   Something's going on   I've got that old feeling, you're leaving   I'm so tired of goodbye   I can't wait on your love forever   While you change your mind   Morning finds us face to face   I feel you staring through me while I'm talking   Familiar looks I recognize the same old looks that said goodbye the last time   Something I'm used to   I've got that old feeling, you're leaving   I'm so tired of goodbye   I can't wait on your love forever   While you change your mind.She seemed kinda worried, Like something was wrong   Tyson at my back, I had to move along   [Chorus]   [Repeat chorus till fade].Ev'ry day I thank god   That I'm such a cool, chick baby..I should know cause I've seen it before   I think I gotta let her go, she only loves in stereo!.""well your rhythm is off"" I reply,   ""Now you must dance the dance   That you imply!"".Drift away, hey, just drift away,   Drifting away on this looney balloon..You ask yourself the question   ""What more could I do?"".All right, now look, look, we've...we've seen a lot of things happened in the city,   and everything's turned around..Now I tell you I've been around..Hail the Son of Righteousness!.I will go Lord, if You lead me..(Yeah, Ah-Ah-Ah-Ah-Ah-Ark)   Oo-ooh-ooh, hoo yeah, yeah   Yeah, yeah   Yeah-ah-ah   Yeah-ah-ah   Yeah-ah-ah   Yeah-ah-ah   Yeah, yeah, yeah      Seven A.

"If I owned or worked at a librarie, I would have books, music, movies and magazines that to many people are offensive. But I would not have the offensive books, music, movies, and magazines in the childrens area of the librarie.But I would have them in the adult area.         @CAPS5 I would keep that type of books, music or movies might you ask? Well because the adult and older tenageers should be able to handle and act like adult when reading the book, watching the movie, listening to music. If the type of book, movie, or music is causing violent behavior around the town then i will completly remove the item from the shelf. Its that simple.           If parents get mad and angree because of these books, movie, and music don't let your children watch, read, or listen to them. Pick out a childs book like @CAPS1 or @ORGANIZATION1, don't pick out a book from @PERSON1. Let your children read a book with lots of pictures and color. Watch @CAPS1 or @ORGANIZATION1 not @CAPS3 on a @CAPS4.         My questions is, '@CAPS5 not let people read and watch something that they want even if it is offensive?' @CAPS6 people love watching the scary and offensive movie or listening to the rap music. People live in defferent worlds even though we all live in one.      In my oppenion offensive books, music and movies should stay in libraries. Just little and younger kids shouls not read, watch or listen to them.Whoo!.Slipped away from me..You're the fuel to the fire You're the weapons of war   You're the irony of justice And the father of law      I've been waiting for a while to meet you   For the chance to shake your hand   To give you thanks for all the suffering you command   And when all is over and we return to dust   Who will be my judge and which one do I trust?.Accidents can happen, accidents can happen, accidents can happen to you      [Chorus]   Accidents can happen, accidents can happen, look out!.Lies   La-la-la-la-lies   It's all lies   Only lies   La-la-la-la-lies   You're all lies..How did you get so strong?.Don't you know, don't you know   Everyday I love you more?.Gonna take a taxi   Gotta get to you!.It was   Sealed with a kiss!.They can't make you real,   Tell me where you came from,   And where you're going to..That pretty little world that beams so bright   That pretty little world that seems delightful cambered   Let me learn...let me learn...

"I @CAPS1 would like @CAPS4 if nothing was censored, but I don't matter, right? I am the kid that has no choice in the matter. @CAPS3 should I not care about what I am forced not to see? I am sure there are alot of parents that dont follow the censorship rules. Like buying a rated '@CAPS2' movie, or game for their kid that is @NUM1, and not @NUM2 years old, but @CAPS4 does matter that the parents are following the law. I say shrew the law, because when @CAPS4 comes down to @CAPS4, its the parents right to tell/show there kid about things, not the goverment.      I Think that @CAPS5 have never really had a choice in matters that affects them directly, and I think we should. @CAPS5 have to follow what ever rules untill there @NUM2 years of age: @CAPS3? I wish I knew @CAPS3, but I dont. Because there is no logical reason for @CAPS5 not to have a vote on what affects them.           For all I know there could be a law out right now that is going to make my generation less powerfull then the last generation. I am not saying that this is true, I am only saying that its possible for some thing like this to happen.     Video games, They are my weakness I admit, but I don't see a reason for games to be censored. When people say things like '@CAPS5 who play video games with violence will make them murders.' @CAPS4 makes me frustrated. There is not one single thing that proves that.      I have known @CAPS5 who have been censored all there life, and when they learn about @CAPS4 all they cant even handle @CAPS4. Its sad really to not beable to watch the news and learn what is going on in the world. Just because they have been kept away from all that all there life.     I don't know how or where they get this censorship idea from in the first place. Did their parents tell them @CAPS4 was bad, and never watch/read @CAPS4? Where did they hear @CAPS4 from? I beleive @CAPS4 came from the media @CAPS4 self. I can see the headlines now, '@CAPS5 watching @CAPS6 movie cause them to be murders.' Then they would have some made up percentage on how manny @CAPS5 turn in to a murder that watch @CAPS6 movie compare to @CAPS5 that don't.     What I am really saying is that I try not to let other peoples beleifs get in my head and change my own beleifs. Even by me writing this @MONTH1 have cause someone to change there beleifs, and I really @CAPS1 hope I haven't..Pay me what you owe me   Bitch better have my (bitch better have my)   Bitch better have my (bitch better have my)   Bitch better have my money!.Now there's something that clutches the heart   A melody that stays      Year after year   I love all the many charms about you   Above all I want my arms around you   I'm already late for my train   But I don't think about that   I think of you, George   At your piano, sweating in the summer heat      By the way, did you get your girl,   Did you by your house in the country?.It was great fun, but it was just one of those things!.It's the only place I don't feel alone   It's the only place I'm at home,   I'm in love with the dance floor!.And I would not be tortured, tormented and cheated   How I wish Id never loved you      And I could see as you kissed her   Youd never come back to me      Oh, I wish Id never loved you   I wish youd never burned me with your kiss   Oh, how can I go on like this?.[Verse 1]   In Britain's Georgian times   There were so many crimes   No time to hang each crook guilty of a felony   Cos there's no room to jail you   They'd send you to Australia   To live in our new-fangled penal colony   Think that sounds like heaven?.Tanto semplice, ?.You know god has answered my prayers   Won't you listen to me now   God for sure will answer my prayers   Won't you listen to me now   God will answer your prayers   Just ask him and God is sure to answer all your prayers   Oh come on and lets fall in love      Your the one that I've been waiting for   Come on lets fall in love   Your the woman that I adore   Don't you wanna   Fall in love with me baby   Don't you wanna   Fall in love with me this time, this time, this time   Oh, no no no   Don't you wanna fall   Don't you wanna fall in love   Oh, no no no   Yeah   This time      O.K..The snake will always bite the hand that deeds him..[Chorus]      Yeah mom and dad, really nothing left to say   I'll be sure to keep you posted if she swing it back this way   I guess I'm not as sad as you think I might be   The part that makes me mad is that they didn't invite me..If you think I want the life you choose to live   I don't think I want the love you've got to give   If you think my goals could be so trivial and small   Then, I don't think you know me at all   Born between the covers of your fashion books   You think you can make it, girl, on just your looks   But you could never bring me up   Between us stands a wall   No, I don't think you know me at all   Believing in the promise painted in your smile   I've chased what I was running from, girl, all my life   I've known you a hundred times in memories I recall, but   I don't think you know me at all   I don't think you know me at all..Down down down and goodbye..I'm findin' all the answers,   It's the questions I don't know...

"Do I belive that some books, movies, magazines, or ext., shuold be removed do to the fuct some people might find them offensive? NO, I belive that every should have the chance to see it to other then the just the people how did and thought it was offensive. Someone could really like it or a group of people could.Even if some people find an object offensive someone else might need that object for something like school work.     Lets say the libraries remove a human trafficking book from the libraries becuase people find it offensive. Then a local school has a praject on human trafficking. The students go to the libraries to get some books on it. Now do to somebody elses dislike of the books these kids don't get to use those books to do thier reshearch.     It wouldn't be fair to everyone to remove objects from the libraries just cause some other people find it offensive. The libraries is a public place that everyone has the right to go and borrow stuff from. So no i don't belive that libraries should remove books, movies, magazines, or ext., do to the fact that some other people @MONTH1 find them offensive..There since the cord, the license, or the reasons we understood will be..To see to taste, to touch the world   In jaded glory..It's a time for heroes,   When our back's to the wall   It's a time for the hero....Oh Maybellene, why can't you be true?.Who's the fool and who'd the liar..(Time to pay up, mother fucker.).See how they run like pigs from a gun, see how they fly..Won't you stay with me, baby,   I can't go on....I really don't like it...ain't nothing I can do..Shameless as a man can be..Where do I go from here?.You'd better run, you'd better fly..Today I killed a man..YING YANG!!!.Hangover)      [Chorus].Tonight's the night I get in some shit [Yeah]   Deep cover on the incognito tip..A traditional song which was a likely inspiration for Where The Wild Roses Grow..Take a nail   Fuck it take M-N-O-P, learn how to spell   I'll pull up to the gate   And we'll skate on this country, faggot   And until then, fuck 'em, they can have it   Slumerican means   Slum American breed   Gutter raised with worldwide dreams, yeah      [Hook]   Put your hands to the sky   I'm a bullet in a barrel with a hair pin trigger now   And I'mma landslide   I'm a head case train wreck avalanche comin' down   Put your hands to the sky   I'm a ready made party   I'm whiskey in a bottle now   Lalalalalalalalalaa   I'm whiskey in a bottle now      [Verse 2]   Still on that gas like   The bottom of my signature shoe, 'Bama red   I'm on that ass like Alabama did LSU   You said ""Oh lord"" Bible Belt raised   In your mouth like a cold sore   Rolled Ford's?.Along side Wyclef, you know how we do it..I don't want to be the one that make you lonely   I don't want to be the one that make you cry   I just want to take you in my arms and hold you   And keep you there until the day I die..Whatever happened to you?"
"The media is destroying our youth! this is something we hear everyday. Teachers are telling us this, while parents and grandparents are telling us how mush different their world used to be. They explain how the media of their time wasn't as open about sex and violence. They go on to say how they didn't have violent video games teaching children that killing is alright. Because of these people, we think that the media is repsonsible for the wrong in the world of @DATE1. The truth is that it isn't the medias fault, it is the parents. It is the parents responsiblity to teach the children of the world the difference between right and wrong. If these such parent do their jobs correctly then the youth of @DATE1 will not need for everything to be censored. It is my firm belief that their should not be any censorships. When their is censorship people can govern what we learn, destroy what goes agiainst their beliefs, and destroy our god given right to freedom of speech    Censorship will detroy the knowlege available @DATE1. We have had seen censorship in our history. When we look back we see that the @ORGANIZATION1's censored and destroyed anything that went against them. We hated it when they had book burnings and destroyed the custums, art, and music that the government felt was wrong for their people. How would we be any different if we did it. We could potentailly be destroying somones way of life. We would be destroying what could possibly be tomorrows masterpeice. In censoring we would be detroying history.By destroying history we would be detroying the brilliance that is learning.     If we allow censorship anything that goes against our own personal beliefs would be destroyed. If you ask any christian if they would allow their children to read the muslim book of faith, the @LOCATION1, they would tell you no. It would be the same if you asked a muslim if they would let their children read the @CAPS1. The point is that if their is cansorship we would be destroying other peoples beliefs. No one has the right to govern what others believe in the world.     Also in censorship we would be exterminating our freedom of speech and the freedom to express ourselves. If we don't allow peole to read what someone else has written because we believe it is wrong, then we are taking away their ability to learn new ideas because everyone has different opinionsand theories. Every newspaper would shut down because they would all be saying the same thing. No one would want to read them because they would already know what they would hav eto say. When we start giving up rights such as freedom of speech we will not be able to stop those people who took those right from taking more.      Of course their will always be things in the media, in books, and in music that we don't like.Their will be cursing, nudity, and violence everywhere we turn. This is not because we want it there, but because these things are a part of life. They are the dark parts that we dont want to see.  If you dont want to see dont look. Just dont close everyone elses eyes because you dont like what you see.     Our learning, our beliefs, and our freedom of speech are too important to just give up to censorship. We cannot alow others to dictate, in this matter, what is right for us. Our media is too intertwined with our lives. Who's right is it to decide what is right for our lives. If we start giving up these small freedoms then those taking them from us will not stop. They will just keep taking what freedoms we have until we are nothing more that a dictatorship.Don't you know I love the way you hold me   I feel so safe in your arms   It means so much the way you hold my hand   All a part of your charm..They say love is just a game   They say time can heal the pain   Sometimes you win, sometimes you lose   And I guess I'm just a fool   I keep holding on to you      I told you once you were the one   You know that I die for you   Oh, though it hurts to see you go   Oh, this time you should know   I won't try to stop you      Don't you forget about me baby   Don't you forget about me now   Some day you'll turn around and ask me, why did I let you go      So you try to fake a smile   You don't wanna break my heart   I can see that you're afraid   But baby it's to late   'Cause I'm already dying      Don't you forget about me baby   Don't you forget about me now   Some day you'll turn around and ask me, why did I let you go      Don't you forget about me baby   Don't you forget about me now   Some day you'll turn around and ask me, why did I let you go      Why did I let you      Don't you forget about me baby   Don't you forget about me now   Some day you'll turn around and ask me, why did I let you go      Why did I let you go      Wherever I go   I won't forget about you   Oh no, no, no   Wherever you go   Don't you forget about me.Medium..(2x Chorus)      Tell you that I love you   Now they've carried you away   Tell you that I love you   Now they've carried you away   Tell you that I love you   Now they've carried you away.I know,you're waiting so close to me,   But how will you ever see, as time rolls away,   Lonely, but tryin' to be so proud,   And just as I turn around, the lights go down..Baby, I love, I love, I love, I love every little thing   about you baby   Oh yea, I love, I love, I love, I love every little thing   about you baby, mmm yea      Though they say that I am wrong   Cause my love is strong   There's only one that I place above you..His old guitar swung across his back   His dusty boots is his Cadillac   Flamin' just a blowin' in the wind   Ain't see a bed in so long it's a sin      Now you may call him a tramp   But I know it goes a little deeper than that   He's a highway chile   Walk on brother   Don't let no one stop ya      Highway chile   Yeah yeah yeah   Highway chile   Go on down the highway   Highway chile   Yeah yeah   Highway chile.Written by Warren Zevon 1995 Zevon Music BMI   Once upon a time these stories always start   There lived a handsome prince and he had a happy heart   And a princess, too--she was a beautiful kid   She said she'd never leave him but she did   Sometimes love is wet and cold   Similar to rain, just a hard to hold   Love can make you sad and blue   If you don't watch out it'll fall all over you   Everybody knows that winter can be nice   You can play in the snow, you can skate on the ice   But you can't skate far when the ice gets thin   'Cause you might fall in   Sometimes love is wet and cold   Similar to rain, just as hard to hold   Love can make you sad and blue   If you don't watch out it'll fall all over you   Gray skies everywhere   Storm clouds know your name   Sadness in the air   Feels like rain   Sometimes love is wet and cold   Similar to rain, just a hard to hold   Love can make you sad and blue   If you don't watch out it'll fall all over you.Letters are written   Words are spoken   Some hearts are better left unbroken   How will love survive   How will love survive   Little by little, step by step   We

waiting   Baby, you cry   See all the fools babe with their lies   Our love survive   How does love survive?.Tenement slum      Ooh-ooh-ooh-ah      You think that I don't feel love   But what I feel for you is real love   In other's eyes I see reflected   A hurt, scorned and rejected      Love child, never meant to be   Love child, born in poverty   Love child, never meant to be   Love child, take a look at me      I started my life in an old, cold run down tenement slum   My father left   He never even married mom   I shared the guilt my mama knew   So afraid that others knew I had no name      This love we're contemplating   Is worth the pain of waiting   We'll only end up hating   The child we maybe creating      Love child, never meant to be   Love child, scorned by society   Love child, always second best   Love child, different from the rest      Hold on   Hold on (Ooooooohhh)      I started school, in a worn, torn,   Dress that somebody threw out   I knew the way it felt, to always live in doubt   To be without the simple things   So afraid my friends would see the guilt in me      Don't think that I don't need you   Don't think I don't wanna please you   No child of mine 'll be bearing   The name of shame I've been wearing      Love child, never quite as good   Afraid   Ashamed   Misunderstood      But I'll always love you   I'll always love you   I'll always love you   I'll always love you   I'll always love you   I'll always love you   You-ooo-ooo   You-ooo-ooo   You-ooo-ooo.Wonder if he'll ever know   He's in the best selling show   Is there life

"The right to remove a book off of a shelf is not good thing to do. My view on the subject is that, if this begins there will only empty shelfs in librarys across the country. Once the removing of books start there will be hardly any left.     We use books everyday, for students we use them to learn and for a entertainment during someclasses. Books help us learn things, like new words we've never heard of before, or some major point in history we should know about. Even as adults some of them like to read in there free time.     I think its wrong to remove a book off of the shelf, just because a few or a bunch of people think its inaproprate. If it is the librarys should have section for those books that dont let the little kids go in that section. their is a problem for this idea, what books should go into this section of the library? A way to solve that question would be to elect a nation wide library service to set it up and have people vote on which books to to remove or put into a speacial section in the librarys across the nation. This idea goes the same for everything found at a library.     Another soulution to this matter is that, the librarys across the nation have another labeling system like the dewey decimal system but use both. this new system could contain information like reviews from crtics about the book, or what happend during the book. This would inform the reader more on what he is about to engrossed in for the next week or so.     The books, music, magazines found in librarys should be left their for a reason. Sombody wrote, or composed for a reason. so people like you and me can enjoy good stories in books and read informing magazines ad listen to good music.Where angels sing and spread their wings my love's on high..Sailing on and on and north across the sea   Sailing on and on and north 'til all is calm..So much I've never broken through..You're so deluded,   You think that I'm real..I've never quibbled   If it was ribald..Higher, higher, higher and higher   Now can you hand-jive, baby?.Let me take you there, show you a living story   Let me show you others such as me   Why did I ever leave?.Savoring my piece of pie..Ain't nobody (Nobody)   Loves me better (Loves me better)   Makes me happy   Makes me feel this way (Nobody)   Ain't nobody (Nobody)   Loves me better (Than you)      I wait for nighttime to come to bring you to me..Nothing to do but work work work   Nothing alas alack   Nowhere to go but out out out   Nowhere to come but back      It's Christmas day in the workhouse   They're handing out lollipops   Progress would be wonderful   If only it would stop      No bees no honey no work no money      Nothing to do but think think think   Nothing alas alack   Nowhere to go for a drink drink drink   Nowhere to come but back      It's Christmas day in the doghouse   Lassie's gone barking mad   Here comes Father Christmas   Handing out lucky bags      No bees no honey no work no money   Nothing to do but work work work      Money      King bank is calling.....I want to live, I want to give   I've been a miner for a heart of gold   It's these expressions I never give   That keeps me searching for a heart of gold   And I'm getting old      Keep me searching for a Heart of gold   And I'm getting old      I've been to Hollywood, I've been to Redwood   I crossed the ocean for a heart of gold   I've been admired by, it's such a fine light   That keeps me searching for a heart of gold   And I'm getting old      Keep me searching for a Heart of gold   And I'm getting old      Keep me searching for a heart of gold   Keep me searching and I'm growing old.It's a sudden rush..Ah!.This woman is my destiny   She said oh oh oh   Shut up and dance with me      Oh oh oh shut up dance with me   Oh oh oh shut up dance with me.He stood in a field where barley grows..Take my hand.).Oh man, I just had the hub caps painted!.It ain't cause I'm the only one left darlin',   Bout the time the sun rises west,   Feelin' groovy, lookin' fine..And every mornin' I wake up,   Can't hide my tears..Love is touch, touch is love   Love is reaching, reaching love   Love is asking to be loved      Love is you   You and me   Love is knowing   You can be      Love is free, free is love   Love is living, living, living love   Love is needing to be loved..Cover up your face with soap, there,   Now you're Santa Claus..I want to live!"

"Have you ever watched or seen a book or even a movie that you do not think kids should be reading or watching? I have, heard of many books. There are even music out there that only adults should be listening too. There are some parents that are strick on what their kids watch, hear, read or sing. I know for a fact that my parents would not want me to be letting my childern read, watch or hear that kind of stuff.      When you think of the music, books, or movies that need to be out of childern reach what should they be? I think the movies, books and even music that have bad language, violence, and bullying need to be hidden from childern. Bad language is not apporaite from kids to be hearing when they are under the age of ten or even older. When you hear a bad song coming on when you have little kids near you, you should turn the station to a differnet station. If little kids hear this kind of language they well be saying it when the are young.     Another book, song or music that should be taken off the shelf should be ones that have violence. If kids watch, hear or read about violence, they are most likely to start being violent when they start hearing or reading about it. When you are walking around you, you should not be scared to walk by yourself with out getting attacked. If you see someone reading or watcing something that you do not think is right for them you should tell them not to be reading or watching that. Violence is bad for little kids to be doing when they are young.     Books, movies or music about bullying should be taken out of. Bullying is not the answer to everything, even though many think it is it is not. If you think it is good for little kids to be learning about bullying you are wrong! It is a bad thing for little kids. Bullying also gets you in trouble when you are caught doing the bullying.      Have you ever thought of a book that should be taken off the shelf? The books that I think that should be taken off the shelf would be the ones that have bad language, violence, and bullying. Childern should not be hearing or reading about bad language. They also should not be watcing anything about violence. Lastly they should not be reading anything about bullying.These verses are a chance to remembered and reprized..You have this way of dipping in and out of   Sight as things collide   Bridges burning

"Honestly there's alot of books and magagives that need to be taking off the self. I can remember in the sixth grade going to the schools library and picking up a book that not only told me wha weed was it told me how to grow it! Also alot of book refer to drug and sex now a days and  absolutly hate it! The last book I checked out, even though it is been a while sence ive checked one out, had enough referances to sex that i could honestly say I thought I was read a porn magazine.     Our schools really need to watch what they put onto there selfs. I mean come on sixth graders shouldnt even be able know what weed is! Let alone read about it in school! maybe that why kids get interested in drugs and achole at such an early age. The book I read didnt have any negative satments about the weed. what makes anyone think that a book like that would keep kids from doing drugs?     Like I said before alot of book in schools and pubic librarys have books that refer a lot to drugs and sex. They have books now in our library that tell you what the drugs are, what kind of high it'll give you. And were you can buy the crap to make them!     Ok I know im in highschool but you should have book that seem like pron magazines. The book i read have pictures of postions in it! it broke everything down into details! It even gave websites on the back of the book. And that my friends is not alright. Its just sad.     It is just starting to scare me about what kind of stuff my little brother and little sister could be reading. Doesn't it scare you? I know I dont want my siblings to be reading about drugs and sex in detail. Let alont them reading about it at all. just take the books off the schools and pubic librarys selfs. Hardly anyone will read them anyway. And if they do its by accident like mine incounters where.You ain't coming back..For the sword outwears its sheath,   And the soul outwears the breast,   And the heart must pause to breathe,   And love itself have rest..Mark:   I'm feeling so alone now tonight   Even though you're here by my side   Is there something on your mind   From the world you'd left behind      I feel as if the loved shared before   Doesn't want to be here no more   And if there's something on your mind   There's never been a better time   To tell me      Bryan:   Do you love me   Still wanting me   Like I need you, oh      All:   There came a crossing on the road   If only there were signs to show me   Which direction I should go   I live my life with no regrets   It hasn't caught up on me yet   But I never knew I was losing you      Nicky:   I wonder as you walk through the door   Are you gonna hurt me some more   Never took you for the kind   Who would play up on my mind      Bryan:   Tell me what are you looking for   I can't play your games anymore   And when there's something on my mind   I will always find the time   To tell you      I still love you   Still wanting you   How I need you, oh      All:   There came a crossing on the road   If only there were signs to show me   Which direction I should go   I live my life with no regrets   It hasn't caught up on me yet   Well I never knew I was losing you   Losing you      Bryan:   It's not for the first time   That someone else has hurt me   By faking it too long   Where did we go wrong, yeah      All:   There came a crossing on the road   If only there were signs to show me   Which direction I should go   I live my life with no regrets   It hasn't caught up on me yet   Well I never knew I was losing you      There came a crossing on the road   If only there were signs to show me   Which direction I should go   I live my life with no regrets   It hasn't caught up on me yet   Well I never knew I was losing you   Losing you.There's just too many people now   And too little land   Too much rage and desire   It makes you feel so feeble now   It's so out of hand-   Big bombs and barbed wire...

"Censorship in libraries is not necassary. No reading material should be taken off the shelf. Every book has a different experience that can help a child learn. If the gurdain of a child believes that a certain book is bad or offensive; then the gurdian can forbid the child to read it. If people began to take away options on reading materials some kids @MONTH1 refuse to read at all. Every person is different and likes an option to pick a book that they can get in to. Censoring books at a library is pointless, you take away options, and the experience to learn from certain books.     Every book has a different plot and a different moral. Each story in its own way teaches the reader a moral. When you start to remove books from libraries you are taking away the chance for a student to learn a certain moral from that book. You are sort of in a way trying to hide away reality when taking away certain books. No book should ever be taken off the shelves of libraries. Every book removed from the shelves  is another learning experience taken away.     If there is a book that a child's gurdian disapproves of; keep it up to them to forbid their child not to read it. A book is simply a way to learn and explore the different things in life. Censoring at the library can only keep kids away from the books for so long. Every child deserves the chance to read any book they wnat, unless a gurdian forbids. It is not up to libraries wether a book is offensive or bad. That is soley based on the readers opinion, and everyones opinion is different. So again, if a gurdian really wants their child to stay away from certain reading material they can forbid their child by theirselves.     When libraries begin to censor books they take away the option to pick books. When you limit the themes of books in your library, some kids @MONTH1 just pick up less and less books as time goes by. Everyone enjoys a differnet kind of book, leaving options open gives everyone the chance to find a book they like. Although some stories @MONTH1 seem like a bad option, it is not until the reader has begun to read that he or she can figure that out. Leaving options open for students is the best idea, because more kids @MONTH1 actually read.     All in all libraries should not censor books or any kind of reading material. Everyone is different even when it comes to reading a book. People like their options to be open and at a wide range. Each book tells a differnt story and teaches a different moral. So leave the options open to the children and let them learn from the stories they choose. Some books helps teach a moral or get a point acoss. Also some books help prepare a person for the outside world. Taking away certain reading materials is taking away the chance for a child to learn the things that are actually going on around them. In conclusion censorship is a bad idea and should be left to the gurdian of a child.Floating in a pool of mud   Try to get back where I was and I don't really care   Got a little talking to, by the

" The censorship in libraries should be as gog as it is for that age group. Children of the age @NUM1 to @NUM2 should be able to read books with any profanity. they should be mature enough to get through a book that has name calling and uses the profanity without laughing or taking it offensive.     Children that are @NUM3 should not have books in their libraries with much of this pro-found languge. They are young and should not be expecting the fact that there people that use these words to express feeling or name calling. They should be able to hear very little or see very little but when they get older they are suppose to be use to this. If they dont hear it as much then yes i would agree but they should have a point of censorship in the libraries they are in.      With children that are younger than @NUM4 years of age they should not read or seee things that have profanity or bad scenes unless their parents let them. We cannot controll what parents lets their children do but we can in the schools and in the public libraries.Got my mind made up..And i reach out in the air,   And i call out your name and you're always there,   Then you send down your light,   Then you tell me, walk by faith not by sight,   And then you come shining down..We are the children of a new regime   We are the children of a new machine..Mr Black: Tell the world that we finally did it,   Made a man that's totally programmed,   Preconditioned thoughts and emotions,      Push-button artificial man..What's out of place when you look into the mirror?.We know these quarries in our sleep   And where they're cold and where they're deep..Let's go   Say one, two, three, four      I oversee the world   You taught many of 'em, many dudes   I'm moldin' rappers and showed 'em how to eat   Chef, the senator of thoughts   Democratic gats   Saved by the judge   The flavor, that was brought about that day   Steaks come out, raw      Say oh!.Guest Artists:   George Hawkins, Jr. - Bass   Chris Thompson - Background Vocals.I need to find a place to hide   You never know what could be   Waiting outside   The accidents you could find   It's like some kind of suicide      So what ails you is what impales you   I feel like I've been crucified to be satisfied      I'm a victim of my symptom   I am my own worst enemy   You're a victim of your symptom   You are your own worst enemy   Know your enemy      I'm elated   Medicated   I am my own worst enemy   So what ails you is what impales you   You are your own worst enemy   You're a victim of the system   You are your own worst enemy   You're a victim of the system   You are your own worst enemy.Chorus:   Kailan kita muling makikita   Sa bahay namin ba ikaw ay pupunta   Ngunit hindi ko na nabanggit kung saan ba   Kailan nga ba magbabalik ka   Kailan nga ba   Kailan nga ba.Say something, say something else   Say something, say something else   Say something, say something else.[Chorus]   No matter what you make   All that you can take   Is what you give away   What you give away      There's people on the street   Ain't got enough to eat   You just shake your head   The measure of a man is one who lends a hand   That's what my father said      After you've counted everything you saved   Do you ever hit your knees and pray?.And just when I think   That things are in their place,   The heavens are secure,   The whole thing explodes in my face!.In every song he sang, I played the part..Now don't put me on,   What's gonna happen to me when you're gone   How will I live,   How can I go on   How can I go on   Hey girl!.Please get away from me..Let them reach up to the clouds..To stop the clock..(instrumental intro)   Going to jamaica,   Warm and coral waters flow   There she goes   Sun kissed her body, in this magic feel love grow,   Love grows   Feel like letting go   Hey mr.

"Hi my name is @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @PERSON1 and I'm here to talk about why I thing we should have these certain materials in the libraries.                       Why I think these materials should stay well because,  For @CAPS3 lets say its a certain movie or song or book or whatever just that one thing you were looking for, for ages and you couldn't find it in any other store and you just happening to go to the library just to look. Even though  you know its not there, but you just looking and you end up finding whatever it is you where looking for.             And what if you wanted to look for a myster book and only the library had that book you where looking for. I can think of alot of reasons why we need certain materials. well i guess that about sums that up for me.                 And in concultion put yourself in the same shoes or even my shoes. What would you do? would you let them remove those materials or would you fight for them to stay..But you don't know, you don't know what it's like,   No you don't, no, no, no, you don't know,

me to leave, how could I go?.Or was the mind grown accustomed   To hearing ""Good morning Dear""?.Fine, you're gonna be fine   You don't have to worry don't you turn and run, run run   Turn your face

Well according to some people it does which i can understand but i will have to go with the side that it does'nt matter to. Becasue its not like there not going to find out about bad language or sex so i say there should be no restrictions on books, music, movies, magazines, tv shows, ect.     The fact of the matter is that people or parents get to offended or complain cause there little @PERSON1 said a curse word in front of them. Or becasue some of the material in the show or magazines are to offensive towards people with disabilities, races, ect. When really all of this is just humor none of it is the network or authors being serious. Authors works arent to be shunned apon but to be read and for people to learn from that book or just have a good time reading it.     Through all of this you should know by now that i don't think that books should be taken off the shelf just becasue little kids parents are ashamed of what there kid read. Casue like i already said there are gonna find out about this stuff eventually. So no need getting mad over it. And if we got rid of all the more mature books what  kind of books would all of us more mature kids and people have to read. Casue im pretty sure i dont want to read about a magical friendly dragon finding its way home..She smokes a little home grown, drinks a little Cuervo..No I haven't heard your band   Because you guys

"Picture this: you come home one day after work and before you even enter the house, you hear music blaring from your child's room. As you step closer, you begin to hear the lyrics that go with the banging bass and you realize that that isn't just any music, it's completely unedited, expicit versions of vulgar songs. Now, who would want their child listening to songs that make it seem like drinking, doing drugs, and other various risky activities are okay? I know I sure wouldn't.     Music isn't the only source of offensive material in today's society. It can be found nearly anywhere. In books, magazines, @CAPS1 shows, movies, on the @CAPS2, you name it. All of these are easily accessible by children of all ages. That is why there should be censorship of certain materials, to a certain degree. By this, I mean that if there is a dirty book in a public library, it should only be able to be rented by people who are of a certain age. Just because it's bad doesn't mean that it has to completely vanish from the face of the world. There should just be a limitation on who can view it. That applies to everything that could contain offensive material.      Kids are kids. There are certain things that should be absolutely off limits to them--such as explicit movies, books, music, etc.--as they do not need to know about drugs, sex, or alcohol at such a young age. Censorship should definitely be in effect in places like public libraries where young children are bound to be. But, as mentioned earlier, censorship should only be to a certain degree. Keeping childrens' minds clean for as long as possible would be a very positive thing to do for both them and our society in general.please someone help me   It's not healthy... for me to feel this way   Y.O.U..I've got a new complaint   Forever in debt to your priceless advice   Hey!.Please forgive this platitude   But I like your attitude   You are just the kind I've had in mind,   Never could find      Honey, I'm so keen on you   I could come to lean on you   On a random bay   Give you your way      Do what you say   Gee, it's all fine and dandy   Sugar candy,   When I've got you      Then I only see the sunny side   Even trouble has its funny side   When you're gone, my sugar candy   I get so lonesome, I get so blue      But when you're handy   It's fine and dandy   But when you're gone   What can I do?.Let's light our Christmas trees   For a bright tomorrow   Where nations are at peace   And all are one in God      Let's sing Merry Christmas   And a happy holiday,   This season may we never forget   The love we have for Jesus   Let Him be the One to guide us   As another new year starts   And may the spirit of Christmas   Be always in our hearts....

"Should books, magazines, movies, and music be put in higher reaches of children, or should they be left in plain sight? Is @CAPS5 fair to not be capable to see a movie, magazine, or even read a book because others in the area believe @CAPS5's offensive in their view? If an adult is reading a specific book or magazine and they feel @CAPS5's only for their eyes to see @CAPS5 then they should keep that item in a personal place that only he or she knows, not anyone else.      Books and magazines should not be removed from shelves if they are found offensive. The reason for this is because, @CAPS5's not fair to others who haven't read them, and who would like to read them, but can't because they have been removed to others oppinions. If the books and magazines weren't appropriate for children then the companies wouldn't print them and releasr them to stands for them to be sold. If certain music also wasn't appropriate then music producers wouldn't let artists release that song out on a track.     There are many chances for school projects that @MONTH1 require getting information, but the student who is assigned to get @CAPS5 is not able to, due to the fact that adults think the website @MONTH1 be inappropriate. For example, in history class a student is assigned an assignment to get done over the @DATE2 about @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 for a grade. @DATE3 comes and he/she doesn't have @CAPS5 and gets a @CAPS4 for the homework he/she was assigned. The student explains why he/she wasn't able to get any information. He/she starts explaing themself by saying 'the websites I went to were blocked. The books and magazines I tried checking out were either thrown out, or I wasn't able to check them out.' '@CAPS5's all because our neighbors who live in this neighborhood think the pictures and words are offensive, and since then the librarians stopped putting them out on shelves.'      The teacher then says, 'well then I will go and sign out a book for you and you can try and get as much information out as you can, how does that sound to you?' '@CAPS6 good, at least @CAPS5's better then getting an @CAPS4 on the assignment,' said the student. @DATE1 @TIME1 comes, adn the student has as much information he/she was able to get out of the two books, and hands @CAPS5 to the teacher. At the end of class @CAPS5 gets graded and the grade on @CAPS5 turns out to be a @CAPS8. Student is happy for picking up the grade but is still unhappy he/she wasn't able to get the items they needed from the start.     This is why movies, books, magazines, or even music should not be removed from shelves. Things like this will probably happen, and the kids will land up getting in trouble for not having the assignment turned in which is not even their fault. If only a few citizens have oppinions about certain items and they feel that those items should be removed, then they should be from their sight, and they shouldn't bother thinking of them. Even if @CAPS5's for safety of the children they @MONTH1 have in the house with them, then they shouldn't even have the books out of the little private personal spot where nobody knows of excpet for that one particular person..Where would I be without my woman?.But a moment isn't very long..Hanging like Jesus on the cross..Yeah, I'm kinda fonda Wanda..I can show you a, good time,   Do you wanna have fun, fun, fun?.but I know the difference,   Between myself and my reflection..Well I'm gonna love you darling   If it takes me all night and day..Dig down deep, to buy the bonds that buy the tanks,   Palmers for our fighting yanks, dig down deep..Retaliation for this one won't be minimal   'Cause I'm a criminal   Way before the rap shit      Bust the gat shit   Puff won't even know what happened,   If it's done smoothly   Silencers on the Uzi      Stash in the hooptie   My alibi, any cutie   With a booty that don't fuck the Pop   Head spinnin, reminiscin bout my man see-Rock      [Chorus: x 2]   Somebody's gotta die   If I got, you gotta go   Somebody's gotta die   Let the gunshots blow   Somebody's gotta die   Nobody gotta know   That I killed yo ass in the mist, kid      Fillin' clips he explained our situation   Precisely, so we know exactly what we facin   Some kid named Jason   In a highway station, raggin      Was braggin   About how much loot and crack he stackin   Rock had a grip so they formed up a clique   Small crew      'Round the time I was locked up with you   True indeed   But yo nigga let me proceed   Don't fill them clips too high      Give them bullets room to breathe   Damn where was I?.There is a house in New Orleans   They call the Rising Sun   And it's been the ruin of many a poor boy   And God, I know I'm one..In case of fire,   Break the glass, (fuck)   And move on into your own....You see the dying, you feel the pain   What have you got to say   If we agree that we can disagree   We could stop all of this today      It's been your life for as long as you can remember   But you cannot fight no more   You must want to look your son in the eyes   When he asks you what you did it for      'Cos all day long he was fighting for you   And he didn't even know your name   Young men come and young men go   But life goes on just the same      I don't know why....And why did you give me so much love in a loveless world,   When there is no one I can turn to   To unlock all this love?.I'm glad I opened your eyes   The have-nots would have tried to freeze you in ice      Have you seen your brother, baby, standing in the shadow?.How y'all feelin' tonight?.Care to sit down, let's talk it out   One on one, without a crowd   I wanna hold your hand   Make you laugh again, I need to be near you   Gotta let you know, how I'm feeling   Own my heart, and she just renting   Don't turn away, pay attention   I'm pouring out my heart girl      I-I, I'm not living life   I'm not living right   I'm not living if you're not by my side   Ooh oh      I-I, I'm not living life   I'm not living right   I'm not living if you're not by my side   Ooh oh      I can't eat I-I-I-I   I can't sleep I-I-I-I   What I need I-I-I-I   Is you right by my side ah      I can't eat I-I-I-I   I can't sleep I-I-I-I   What I need I-I-I-I   Is you right by my side ah      It ain't your spit game, it's your dick game   That got me walking 'round ready to wear your big chain   I only argue wit' 'em when the Lakers on   Other than that I'm getting my Marc Jacob's on   When my pussy game so cold that he always seem to come back   'Cause he know that it'd be a wrap   When I'm riding it from the back   Wait, oh, let me see your phone   'Cause all them bitches is ratchet   And let me get in my truck   'Cause all them' bitches'll catch it   Wait wait wait, there I go again   I be trippin', I be flippin', I be so belligerent   Man this shit that we be fighting over so irrelevant   I don't even remember though I was probably hella bent, let's go      I-I, I'm not living life   I'm not living right   I'm not living if you're not by my side   Ooh oh      I-I, I'm not living life   I'm not living right   I'm not living if you're not by my side   Ooh oh      I-I ooh oh   I-I ooh oh   I-I ooh oh   If you're not by my side      I can't eat I-I-I-I   I can't sleep I-I-I-I   What I need I-I-I-I   Is you right by my side ah.Well, the heart she gave me   Wasn't made of stone..Went back home again   This sucks gotta pack up and leave again   Say goodbye to all my friends   Can't say when I'll be there again   It's time now to turn around   Turn my back on   Everything (turn my back on) everything....

"Do you believe that certian materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive? No, no i do not. it is one thing to censor a book or movie, but to completley remove it is another. I feel like authors, artists, musicians, and writers should have the freedom to write and say what they want. Regardless of who is reading it.     I feel like censorship is wrong. Authors should be able to feel free to express there thoughts and feelings about a subject or topic in any way they like. some times storys cannot be explained or told the way it needs to be without certain words. Wether those words be good or bad i feel like with out them the book that is being read is not all of what it could of been. in my oppionion censorship takes away from certain values or qualitys the book could of had with the original context still in it. and to me that is not fair. its not fair to the author. and is most certainly not fair to the reader who is reading the book.     I know from my personal expierences with reading books that 'yes' i have read books that have had bad language in them. but just because a book has one or two bad words in it does not mean that it should be completley taken off the shelf. For example the book '@CAPS1' @CAPS2: @PERSON1 was an amazing book. I probably enjoyed that book more than i have any other book that i have ever read in my entire life. But that book would not be nearly as good as it was with it being scensored or taken off the shelf for that matter.     All i am trying to get at is that good books with bad language should not be censored just because of some of the words it has in it. because that is getting away from what the over all message is about. Your almost taking the words out of context when you do this. Do i believe that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelf if they are found offensive? No i do not. Neither should you.Damn      [Hook]   And I ain't never did this before, no (x8)      [Verse 2]   I wrote back and said, ""Of course I had sex before,"" knowing I was frontin'   I said, ""I'm like a pro, baby,"" knowing I was stuntin'   But if I told the truth I knew I'd get played out, son   Hadn't been in pussy since the day I came out one   But, she don't know that, so she done wrote back and told me   ""Oh you a pro homie?.Richie: ""Don't hang up!"".Everyday- it's for the Mom..Children will want them,   Mothers supply them,   As long as your killers are heroes..One pill makes you larger   And one pill makes you small   And the ones that mother gives you   Don't do anything at all   Go ask Alice   When she's ten feet tall      And if you go chasing rabbits   And you know you're going to fall   Tell 'em a hookah smoking caterpillar   Has given you the call   Call Alice   When she was just small      When men on the chessboard   Get up and tell you where to go   And you've just had some kind of mushroom   And your mind is moving low   Go ask Alice   I think she'll know      When logic and proportion   Have fallen sloppy dead   And the White Knight is talking backwards   And the Red Queen's ""off with her head!"".The rain doesn't fall on me any more   The sun doesn't feel as warm as before   Stars seem far away and fading from sight   All the beautiful things in my life   They're all gone, all gone, all gone now      Close talks, long walks taken with friends   Getting dirty playing with the neighborhood kids   Waking up early to see the sun rise   All the meaningful things in my life   They're all gone, all gone, all gone now      Song birds, summer words in my ear   The fingers of the wind brushing my hair   The mold on the leaves as they die each year   The magical things in my life   They're all gone, all gone, all gone now.Try it again..See ya later - see ya later   Hip-a-no-no-no-no   Hip-a-no-no-no-no   See ya later - call me      We dance underneath the radar   We live underneath the bomb   When you live underneath the radar   There's no way that you're ever gonna get far   (So get hip!).Sheer heart attack, Sheer heart attack   Real cardiac.I'm not yours for better but for worse,   And I've learned to give the well-known witches' curse..Do I know her face?.I know those bright lights are callin' ya, honey..Shout him down, it's worth it,   No compromises on this..Anyway, I gotta do him in..Say, my love, I came to you with best intentions   You laid down and gave to me just what I'm seeking   Love, you drive me to distraction      Hey my love do you believe that we might last a thousand years   Or more if not for this,   Our flesh and blood   It ties you and me right up   Tie me down      Celebrate we will   Because life is short but sweet for certain   We're climbing two by two   To be sure these days continue   These things we cannot change      Hey, my love, you came to me like wine comes to this mouth   Grown tired of water all the time   You quench my heart and you quench my mind      Celebrate we will   Because life is short but   Sweet for certain   We're climbing two by two   To be sure these days continue   The things we cannot   Celebrate, you and me, climbing two by two, to be sure   These days continue, things we cannot change      Oh, my love I came to you   With best intentions   You laid down and gave to me   Just what I'm seeking      Celebrate we will   Because life is short   But sweet for certain   We're climbing two by two   To be sure these days continue   Things we cannot change....What?.It's still the same old story   A fight for love and glory   A case of do or die..I thought I couldn'T live without you here with me   Guess I was just A fool I was too blind to see   Now I ain'T gonna make the same mistakes again   Oh I can'T believe how hard it is for you to understand   That to love me   You gotta be true you'Ve gotta be true   You'Ve got to know just what to say   (can'T tell you what to do)   You wouldn'T make me cry   Wouldn'T hurt me this way   It really is easy to love me   I remember when we used to talk (used to talk, and...)

"Sexual conduct, language, and criminal behavior are three big things in my school, and community. Certain books, movies, music, and magazines are all about those three things. If they are in our libraries, how can teachers and administration keep us from it during school? I think the censorship of some movies, magazines, and especially music should be highly discussed, and more strict.     We do not really have a lot of movies in our school library, but I do know that there are some in the town library. Parents and adults do not want us growing up so fast, and yet they allow sexual, crude language movies to be on the shelves of libraries. If it is such a big deal, I think they need to be removed. I'm a big believer on the fact that if it happens, it is going to happen no matter @CAPS1 precautions are taken. But with that said, we can still take the needed precautions to keep it from kids that are too yound to see them, like under the age of @NUM1. It is not just movies that we have to worry about though.     @ORGANIZATION1 is a magazine that is devoted to giving their readers tips on sex, problems with their sex lives, and the occassional '@CAPS1 to wear this @DATE1!' articles. I will say that I have read this magazine, but it doesn't appeal to my interests. Some kids today though, are very attentive to those subjects. Again, that goes back to the problem of kids growing up too fast. I have noticed in my school alone, that it is a rapidly growing problem. If magazines like this weren't on the shelves for us to see whenever we enter a library, maybe we would not be as keen to the idea. If we were not introduced to it so early, we would not be going behind our parents' backs trying to do it. @ORGANIZATION1, and other magazines like it, needs to be taken off the shelves as soon as possible. Music is a world-wide phenomenon.     Say a child around the age of @NUM2 is listening to the new @CAPS2' @PERSON1 song. He is being introduces to crude language, sexual behavior, and criminal acts in the @NUM3 minute time period it takes to listen to the full song. Seriously, it only takes that long for a child to be introduced, and it is only one song out of the thousands that are out there. This music is able to be accessed on many computers, especially in public, town libraries. We are not allowed to act like that in school, and if we are going to be spending @NUM4 of our childhood/teenage years here, why let us listen to it? If you walk into a library, all you have to do is sign your name, the date, and the time you got there to access a computer. After that, they can not tell you to get off of it, unless you are violating the law or looking up something not age appropriate. Music does not fall into that category. It, too needs to be taken away if the language, sexual conduct, and criminal behavior messages are adult rated.     I, personally, love magazines, movies, and music. They are my three m's and I live by them. But not the ones that are going to get me in trouble, put wrong messages in my head, or cause me (subconciously) do participate in a criminal act. I always allow my mother or father to read books, listen to music, and watch movies with me. If they are not pleased with @CAPS1 it is, I will not do it behind their back. The censorship in libraries needs to be more strict. If it were more strict, it would keep our younger children from growing up to fast and keep teens from participating in criminal acts. The censorship in libraries is an ongoing problem and it needs to be fixed..I will never cease..Two hundred miles to go..I don't love you..You're in the way   Of all that I believe in..But try as she may,   In her voice there's a flaw!.And it's so uneasying to think you are with me all the time..Lord my body has been a good friend   But I won't need it when I reach the end      Miles from nowhere   I guess I'll take my time   Oh yeah, to reach there      I creep through the valleys   And I grope through the woods   'Cause I know when I find it my honey   It's gonna make me feel good, yes      I love everything   So don't it make you feel sad   'Cause I'll drink to you, my baby   I'll think to that, I'll think to that..Do you want to hear something sad?.To be sung of a summer night on the water   Ooh, on the water..Now it's time to say goodnight   Goodnight, sleep tight   Now the sun turns out his light   Goodnight, sleep tight   Dream sweet dreams for me..Oh-uh-oh, oooh..No trace of resentment, no trace of regrets,   One blood's thinner but both look red and fresh..Oh no!.Here comes that rainy day feeling again   Writers roger cook, roger greenaway      Here comes that rainy day feeling again   And soon my tears they will be falling like rain   It always seems to be a Monday   Left over memories of Sunday   Always spent with you before the clouds appear   And took away my sunshine   Here comes that rainy day feeling again   And I'll be dreaming of you baby in vain   Your face is always on my mind girl   I hope that soon you're gonna find girl   Your way back to me   Cause if you say you'll stay, the rainy days would go away   Misty morning eyes I'm trying to disguise the way I feel   But I just can't hide it   People seem to know   The loneliness will show   I'm thinking of my pride but breaking up inside girl...

"Censorship in Libraries     @CAPS1 are alot of things on the library shelves that you @MONTH1 be concerned about. You @MONTH1 be wondering why they don't take the bad stuff off the library shelves. On the library shelves it contains books, music, movies, and magazines. Some things are like what pictures it contains, launguage it contains, and what kind of advertising.     Some things I have expierenced is with the launguage it contains. I have seen some books, magazines, music, and movies have are cusswords. Also some @MONTH1 have racism things in it that you don't like. Another thing is that @CAPS1 is some bad persuading such as bad things that you hear or see and you wonder what it would be like to do that stuff.     Also another thing are advertisements. Some things a magazine can contain are about advertising tobacco, such as its good for you to try. Other ads are alcohol ads like a picture of someone with a beer or whiskey in @CAPS1 hand, and we think its cool to try it, but its not. The last thing that is really bad in advertisement is drug advertisement, such as a picture of a drug leaf, or inscents. It is bad to do drugs because it can ruin you whole career in high school and maybe in college.     The last thing are pictures and scenes. In movies, @CAPS1 could be scenes that you don't approve of. In some magazines @CAPS1 can be pictures in which you don't approve in either. So things that I have seen are pictures and scenes in movies and magazines that have innapropiate scenes, and innapropiate pictures.     Some things are like what pictures it contains, launguage it contains, and what kind of advertising @CAPS1 is. On the library shelves it contains books, music, movies, and magazines. You @MONTH1 be wondering why they don't take the bad stuff off the library shelves. @CAPS1 are alot of things on the library shelves that you @MONTH1 be concerned about..My friends are all dead now

"Everyone today gets offeneded daily. So to go to a library and see offensive material on the shelfs is no different than the rest of the day. However, there are those minds, which have not been poluted and influenced by these offensive materials, that should have a right to keep thier minds that way.      One solution to the problem could be that we start rating books and magazines like we do for movies. The material rated for adults gets put in one area of the lirary while the lower rated material is put on display for the public. The higher rated can be put in an area that is not seen everyday by the public, and is kept secret thus protecting the uninfluenced minds and the people wanting said material can still have their way.     Another solution might be to just get rid of the censored material. It, in my opinion and experience, corrupts both the mind and soul, and causes man to be things he is not by nature. Men, who have nothing better to do than to sit and read or look at things ment for inside of marrage, often accoplish nothing of great value in their life time. They are thus a hinderence to soceity. But if they can not accsess the material, they then need something to do to fill that time. In which case they can find a good classic to read or maybe pick up that dusty @CAPS1 off the shelf.     This thus leaves the labraries with a choice. They can leave their library the way that they want, they can put the offensive material in a seclueded room, or they can remove definent offensive material and keep soceity on its feet accomplishing great feats for the next generation to odserve. Thus the amount of offending someone goes down and maybe the library attendence goes up..Beau James, Beau James, Beau James.Like I long from you baby..If you are my saviour   Then I'm dead and no one can help me..Load the box and then pump that shit..Shut up!.Nothing left for me to tell you   Nothing left   Oh well, oh well, oh well   Oh well   Oh well, oh well, oh well   Oh well.Anneliese (speaking)-   I love Madame Carp's dresses!.Waste a' time, waste a' prime time..Sun going up,   Making its rounds   It keeps on moving,   Painting the town   Before you know it,   She's sinking low   So tell me something ..shoes   And if I don't go stateside soon   I'm gonna blow my fuse      Occupation G.I..But if you get too burnt, you can't come back home   And as I was standing by the edge   I could see the faces of those led pissing themselves laughing   (And the flames grew)   Their mad eyes bulged their flushed faces said   The weak get crushed as the strong grow stronger   We feast on flesh and drink on blood   Live by fear and despise love in a crises   (What with today's high prices)   Bring some paper and bring some wood   Bring what's left of all your love for the fire   We'll watch the flames grow higher!.(What is the law?).She was gentle, she was charmin'   And I heard him call her ""darlin'   He was graceful as a whisper   On his delicate legs of silver      And the rats and worms were still as mice   And the poor old pigeon said ""That's nice""   As shimmering there, ah, the lovely bride   As they danced to the reel in the flickering light   Oh round we go, heel to the toe   As shimmering there, ah, the lovely bride   As they danced to the reel in the flickering light      Oh round we go, heel to the toe   As shimmering there, ah, the lovely bride   As they danced to the reel in the flickering light.Can you feel it?.Oh, I wanted to be a star   Is life good to you or is it bad?.Ev'rything's gonna be alright now..Easy breezy   When you wrestle you know that you hurt somebody   How do I breathe?.This tattered document   A mystery you can solve   Some burnt out filament   Flies buzzing around the bulb      Country darkness      He thought of traveling   Heard an approaching train   Drown out his desperate pulse   A song with no refrain      Country darkness      She daydreams forbidden sings   There must be something more   The prison she lives in   The one with the open door      Country darkness      The veil is covering   A glistening and cruel blade   Suffer little children   Repent, unfaithful maid      Country darkness.I'm having a hard time, living the good life, well I know..Talk to me, don't be shy,   Heaven knows I really try to love you..Just a minute of your time   Yes I've been known to delude myself   So let me put those rose   Colored glasses to the test      Now is this real enough for you   Cause blonds here don't jump out of cakes   If that never impressed you much      Come board this lunatic express      Just why do they say   Have a nice day anyway   We both know they wouldn't mind      If I just curled up and died   Let's not give that one a try   Chin up put on a pair of these roseys   Raise those blinds   Chin up a happy mask was never   Your best disguise   Chin up put on a pair of these roseys   In no time you will feel almost fine      Almost rosey      Now some girls here will huddle with   No not footballers that are rich   But will confide in small white sticks   He bats as The Virginian Slim      Then I tried once to comply   With an authority that would   Subsidize my wild side   But at this altar was sacrificed      Yes you can laugh a femme fatale   In a bride's dress now married to   The effortlessness of the cracks   That lie now in between the facts      Now about when violet died   The cause still unidentified   She thought her love would be enough   But you can't seduce seduction      Her tentacles of endless want   Reach through my corridors   And tempt me to taste of her power   I sober with the witching hour      And when I hear of one more bomb   Yes we have all been robbed of song   And nightingales who throw their arms up   When is enough enough?.When will you win?"
" Hi my name is @PERSON1 I have a couple topics that I would       like to talk to you about. I have been hearing alot of people          talking about libraries taking alot of there stuff off the shelves      well I think that that the libraries around the world have alot        of information inside of them and if we started taking                  information out of them then what would be the point in              having them. I think that everything in libraries are very               important and who is to know that everybody wants this to          happen. The one thing that I dont really think that libraries           need in them is movies because like pretty much every movie      has a book that goes with it or is the same thing pretty much.       And lets get on with the whole offensive thing I think everone      should be mature about all the negative stuff people can say         even if it is hurtfull. Though I think that the more people read      about what people are saying about them is the less that              they are goin to care because they are goin to just be so used       to it that they are not even goin to know what they are                talking about. If there was one thing that I could tel the world      it would be dont be offened by what people say to you..I'm as free as a bird now   As flighty as a Bumble Bee   I'm here today and gone tomorrow   Foot loose child and fancy free   I'm absolutely independent   Nothin' at all is gonna worry me   I believe I was born to travel   The open road is gonna bring me close   You come to know some way-out people   To say the least, I dig the most   Who live and love across both borders   Trip, East and West from coast to coast   I only have one cradle to rock now   I'm gonna rock it everywhere I go   From St. Louis to San Francisco   Ah!.Out here in the country where the weather gets so mean   She thinks about the places that she ain't never seen   She knows that she's married but she can't remember why   And she wonders what it might feel like with some other guy      And though she's hotter than an oven   Just to fill your lovin' cup   If a man answers, you better hang up      You better hang up   You better hang up   You better hang up   You better hang up      You're from New York City where they don't say no prayers   Anything goes and nobody cares   And the country girl might thrill ya but you better pass her by   'Cause her ol' man love to kill ya for the look that's in your eye      And though you're hotter than an oven   Just to fill her lovin' cup   If a man answers, you better hang up      You better hang up   You better hang up   You better hang up   You better hang up   You better hang up   You better hang up   You better hang up   You better hang up.The microphone explodes, shattering the molds   Either drop tha hits like de la O or get tha fuck off tha commode   Wit tha sure shot, sure ta make tha bodies drop   Drop an don't copy yo, don't call this a co-op   Terror rains drenchin', quenchin' tha thirst of tha power dons   That five sided fist-a-gon   Tha rotten sore on tha face of mother earth gets bigger   Tha triggers cold empty ya purse      Rally round tha family!.You hold my every moment   You calm my raging seas   You walk with me through fire   And heal all my disease      I trust in You   I trust in You      I believe You're my Healer   I believe You are all I need   I believe You're my Portion   I believe You're more than enough for me   Jesus You're all I need      My Healer, You're my Healer      Nothing is impossible for You   Nothing is impossible for You   Nothing is impossible for You   You hold my world in Your hands.No one cares   Nobody's wrong,   No one see   I'm not so strong..Put your left foot up!.Hey when that look is in your eyes   I can see my fate   Yes I see my fate      Hey when that look is in your eyes   I can see my fate   Yes I see my fate   Hey got the sun up in the sky   But it comes too late   Yes it comes too late      I'm like a dog   When I come crawlin' back-to-you   Crawlin' back-to-you   You want to play God   I can see it in your eyes   See it in your eyes   Huh!.Porkchops!.One, two, three...

"I believe that libraries should provide any kind of book, magazine, music, and movies to the public, despite if they are found offensive.  First, to support my position, we need to take into consideration that every person is different, and therefore reads and prefers different types of books and magazines.  The same thing applies for watching movies and listening to music.  Second, what @MONTH1 seem 'offensive' to one person @MONTH1 be perfectly fine for another, so the term 'offensive' is ambiguous in this case.  There is no need for an angry public or strikes.  Finally, I believe that the people have a free choice when choosing the types of books and magazines to be read, the types of movies to be watched, and the types of music to be listened to.  After all, it is for their own benefit, entertainment, and learning.  So, libraries should not have anything offensive removed from thier shelves that are found offensive.     First, we need to take into consideration that every person is different, and therefore prefers different types of materials provided by a library.  For example, one person @MONTH1 like to read philosophical books, and the other @MONTH1 like to read romance comedy books.  If the philosophical books were to be taken off the shelves by the library officials, then the person who likes philosophy will not have anything to read.  Yes, there are magazines available and movies to watch about philosophy, but they are experienced and learned differently than reading  @ORGANIZATION2's book, or @ORGANIZATION3's @CAPS1.  I had an experience similar to this with my friend.  She preferred horror movies, and I historical.  The horror movie she was looking for was not in the library, and later it turned out that the library did not have any kind of horror movie because they weren't popular in that city.  My friend was not happy.  The library had historical movies, but I ended up watching that by myself. So, libraries should not have to take away any sort of material that might be offensive to the public.     Second, the term 'offensive' in this case is ambiguous, meaning that it has multiple meanings.  What @MONTH1 seem 'offensive' to one person @MONTH1 not seem offensive to another.  An example:  a @CAPS2 @CAPS3 magazine cover @MONTH1 be offensive to a child because of the picture and 'adult' words for the child.  However, that same cover @MONTH1 be interesting to a young adult because he @MONTH1 be into surfing, suntanning, or @CAPS2.  Offensive is only used in the first part, but not in the second, and the same material was used.  So, should that magazine be removed? I don't think so.  The solution is for the child to look at @CAPS4 Magazines, @ORGANIZATION1, or @CAPS5 magazines.  The library should provide a section for @ORGANIZATION1 so that they can read appropriate material.     Finally, I believe that the peole have a free choice when choosing the books to read, the type of movies to watch, and the types of music to listen to.  They should be allowed to do this because of their differences and their definition of 'offensive'. People should not be forced to read the same type of book, to watch the same type of movies, or to listen to the same type of music.  They should have a choice of choosing the materials provided by the library which corresponds to their personalities.  After all, the materials they see, read, or listen to is for their own benefit, their own learning, and for their own entertainment.  The main goal is for them to be happy with what the library has to offer.     In conclusion, I belive that libraries should not take off any material from their shelves that are found offensive.  This is due to the different people, the ambiguous term for 'offensive', the for the sake of human flourishment.  Libraries are for studying, learning, and entertainment in a quiet, peaceful place.  They should not discourage people to discontinue learning about the world because that would lead to a bigger and more serious worldwide problem: the lack of education..You can't be too careful   And

"Many places show and sell offensive material. It is found almost everywhere. Many people try to shelter their kids from it but the truth is if the kids really want to look at it they are going to find a way. So I do not think all offensive material should be removed from shelves but sometimes things can offend more than one person in which case they @MONTH1 need to be removed.       Take music for example, there @MONTH1 be explicit lyrics in songs but that doesn't make them terrible or make them worth taking off the shelf. Music is everywhere and if someone tells you can't listen to it over a few words then they are going to find a way to listen to it.     Movies @MONTH1 be different. For some you do have to be a certain age and that is because of the offensive material. But still some people go see it anyways knowing that there will be offensive material in there but they go and see it and then complain about how offensive it was. Movies should not be pulled off the shelf because it is your choice if you want to watch it or not and if you choose not to there will always be someone who chooses to watch it.     Books @MONTH1 be the only exception. Many people read books and many do enjoy it but many people do find books offensive. Now with music and movies people know they aren't real its just talk or acting. But some books are written by people with the actual beliefs they write about. which is why some books might be pulled off shelves because if one person believes something it won't be hard to convince somebody else.       There is a big difference between choosing not to look or listen to something than being told you cannot look at something. All the things that show explicit material have some type of warning for it and if you choose to keep reading or listening it is your decision..Whenever I want you around, yeah   All I gotta do   Is call you on the phone   And you'll come running home, yeah   That's all I gotta do..It's been a long long time   Since I fell, fell   Love has found my way oh oh oh   I've been looking (looking)

"Censorship     In a library there are a plethora of books to choose from. Books ranging from children's to difficult adult ones. It's nice to know that you have many options and freedom to pick whatever book you would like to read. Censorship is the censoring of a piece of material so it is not legally or publically available. If a book was censored because of the contents inside it would bring into question other books or media related to it.     I believe that if books, magazines, movies, etc. were censored in a library the material wouldn't have a chance to be exposed to people. Some people write books and songs to express themselves or make money. If a book is taken out of a library other libraries will have to remove it also, and other libraries won't buy it. Some people just wish to get there thoughts out and share their message with other people. Censorship in a way stops the flow of what people learn.      Another part about censorship is where to draw the line on what is offensive enough to be censored. If a book is removed from the library for its contents, people will look into as to why it was removed. It gets people thinking as to what other books are also offensive. The reason why one book is removed could relate to another book and could get that one to be removed also. Since censorship is probably mostly opinion, there is no clear boundary as to what can sit on the shelf and what can't.     With censorship you are only stripping the freedom of press away from people. If a publishing company accepts a piece of media only to have is censored later on, this might mean we need new publishers, or that they are also interested in getting what people have to say out into the world. The boundary for censorship is very opinionated and should not be dictated by a single group. When one book is taken down it only brings other ones into question. Those are my beliefs about censorship in the library.Dim all the lights sweet darling   Cause tonight it's all the way   Turn up the old Victrola   Gonna dance the night away      Love just don't come

wackoes and weirdoes and dingbats and dodoes   And athletes and movie stars and David Allan Coe   There was leather and lace and every minority race   With a backstage pass to the Willie Nelson show   Kristofferson got an offer for a movie   Promoters closed another deal or two   Waylon got a call from his son Shooter   And he went home the minute he was through   I moved with the mob at intermission   To the green room where you see who you can see   There were has-been's and would-be's and never-were's   Paupers, punks and millionaires and me   And there were wackoes and weirdoes and dingbats and dodoes   And athletes and movie stars and David Allan Coe   There was leather and lace and every minority race   With a backstage pass to the Willie Nelson show   Hell's Angels blocked the traffic to the building   In order for the beer truck to come through   And waitin' in the wings to sing with Willie   Were hopeful stars of flickering magnitude   There was a singer Willie knew back in the fifties   Who once paid him fifty dollars for a song   There were women who once did and some who still would   I heard one ask, ""Did Connie come along?"".The end of your masquerade, a matter of time   Interwining lies, domination, control   Feed his twisted nature   It is sickening to see dreams die   A word of advice, fate's patience is growning short..Just like the

And he takes her to a schooner   And he treats her like a queen   Bearing beads from California   With their amber stones and green   He has called her from the harbor   He has kissed her with his freedom   He has heard her off to starboard   In the breaking and the breathing   Of the water weeds   While she was busy being free      There's a man who's climbed a mountain   And he's calling out her name   And he hopes her heart can hear three thousand miles   He calls again   He can think her there beside him   He can miss her just the same   He has missed her in the forest   While he showed her all the flowers   And the branches sang the chorus   As he climbed the scaley towers   Of a forest tree   While she was somewhere being free      There's a man who's sent a letter   And he's waiting for reply   He has asked her of her travels   Since the day they said goodbye   He writes ""Wish you were beside me   We can make it if we try""   He has seen her at the office   With her name on all his papers   Through the sharing of the profits   He will find it hard to shake her   From his memory   And she's so busy being free      There's a lady in the city   And she thinks she loves them all   There's the one who's thinking of her   There's the one who sometimes calls   There's the one who writes her letters   With his facts and figures scrawl   She has brought them to her senses   They have laughed inside her laughter   Now she rallies her defenses   For she fears that one will ask her   For eternity   And she's so busy being free      There's a man who sends her medals   He is bleeding from the war   There's a jouster and a jester and a man who owns a store   There's a drummer and a dreamer   And you know there may be more   She will love them when she sees them   They will lose her if they follow   And she only means to please them   And her heart is full and hollow   Like a cactus tree   While she's so busy being free.Check it, uhh   [Lil Kim] Crab ass

cliffs and under the many stars where   He will move, all amongst your tangled hair   And deep into the sea   And you will wake and walk and draw the blind   And feel some presence there behind   And

"Books, books, and more books. There are so many of these spine bound papers, filled with everything from basic @CAPS1 about life, all the way to stories that capture the minds of faithful readers and take them to far off distant worlds. If we were to take all the books in the world and line them up in a perfect row, we would be able to create a bridge of knowledge and iformation far enough to stretch around the moon twice and back. The problem is, that with all of this @CAPS1 and knowledge, there are young minds that are not yet ready to soak it all up. There is no such thing as bad @CAPS1. There is only people who are not yet ready for the @CAPS1 they are about to obtain. So should these materials that open up doors to new minds sets, and feelings such as books, music, magazines,  and movies be censored? That answer is yes.     First off, there is a certain degree of modesty and curiousity that needs to be kept in children. Children need to have a hunger for knowledge to become great learners, and intellegent minds. If the @CAPS1 given to them does not come in the chronological order of importance in which it needs to, this will poison there minds and twist them in to something they were not yet ready to become.     Secondly, @CAPS1 presented to kids to early can harm them physicaly. Children are born with the instict to repete what they observe. This is a primal instict that humans will forever have, and is essential for living life. So take movies for example. If a child watches movies that involve sexual themes, and actions, this can be very harmful to them physicaly. If a child experiences these things to soon, they will want to simply repete what they saw. Then what is next? The answer to that question is easy. There will be more teen mothers than there are needed.      Lastly, premature @CAPS1 can harm mentaly. Take music for example. Music is an even larger gateway to mental damage then movies are. This is simply a result of bad censorship. Many think that music is not as bad as movies because you can not see anything visually, but they are wrong. Music is even worse because children can picture what ever they want to based on what is being said in the lyrics. There needs to be tougher ristrictions on music. Restrictions such as age for purchase should be raised, That is about the only way that explicit content can be blocked.     In conclusion, there should be better censorship restrictions on certain materials. But I do not beleive that the materials that @MONTH1 be harmful or offensive should be remove as whole. Simply because adults do have the right to view these materials. Libraries around the world need to better there restrictions, even laws to stop poisoning the minds of our young. We people as a whole need to come together to make this happen. After all, the children are the future of our world.Lyin' in bed   The pain in my head   From running around all day   Tryin' to find what was rightfully mine   But I ran out of things to say      Runnin' around with strangers   Wishing she could run away with me..

"Censorship is a big controversy in modern society due to the fact of so many opinions being conveyed through all the new medias in the modern world. When a person has a veiw they tend to want to share it with the world or defend it againts those who opose their opinion. Some people do not always like what is being said or take offense in the way it is presented, thus causing the government, or any authority, to remove or replace these words, photos, lyrics, or film from a select public, such as children, or the entire public. This is censorship and it has caused many debates over what is acceptable in society's media.     I believe censorship is wrong. It violates the @CAPS1 peoples' rights of free speach. When a person has an opinion, they have the right to voice it anyway they want. The authorities should not be involved in what someone writes, sings, creates, etc., in anyway. Censorship takes away from the integrity and purity of a human's thoughts.     Who is to say what can and can't be said? Do we just let the government tell us what we can say and what is illegal? Do we stop expressing ourselves in the way we desire because it is not appropriate? No. We, as the people, must be free to say what we want in our stories and songs, along with movies and other media. If a person does not like what they see then they can turn away or they have the right to speak out against it in their own way; but they do not have the right to opress. They should write back, convey their message and try to win support, not control.     Censorship is not good for any society. People want to say whatever they want and they have the right to. Censorship is not a solution to discrimation or anger, it is only a fuel. If parents do not like something and do not want their children to experience it then do not take it from them, then they should tell them how it is 'wrong' and give them their opinion and reasons so the child @MONTH1 descide what they believe in on their own. An opinion is every human being's right and it belongs to them, not the authorities..When I say goodnight in your little room   Ah, that's the time I love you best of all   When I say goodnight in

"I do in deed believe that certain material should not be in public libraries, or places where young people can see it. Things, such as pornagraphic material should not be out in the open where kids can see it. I think we would all believe the same way when we say that kids do not need to be seeing these things.     I personaly have been in a movie rental shop, and seen some of the movies that my parents would not want me to see. Material such as this should be put away somewhere out of sight, and requested if wanted.     I also have a religious view on all of this. I know that it is a sin to look at the things such as porn and so the people in charge of the shop, or library ought to respect me and my religion. @PERSON1 in the @CAPS1 says that if eating meat causes his brother to stumble than he will not do so. We need to have the same aspect on life. If something causes someone else harm we should not do it.     This is an issue that we face every day, and the reason I am using pornagraphic material is because it is everywhere. If I am standing in the @ORGANIZATION1 check out line I see the people magazines and I find it verry offensive!     I will say though, if you are old enough to live by yourself than you can look at whatever you want. I just find it untollerable to post these materials were viewers who do not want to see them have to see them..What a lovely trip   I'm feeling so fresh and alive   And I'm so glad to arrive   It's all so grand      It's easy to see you don't need a palace   To feel like Alice in Wonderland   Back in Ohio where I come from   I've done a lot of dreamin' and I've travelled some      But I never thought I'd see the day   When I ever took a ride on the Santa Fe   (Wanna take a ride on the Santa Fe)   I would lean across my window sill      And hear the whistle echoin' across the hill   Then I'd watch the lights till they fade away   On the Atchison, Topeka and the Santa Fe   What a thrill (what a great big wonderful thrill)      With the wheels a-singin' ""westward ho""   Right from the day I heard them start   'Cross the Kansas plains from New Mexico   I guess I've got a little gypsy in my heart      When I'm old and grey and settled down   If I ever get a chance to sneak away from town   Then I'll spend my busman's holiday   On the Atchison, Topeka and the Santa Fe      All aboard!.But all that I say,   Can be told another way..I'll Take You Home Again, Kathleen   Across the ocean wild and wide   To where your heart has ever been   Since first you were my Bonnie bride..It feels so good   When we're lying next to each other,   Lost in love, lost in love,   Drifting along on a cloud of love..I want you to be true..Is there a vision   That I can call my own?.Didn't look it   Actually, it was a nice wake-me-up for my laticerace muscles   Water's pretty nice, huh?.Many people in the steeple   But no one leaves the walls   Quick to stand and speak all of their beliefs   Quick to leave you if you fall      Tell me where's the love   It knows no boundaries   Tell me where's the love, yeah, yeah   Open arms, we need to be open arms      Never judge You, always loving   Needs to be what we become   Lifting up the lost, showing them the cross   Shining brightly like the sun      Tell me where's the love   It knows no boundaries   Tell me where's the love, yeah, yeah   Open arms, we need to be open arms, yeah      Tell me where's the love   It knows no boundaries   Tell me where's the love, yeah, yeah   Open arms, we need to be open arms, oh yeah   And everybody sing      Open arms, we need to be open arms   And the whole world sing   Open arms, we need to be open arms.Please come to Boston   For the springtime   I'm stayin' here with some friends   And they've got lots of room   You can sell your paintings on the sidewalk   By a cafe where I hope to be workin' soon   Please come to Boston   She said no, boy you come home to me      Chorus:   (And) She said, hey ramblin' boy   Why don't you settle down   (Boston, Denver, L..Yesterday love was such an easy game to play..I can go the distance..Always asking questions   (why this why that?).First a little streak showed then slowly it wove it's way right in with the gold..One, two, a-one two three four      I've got every reason on earth to be mad, 'cause I just lost the only girl I had   If I could get my way, I'd get myself locked up today, but I can't, so I'll cry instead      I've got a chp on my shoulder that's bigger that my feet   I can't talk to people that I feet   If I could see you now, I'd try to make you sad somehow, but I can't, so I'll cry instead      Don't want to cry when there's people there, I get shy when they start to stare   I'm gonna hide myself away, hey, but I'll be back again someday      And when I do, you'd better hide all the girls   'Cause I'll be breaking hearts all around the world   Yes, I'm gonna break them in two and show you what your loving man can do   Until then, I'll cry instead      Oh I don't want to cry when there's people there, I get shy when they start to stare   I'm gonna hide myself away, hey, but I'll be back again someday      And when I do, you'd better hide all the girls   'Cause I'll be breaking hearts all around the world   Yes, I'm gonna break them in two and show you what your loving man can do   Until then, I'll cry instead...

"If something offensive is found at the library, should it be taken off of the shelves? Some people might look at this question and instantly say yes. Others might not think anything of the item and move along. I disagree with those who believe the item should be remove. Instead, I believe the item should not be removed and stay on the shelves.      As a child, I have always gone to the child's section of the library to find a book. I steared clear of the 'grown-up' area. So if my mother found an offensive item on the shelves she would make sure I didn't see it. I believe if the parent watches what their child sees then they wouldn't worry about them seeing something offensive.      However, let's say that an adult sees this item and feels it should be removed. She/he has the right to remove that item but what if, to someone else, that item was exactly what they were looking for? The world we live in has many offensive things in it that we see everyday, such as newspapers, @CAPS1 programs, billboards, etc., and if someone were to come along and take it all away, we would have nothing left but that one persons interests.      This is why we have a little bit of everything in our libraries. If there is an offensive book or a bad @CAPS2 and someone doesn't like it and feels the need to remove it, that is @CAPS3 but then they aren't thinking of what other people might like. I have always heard the saying, 'If everybody liked the same thing, it would be a boring world.' I find this to be completely true.      If everybody liked the same thing, then let anybody that enters the library remove an offensive item. However, if this happens, authors won't want to keep writing books and singers won't want their @CAPS4 there if they find out someone keeps removing their work. On the same note, people won't want to go to the library if they know they won't find what they want because someone took it down.      I disagree with the ones who feel the item should be removed because to someone that book might be perfect. I believe that the book or magazine or @CAPS2 should stay on the shelf for someone who has the intent to read it. If a person walks by and feels the book is offensive, they need realize that to someone else it might not be and walk away. I am sure people would find my choice of books offensive or bad and would like to remove them from shelves. However, I would stop going to the library if that happened.

"I dont see any reason why to take books off the shelves. If someone doesnt like a book, then they dont have to read it. Books are ment to entertain or inform people. There are books that talk about black people in a bad manner, but they still need to be out there so that people will know. Libraries are out to make money thats all. Let them make money, they can sell whatever they want.      If I had a library I would sell just about anything i could. people will: watch, listen, read anything. So why not sell it or rent it out. It's a honest way of making money..They say, ""Daddy you're a fool to cry   You're a fool to cry   You're a fool to cry   And it makes me wonder why""      I'm a fool baby   I'm a fool baby   I'm a certified fool, now   I want to tell ya   Gotta tell ya, baby   I'm a fool baby   I'm a fool baby   Certified fool for ya, mama, come on   I'm a fool   I'm a fool   I'm a fool.Goes to show you don't ever know   Watch each card you play and play it slow,   Wait until that deal come round, don't you let that deal go down..Sweetheart..These are the big fish   Who always try to eat down the small fish,   Just the small fish..Lord, my heart cries out glory to the King   My greatest love in life, I hand You everything   Glory, glory I hear the angels sing      Open my ears, let me hear Your voice   To know that sweet sound   Oh my soul rejoice   Glory, glory, I hear the angels sing      Chorus:   You're a Father to the fatherless   The answer to my dreams   I see you crowned in righteousness   We cry glory to the King   Comforter to the lonely   The lifter of my head   I see You veiled in majesty   We cry glory, glory   We cry glory to the King   We cry glory glory   We cry glory to the King.I'm not the way you think I am   The only girl who ever gave me the time   Was the one who only wanted five minutes of mine   Knocking boots in the back, how degrading is that?.(uh huh)   Get at least a hunned likes?.There's a heart in the middle of somewhere tonight   Screaming for reasons or just a way out   I put the shirt off my back on a wager that says   There's one every night from my old school yard days   I hear you say one golden rule   One golden rule      There's been times I've been stood in the wind and the rain   Freezing and busted and tricked out of luck   And I cursed my teachers for all of their reading   What we needed most can't be found in them books   One golden rule      Now they teach you to swim but they don't speak of the danger   Tell you the truth but they never say why   Put you on ice that is thin and tell you it's winter   Without one golden rule the truth is a lie   One golden rule.have been to hell,      Now I'm back an' I'm taking all I need!.I've spent my life waiting   For that famous final scene   I believe you know the one--   When she falls in love with me      As for you, you've been fakin' your smile   Fillin' your time   On small talk   And cheap wine   Knowing in your heart there was someplace   That you'd rather be      So right or wrong,   I wrote you this song   To tell you how I feel      Don't put up no fight   You just turn off the lights   Walk over here to me      [Chorus]   And lay your body down on me   Down on me tonight, oh yeah   Oh, let your tears fall down on me   Down on me tonight, oh yeah      As for me I've lied to, denied to   Fight with, and tried to   Apologize for all my ways   To all the women who were fool enough to fall   In love with me      You played your role   Like a movie   Got your lines for who is,   Who was, who would be   Somehow you lost track   While real love slipped away, yeah      So for tonight, just turn off the lights   And let those real feelings show   There's no wrong or right   But until you try   You're never gonna know      [Chorus]      Before you was mine   I was so lonely   Ain't it a shame   Your heart must feel pain   Before you get back on your feet again      So let's draw the blinds   Forget wasted time   And let them old demons die   Take a hold of my hand   Then you'd understand   Why love's worth one more try      [Chorus].Do it for you,   Sure that you would do the same for me one day..It was written that I would love you   From the moment I opened my eyes   And the morning when I first saw you   Gave me life under calico skies      I will hold you for as long as you like   I'll hold you for the rest of my life      Always looking for ways to love you   Never failing to fight at your side   While the angels of love protect us   From the innermost secrets we hide      I'll hold you for as long as you like   I'll hold you for the rest of my life      Long live all of us crazy soldiers   Who were born under calico skies   May we never be called to handle   All the weapons of war we despise      I'll hold you for as long as you like   I'll hold you for the rest of my life   I'll hold you for as long as you like   I'll love you for the rest of my   For the rest of my life.In 1999 I'll be free, so:      (Don't U wanna feel good?).Commando girls you'll never never catch them crying!.Help me get my feet back on the ground,   Won't you please, please help me?.Do you ever feel ashamed?.Are you on fire,   From the years?.Take back the weed take back the cocaine baby   Take back the pills take back the whiskey too   I don't need them now your love was all I was after   I'll make it now I can get off on you   I can get by on little or nothing at all I know   I can get high just thinkin' about you and so   Well take back the weed...

"'@CAPS1, @CAPS1, @CAPS1 I like @CAPS4 @CAPS5 and I can not lie, when a girl walks in with an itty bitty waste and a round thing in your face you get sprung.' @CAPS2 song in itself depicts a rather provocative tone towards women and men. While '@CAPS3 a'las what sorrows can be seen over yonder' tells us that love can be found anywhere. Now look closly at both lymrics you will eventually see a connection in both. The rap song @CAPS4 @CAPS5 is about a man that finds love in large glutius maximi while the other says that love can be seen everywhere, and anywhere.     To say that music, magazines, books, and more should be banned is to say that throwing an @CAPS6 flag on the floor is just okay. Well its not; banning books, music, etc. is just like cencoring someones imaginationa and creativity. It is just like the book @DATE1, where @CAPS4 @CAPS8 is watching, and that we are only based on what we are allowed to read, and even think. Taking away movies and books, is to not allow people to learn from their past.     Take @CAPS9 @CAPS10 @CAPS11 for example, though that movie is rather gory and morbid, it still tells us of the horrors of the time during @CAPS12 @CAPS13 @NUM1 and that the past is never something that should be let go. Always remeber the past so you can learn from it. Had that movie been cencored or removed I personally would have never learned about the hardtimes of the @CAPS13 and what it can do to a persons soul and emotions.     A book, magazine, movie, etc are all gateways to new worlds, where children can use their imagination and justify what their personality is. I can say that books and songs have saved lives. The other day a friend of mine was on the edge of suicide and was almost a squeeze away from pulling the trigger when I told him that what he was doing was wrong. I was @NUM2 at the time, and i rushed through my ipod to find a song '@CAPS14 to @CAPS15 a @CAPS16' by the @CAPS17. I basically read him the lyrics and he eventually put the idea of sucicide away.     While yes, there aresongs & books like The @CAPS18 and the @CAPS19 that @MONTH1 have provoked people to do crazy things, even to kill. We stilll see more good being done and shown through reading and writing. Because they are all ways to express ourselves. A song can @CAPS15 a @CAPS16 as much as it can take one away. Even then we can that letting imagination flow is better than letting the imagination get cencored. If a book is seen as something unwanted or taken away, it will cause more harm in that it would be wanted more, it would be craved becasue it is an unreachable thing.Love is all that remains the same,   That's what it's all comin' to..Chorus:   Where I'm From These Boys Go Out n Bang   Lo los wit the doors out to swing   Aint no issue   An' it damn sure aint gon' miss you   If it's out to get you   Then dat thing wont miss you      (Itll leave a it'll leave a it'll leave a body bag X3)   (Itll leave a body bag it'll leave a bo body bag)      Lil Wayne:      Tool on deck why would I lie   Na you a pussy   Hope you got 9 lives   I can hit a na wit a 9 9 times   Country ass boi country like leann rimes      Mississippi, D Banner 'n' Lil Weezyana   E'rbody got 2 so you will need a hammer   I'm a Pill poppin animal syrup sippin na   I'm so high you can't reach me with a Fuckin antennae      You fuckin with this man you can eat his man dinner   The 9 get me bruntin but dat ak at lever   Your out there the same flowin like a bad river   Make your ass quiver like you naked at winter      Chorus:   Where I'm From These Boys Go Out n Bang   Lo los wit the doors out to swing   Aint no issue   An' it damn sure aint gon' miss you   If it's out to get you   Then dat thing wont miss you      (Itll leave a it'll leave a it'll leave a body bag X3)   (Itll leave a body bag it'll leave a bo body bag)      Young jeezy:   I'm amazin Yea I'm all dat   If I aint on my grind   Then what you call that   Victorious, yea we warriors   We make history, Strive off victories      Standin at My Podium   I'm Tryin to watch my sodium   Got high blood pressure   Even if tha Feds getcha      I'm amazin Born on a Full moon   I was bred to get it in No Spoon   That's why I'm so Crude   Summertime no Juice   Make Them Small house No Room      They like O God   Night comes so hard   Look what he's been through   He deserves an applause      Chorus:   Where I'm From These Boys Go Out n Bang   Lo los wit the doors out to swing   Aint no issue   An' it damn sure aint gon' miss you   If it's out to get you   Then dat thing wont miss you      (Itll leave a it'll leave a it'll leave a body bag X3)   (Itll leave a body bag it'll leave a bo body bag)      T.

"The world today in the @LOCATION1 is hardly free. Everything that we see, hear, and read is censored. Is this good or bad? For the most part, it is good. Adults, teenagers, and young children all should only be allowed access to certain types of movies, music, books, magazines, radio stations, and so on.     I don't believe they should be removed, but I do believe these materials should have limited access. Some materials are kind of hard to keep from children and teenagers, but I believe what is kept from children is up to children's parents to say whether or not the children can watch, look at, or listen to what ever it @MONTH1 be that is concidered offensive to some people. Some materials are and should continue to be censored, but to an extent. If a person were to watch an @CAPS1-@CAPS2 movie or even unrated at a movie theater, that person would have to be @NUM1 years of age or older. That is the law, and I believe this is a good thing.      Parents should, also, definitely be the one's to censor what children watch, see, hear, or read. Children for the most part don't know any better. Children are curious little beings. If there is something that a parent has laying around the house that the child has never seen before that child will immediately wonder what this material is. If it were a magazine, they might look at it. I believe that there is a certain age to be allowed to look at these things, because there are a lot of materials in this world that are meant for adults only.    These materials have to be kept open to the public or else all the people who don't find these materials bad would be broke because people fight for what they believe in and that costs money, especially if the people want to take their opinion as to why they should be able to see or hear whatever they want to because they are an adult and they are mature enough to participate in these activities. The people who fight for what they believe in would need a lawyer. Lawyers have to be paid or else they will not work for you.     There are a lot of people around the world who know what they believe is good and bad. It's all in how these people being are raised, and were raised as a child themselves. If people believe something is bad, then they don't have to read, listen to, look at, or watch any of the things they find offensive. These activities are only for the people who do not have a problem with seeing or hearing these materials, therefore these materials should be censored, but only to a certain extent.     If everything in this world that even one person found offensive were removed, then, what about all of the other people who do not find those materials offensive? What about the adults who find no harm in seeing or hearing these things? Not every person in this world has the same opinion.     In conclusion, not everything should be censored. The materials children see and hear is up to parents. People will fight for their freedom to see and hear what they want because people know what they want and will get it any way they have to.

"Censorship of @CAPS1 of @CAPS2            'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf -- that work I abhor -- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us,' is a quote from Author, Katherine Paterson. She is saying that there are some books that most people would think to be a little graphic or shocking, but we can not take those books off the shelf because then eventually there would be no books left to read. I agree with her in the sense that we can not take certain books off the shelves in our library. We can not take them off the shelves because that would be taboo in many ways. It would be stepping into hot water because the people would be violating the authors freedom of the press, who would decide what material was right and wrong, and how far is too far when it comes to censorship. These are just a few of the many reasons this is wrong.     Taking certain books of shelves would be against our constitution. The @CAPS3 @CAPS4 gives all @CAPS5 citizens the freedom of the press. This means that they can write anything that they want without having to worry about the government's or the citizens' opinions. If we start taking certain books off shelves of libraries because they @MONTH1 include a few controversial things we are violating there natural right. Which leads me to my next argument in if we do allow censorship, who should be in charge?     So many people want to include their opinions on what is right and what is wrong. So, who are we supposed to believe? On person @MONTH1 think somthing is out of line, but the person standing next to them would think it is ordinary. That is what makes this country great. We are a mixture of many different ideas that work together for a common goal. If the government would assign someone to censoring books, magazines, or music, there would be a uproar. How can one person say if something is wrong? And if someone was allowed to censor things, what would be included? How far is to far?     This is a hard question to ask. If we were to allow one person to judge things what should be included? Would the judgement stop at just books, movies, and music? Or would it expand to judgement of clothes and lifestyles? If we implement this system of censorship, our who lives would become one big judgement. Self expression would go out the window because people would be scared of being deemed 'inapropriate.' Our world would become a puzzle of trying to fit in and to not be noticed, rather than standing out and pushing the human race forward.     There are always going to be those people who disagree with things. They find it out of place or offensive. What we have to realize is that everyone views things in different ways. We as people need to learn to accept something out of the ordinary, and try to understand where otheres are comming from. If we can do that our world would be a much better place.O   E unha cantiga cantaba   Moza que v?.If it's just inadvertent simulation a pattern in all mankind   What's got the whole world fakin' it?.I couldn't see paradise right before my eyes   When I had you here by my side   I didn't know that no one else   Could ever take your place   But, now I know   I know that I should have stayed   And seeing you tonight   I only wonder why I ever said, goodbye   Any other fool would never walk away   Even a fool would still be there holding you   Any other fool would know I never   Should have let you go   I had it all as any fool could see   Any other fool but me, oh, ahh, oh   Anyone else never would have let the feeling die   Anyone else would have fought to keep it alive   If they were in my shoes, they'd know the love we had   Was love too good to lose   Any other fool would never walk away   Even a fool would still be there holding you   Oh, any other fool would know   I never should have let you go   I had it all when you were loving me   I had it all as any fool could see   Any other fool but me, oh, oh, oh   I had it all when you were loving me   I had it all as any fool could see   Any other fool but me   Any other fool would never walk away   Even a fool would still be there holding you   Oh, any other fool would know   Never should have let you go   Had it all as any fool could see   Any other fool but me   Oh, oh, oh   Even a fool would still be there holding you   Any other fool would know   I never should have let you go   I had it all as any fool could see.I surrender!).With a sword and a pistol by his side, Uh-huh..Down deep inside   There's a place in me I'm yearning to explore   Look in my eyes   And remember wine, the music and amour   The days grow stronger and longer   With every glance   It's what a stare and the dance were   To find romance   While dancers dance so close      Deep inside to our dream of dreams   Our theme of themes   Romance      Yes I'm falling watch me falling   Something warm is turning inside of me   Something warm is burning inside of me.He had Dinos and Pooh Bears   And lions, pink and blue there   He couldn't lose there!.If you just believe..Christy's comment      Barney Rush was home and we organised a sing-song in   The brought Mick Curry who sang this   Song..Some boys kiss me   Some boys hug me   I think they're ok   If they don't give me proper credit   I just walk away      They can beg and they can plead   But they can't see the light (that's right)   'Cause the boy with the cold hard cash   Is always Mister Right      'Cause we are living in a material world   And I am a material girl   You know that we are living in a material world   And I am a material girl      Some boys romance   Some boys slow dance   That's all right with me   If they can't raise my interest then I   Have to let them be      Some boys try and some boys lie but   I don't let them play (no way)   Only boys who save their pennies   Make my rainy day      'Cause we're living in a material world   And I am a material girl   You know that we are living in a material world   And I am a material girl   Living in a material world   And I am a material girl   You know that we are living in a material world   And I am a material girl      Living in a material world (material)   Living in a material world   Living in a material world (material)   Living in a material world      Boys may come and boys may go   And that's all right you see   Experience has made me rich   And now they're after me      'Cause everybody's living in a material world   And I am a material girl   You know that we are living in a material world   And I am a material girl   Living in a material world   And I am a material girl   You know that we are living in a material world   And I am a material girl      A material, a material, a material, a material world      Living in a material world (material)   Living in a material world   Living in a material world (material)   Living in a material world      Living in a material world (material)   Living in a material world   Living in a material world (material)   Living in a material world.(Tattoo, tattoo) So very autobiographic..Are you growing tired of my love?.I've felt the ocean's roar..Oh, the locusts sang off in the distance,   And the locusts sang and they were singing for me..Poisonous lookalike   You're not my girl   Poisonous lookalike   What have you done with her?.The buzzard tried to throw the monkey   Off his back,   The monkey grabbed his neck and said,   ""Now listen, Jack...""

"I think that censorship should not matter in a library due to the fact that some of those books, magazines, music, and movies, are liked by different people everywhere. If you do not like something said or seen in some of the materials, then do not read or watch or listen to any of them. People have different tastes in what they like to listen to or watch or read about. Some people might like rap music but other might like rock music. People that like rock music might not like rap because of some of the languauge used in songs. This is why some people listen to other types of music and do not listen to the type of music that they find offensive. I like rock and metal music just because rap is a little offensive. I have had a lot of family members say that i shouldnt be listening to such music because of the language.     Some people say that reading certain things is a prefferance, but what if you are sitting in a doctors' office and you would like to read a magazine that is just sitting around. If you start going through the magazine and find something you do not like or take offense to, either keep flipping the pages or put the magazine down. You have to think to yourself that there are other people that enjoy or are interested in something you might find offensive. The best thing you can do is put it down and think to yourself that it is not directed towards you. Magazines can have all sorts of stuff hidden beyond the pages, but sometimes you have to look at the cover to see what some of the things that are written in the magazine. Sometimes this can help you decide on rather or not to read it.      Movies are always fun to watch no matter what occation. Some people like certain movies such as action, comedy, romance, or drama. Some people might not like action due to the fact that there is violence in almost all of those movies. Some might not like comedy because of some of the rude humor. There are just alot of types of movies out there and its not the producers fault that we do not like it. People make different movies because everyone is not alike. Some people might get offended by some of the contents of a movie and what you could do to help that is just by reading into the movies before seeing them.

"Censorship of books     Should books, music, movies, magazines, etc., be removed from shelves if they are found offensive? Yes because certain things need to be removed from the shelves for example many things that don't need to be seen out in public. Personaly I think censoring certain things is alright because there are certain books that shouldn't be seen, music that has either swearing talking about drugs or other things, movies that kids shouldn't see like the rated '@CAPS1' or '@NUM1' that has either blood or nudity or somethen on that line, and magazines now magazines there are many types of magazines like for example adult, children, cooking, cleaning, house things, stuff for dogs or cats, and outside stuff.      But censoring things that could be 'offensive' I can't understand how books can be offensive because some books are talking about history or something that has happen to them. Like for example lets just say a colored kid comes in and reads a book on '@CAPS2 slavery' that kid right there is going to get offensive about it and then that kid is going to say 'You owe me something because my anscetores were slaves' no your very wrong there kid because you either read the book wrong or you just didn't understand it. I have done that a couple of times either I got offensive about it and started getting very angry about it or just tose it in the trash because I got mad because I got offensive about it. Don't get me wrong I love reading but like I said before certain things are just ment to never be read or just never be found.     But as for me getting offensive about a couple of books, movies, music, or magazines @CAPS13 I don't read magazines so I can't get offensive about that but books, movies, and music I take very offesively because like if I read lets just say the '@CAPS3 @CAPS4' and then I watch the movies @CAPS13 I take it offensively because nothing didn't tie in with the books or that person didn't direct it right.      For books like I said I love reading books don't get me wrong but I do take very offensively because like something the character did or something that I wished I shouldn't have done something like that or a character dies and it reminds me of a close friend of mine or a teacher something on that line I either cry or I just stop reading the book period.     Music now I could go all day on that because for example I used to love rap with a passion but now rap is just becoming horrible because the rapper is either talking about killing someone, drugs, or 'sex' it's like I said 'horrible' thats one thing that needs to go away for a long long time. But there are many other types besides rap. There is @CAPS5, @CAPS6, @CAPS7 @CAPS8, punk, @CAPS1&@CAPS10, etc like I said I could go all day on music.     The people who are censoring things like t.v. shows like for example @CAPS11 @CAPS12 seriously there is nothing wrong with that show some people are censoring that because adults think it is bad @CAPS13 people there is nothing bad with that show. I have been watching it since I was five years old and there was nothing bad on it then, then why would there be something bad on it now. All there is, is a grown man acting like a child it's like your going to tell your husband or your wife or your kids '@CAPS13 @CAPS14 I'm sorry but I have to censore you because your a bad person.'

"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 Newspaper, or to whom this article @MONTH1 concern.     It has become quite aware to me the problem we face in our media today. Information and how individuals seek it has evolved and is still changing at a rapid pace. Technology and new information is so vast its extremely difficult to censor.       Two weeks ago i took my @NUM1 year old niece @CAPS3 to our local public library to find her a book. Once the automatic  doors to the library opened she darted straight to the movie section. I couldnt help but laugh, because I knew thats why she truly wanted to go to the library. When i asked @CAPS3 what movie she was looking at, she turned the cover over with no reservation and, said' @CAPS5 @CAPS6'. 'I can't let my young niece watch @CAPS5 @CAPS6', I thought silently to myself. Then i realized how easy it is for a child to access adult information.      I agree with the statement of @PERSON1 in some degree. I believe if we started taking certian information away completly we would find ourselves ignorant. But when we let  our children ,the future of the world, vonerable to adult information they are greatly effected, @CAPS9 teens and violent video games, or explicit magazines. For example my niece is able to check out any book in the library, books like @CAPS10 @CAPS11 famous book intitled '@CAPS12 @CAPS13 ', which means my struggle in german. My @NUM1 year old niece can read quite well and is very impressionable as are many young children.     Public media outlets need to be more heavily monitored, this includes public libraries, retail stores, the internet, and @CAPS14. I believe books should be censored by content much like movies. This makes the distibutor left responsible and the consumer more aware of the content and its effect.Usher (yeah man)   So we back in the club   With our bodies rockin' from side to side (side to side)   Thank God the week is done   I feel like a zombie goin' back to life (back to life)   Hands up, and suddenly we all got our hands up   No control of my body   Ain't I seen you before?.Dad did sigh   But the mad old goat just wouldn't die!.(Young Jeezy):   It's M.C..Eddie the Eunuch was a weasel   Nasty as an old man's nose   Making believin' he was evil   Struttin' in his mama's clothes      You know that Eddie had a bad connection   Never had a chance to ball   Sleeping in the wrong direction, baby   Dreaming he was ten feet tall      But now Eddie the Eunuch is a rock and roll critic   Sucking like a super star   Slicker than a shoe-shine   Quicker than a two-time      Eddie what a thang you are   Eddie makes a damn good livin', baby   Putting other people down      Eddie couldn't ever forgive them baby   'Cause he wasn't Jackson Browne..I feel like running away from the blues.In the web of wild design,   I do not know what fate is mine!.It started rainin'   But we both were insane   An' we kept right ..Chorus      You'd better get born in some place else..I know what you think   It's clear as mud in your eyes   We're the plastic poseurs and prostitutes   You've obviously come to despise      But you don't know nothing   You're not hot enough to matter   You don't understand it's the glamorous life   A dream that no one can shatter      [Chorus]   We're shameless   We will do anything   To get our fifteen minutes of fame   We have no integrity   We're ready to crawl   To obtain celebrity   We'll do anything at all      I'm ambitious   Believe me, I'm going to be big   I'm a slave to glamour   Applause and clamour   My makeup, my wardrobe, my wigs      Don't call me pathetic   I'm harder than you'll ever guess   Relentlessly tough, for when the going gets rough   The tough get their picture in the press      [Chorus]      (Anything, anything, anything at all)   (We'll do anything, anything, anything at all)   (We'll do anything, anything, anything at all)   (We'll do anything, anything, anything at all)   [It's going perfectly alright]   [How dare you?.Or paint a million stars that I might   Know Your majesty?.Feelin' like it's all over, feelin' like there's no love   Feelin' like it's not easy, breathin' life in the dust   On a countdown to zero take a ride on the nightmare machine      There ain't gonna be heroes   There ain't gonna be anything   Oh   Here it comes, here comes the night   Here it comes, hell in the night   Here it comes, here comes the night      When we all fall down   When we walk into silence   When we shadow the sun   When we surrender to violence   Oh   Then the damage is done   Put away that gun!.Where else i should be?.You better turn around   And blow your kiss hello to life eternal.....When I'm down, I can't stand cloudy days      Cloudy days don't the sun ever shine anymore?.""'Shows with love and affection',   Like mama used to say..Words and music by jenkins   [g] a prodigal son once [c] strayed from his [g] father   To travel a land of [a] hunger and [d] pain   And [g] now I can see the [c] end of my [g] journey   I'm going to [d] heaven a-[g] gain..Say, can you see,   By the dawns early light,   What so proudly we hailed   At the twilight's last gleaming?.She threw me outside,   I stood in the dirt where ev'ryone walked..All the white boys   Sit down!.Hypocrites!.It seems like you're ready (seems like you're ready)..Allelujah!"
"Some people ask, '@CAPS1 books should be censored from libraries?' @CAPS2 are always parents who think that the libraries have books that are inappropriate for their kids, so they speak out against the library and tell them to censor or remove the books. I believe that in order for a library to censor or remove books, magazines, movies, music, etc., it depends on @CAPS1 the subject matter of those things are about.      It's also the parent's job to monitor @CAPS1 their kids read, listen to, or watch. @CAPS2's no reason for a library to censor and take away books because one or two parents complain that it's inappropriate, when the parent can just pull their kids away from the book or movie and move on to something else. It's not the libraries job to watch kids and make sure they don't read, listen to, or watch anything bad. It's the parent's job.      Katherine Paterson, an author, had a good point, also. She said that if she has the right to take books off the shelf, then so does everyone else. If everyone else starts taking books off the shelf, we have no books left. Everyone has a different view of books. @CAPS1 one person thinks is bad, another @MONTH1 not. It goes the other way, too: @CAPS1 one person thinks is good, another @MONTH1 think is bad. On the subject of movies, @CAPS2 are some that should be censored, like the movies containing extreme violence or gore. I remember going to the library when I was a kid, and I wanted to check out a @CAPS3 movie. I couldn't check it out because I wasn't at least @NUM1. I though it was ridiculous because it was only a @CAPS3 movie, and it was harmless.      With magazines and music, it depends on the subject matter of those as well. Some magazines contain inappropriate pictures and articles for young kids, and it's those things that should be kept away from the kids. They don't neccessarily need to be censored or taken away, just kept in another section for teens and adults. The music poses a problem, though. A lot of the music these days can be very inappropriate, especially rap music. Music that sends negative messages and contains a lot of cursing in the lyrics should be censored, in my opinion. It doesn't belong in a library environment where young kids are roaming around and where they're influenced by it.      In conclusion, books, music, movies, and magazines should or should not be censored or removed based on the subject. It just depends on @CAPS1 the subject is about and how inappropriate it is. @CAPS1 one parent thinks is bad, another @MONTH1 not. Overall, I think that books, music, movies, and magzines shouldn't be censored. Parents can just decide @CAPS1 they want their kid(s) to read, watch, or listen to.I've known a lot of girls..Heart of mine be still   You can play with fire but you'll get the bill   Don't let her know   Don't let her know that you love her   Don't be a fool, don't be blind   Heart of mine..He'll remember this day for the rest of his life..It's been very hard   But it's getting easier now   Hard times are over, over for a while      The leaves are shining in the sun   And smiling inside   You and I watching each other on a street corner   Cars and buses and planes and people go by      But we don't care   We want to know   We want to know in each other's eyes   That hard times are over, over for sometime      Hard times are over   Hard times are over   Hard times are over, over for a while      It's been very rough   But it's getting easier now   Hard times are over, over for a while      The streams are twinkling in the sun   And I'm smiling inside   You and I walking together 'round the street corner      Hard times are over   Hard times are over   Hard times are over, over for a while.Is it over?.Say everybody   And everyone   We've been waitin', so very long   To play some music   And have some fun      Bring some happiness to everyone   Well come with us and try and learn   What's on your mind   Open your ears and eyes and let's see what you can find   You're not so different, I don't mean to be unkind   Something's unfolding if you really take the time      So let the sun shine   It's just begun   You've given all you could to anyone   Well don't you lose it   Don't run away   It's getting stronger, day after day      You're sittin' there, you say you're   Waiting for the show   And what you have, and what you   Hear is what you really want to know   You've only come here 'cause here's   Nowhere else to go   We're only sorry, that we have   To end the show..Can she make a feather bed,   Charming Billy?.He tried a second time, but still, he could not pull it out..Commando girls...

"Today I am going to talk about certain materials, such as books, music, movies, and magazines. Should they be removed from the shelf if they are found offensive? In todays world it is hard to please every living soul. Every one is going to disagree about something in there life time.      Life as we know it, everybody lives it a different way, and in a different place, but everybody has read a book, listened to music, and even read a magazine a time or to. People @MONTH1 interpride it different than others. Therefore I personally dont think they should take articules out of the library that you can learn something from, unless it's something like pornograh then they should deffently take it out.     My conclusion is that you cant please everybody. I think that you shouln't take things out of the library that can help a student learn..Bigger than man walking on the moon   Coming to a theatre near you soon   This is what I'm living for   You get a little bit   And you want a little more      Everything is fine   Crimes of the mind   I drink a little wine   Crimes of the mind   Here's to modern times   Crimes of the mind      Every dog will have it's day   And all these dogs just want to play   You will reap what you sow   But the real truth we will never know      Everything is fine   Crimes of the mind   I drink a little wine   Crimes of the mind   Here's to modern times   Crimes of the mind      Rolling in the grime   Crimes of the mind   Digging for a dime   Crimes of the mind   Blind leading the blind   Crimes of the mind.Have we been in love forever?.Look at me   I'm on my way to the promise land      I'm on the highway to hell   Highway to hell   I'm on the highway to hell   Highway to hell      Don't stop me!.Too much of a good thing   Has really burnt me out   I'm sick of satisfaction   And living in a drought      Just be yourself   Anyway that you want to   Just be yourself   Anyway that you can   Just be yourself   Anyway that you want to, baby   Just be yourself   Anyway that you can      The center of attention   Is living on the edge   The thirty of second floor   I'm standing on a ledge      Got to get this straight   Cos we're running too late      Just be yourself   Anyway that you want to, baby   Just be yourself   Anyway that you can   Just be yourself   Anyway that you want to baby   Just be yourself   Anyway that you can      Just be yourself   Anyway that you want to, baby   Just be yourself   Anyway that you can   Just be yourself   Anyway that you want to, baby   Just be yourself   Anyway that you can   Just be yourself   Anyway that you want to   Just be yourself   Anyway that you can   Just be yourself   Anyway that you want to, baby   Just be yourself   Anyway that you can   Just be yourself   Anyway, baby   Just be yourself   Anyway that you can.Please crawl out your window   Use your arms and legs it won't ruin you   How can you say he will haunt you   You can go back to him any time you want to..Put on the red shoes that you want to..Every little counts   When I am with you   I think you are a pig   You should be in a zoo   I guess I should've known   I'd end up on my own   Every second counts when I am with you      Every little counts   When I am with you   Even though you're stupid   I still follow you   The smile upon your face   It always stays in place   Every little counts oh, when I am with you   (Do-do-do-do...)

"At a local library you can find hundreds of books, all of different matter, a different style and of different stories. Not every person enjoys the same type of topic to read about, not every person enjoys the same music style, nor does every person enjoy the same fashion in a magazine or the same articles written in the magazine. No one is the same, we all have different likes and interest.      Some people @MONTH1 find certain books distrubing and inapporiate, that the book shouldnt be allowed to be on the shelves of libraries. That is only some people, what one person finds distrubing and gross another person can find interesting. Not one person is the same so not all books are going to be eye ctaching and interesting to every person. If one person finds a book to be inapporaite, yet another finds it interesting and suggest that book to their friends, is that one whom disagress upon the reading material as unexceptable to thier community allowed to take the book from the shelf, not allowing anyone else to read it. Everyone should be given the same oppertunity to read the book that another made find inapporaite.     People should be allowed to read the material and topics they enjoy to read. But when it comes to a nude magazine, all about sex and being naked, that should be in adult stores only. A child in the library can wonder over to the adult side and pick up the magazine and see all those women, that mother doesnt want her child to be able to pick up and porn magazine or video when she takes the child to the library. You must be eighteen or older to view or buy those magazines, so only keep those magazine in adult stores where childern wont be able to view them. Now some books @MONTH1 have a naked picture in the text but it could be to show how to give a breast examination, to educate women about breast cancer and to help prevent seriousness over that matter, to well educate the people in our society about the matter. Books of diseases that @MONTH1 have nude photos should be allowed, they educate the communitry and save lives. Although not one persons voice or opinion should be heard over others, we were all created equal, we all should be heard. Books are as of the same way, they were all created equal for men, women, boys, and girls to be allowed to read and find adventure, excitment, sorrow and anger. We all have different hungrys for different reading, music and fashin.     In this world today, in our society, and in our community there are different views upon what the children should be reading or should be allowed to pick off the shelf at their local library. Books were created by different people, who dont share the same views,who look upon life in a different way, whose voices arent all the same. The book has a curse word in the text, that doesnt mean the book is an abomination and will poison the community. That book could be one of the best books the child or adult has every read in their life.       Everyone has different views, likes, interest, wants and needs. Not one person shares the same hunger of reading material. We should all be given the oppertunity to read or not read what another person finds inapporaite. The author as well deserves to be heard and not shunned out because some people view his or her material unexecptable for the shelves of their local library. Freedom of speech, freedom of happiness should be implyed with the pursuite to find a book that feeds the hunger of one person. Let every voice be heard, let every word be read, no matter how big, small, or how many imapporaite context is included.Let everyone read as they please and let everyone be marry in what they read.Come stare al ristorante   Se non hai niente da dire e vabb?.Come on!.I thought I knew you,   What did I know?.Maybe I'm all messed up in you..Lonely time's gone by..what did I do?.Well, I suppose that you could say that we were playing hard to get..My heart is beating to the old refrain   When I'm alone with you..As long as there's water   Chilly wet water   Gimme some of that cool water      Well, my horse's eyes are glassy   He breathed the city in his lungs last night   I lead his natural body   To the trough to regain his might      Red rooster crow them blues here   That Old Blue he round the bull   And the mornin's crying rays of sunrise   It hasn't rained for three weeks full      As long as there's water   Chilly well water   Gimme some of that cool, cool water      Venus light is rising   I lay my buckets inside the shed   And there's a man I see -

"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3:     @CAPS4 I am @PERSON1 and I have heard there has been a discussion about different things in libraries.  And I would like to let you know what I think about the whole situation.  There are many things like books, music, movies, magazines, etc. that people believe aren't appropriate.  Many people have differnt opinions then other people. Everyone had a differnt point of view and sees things differently.  Ecspecially when it comes to what is appropriate for kids.     I believe if a child comes home with a book, movies, etc. and their parent does not approve the parent should go and tell the librarian about why she thinks it isn't appropriate.  The librarian should listen to the parent and then take a look at it for herself and see what she thinks about it.  And if she finds it not approprite then she has the right to take it off the shelf.     If the parent comes in and talks to the librarian about why something is not apropriate and the librarian believes it is alright then maybe she needs to just put the book, movie, etc. in a different area of the library.  Like if a little kid finds a book and the parent says its inappropriate the librarian could take that book out of the little kid section, and maybe put it in a older kid area.       I have actaully had an experience with this.  At my old school adults were always complaining about books they didn't think were appropriate.  When the librarian told us, we were upset because us girls loved to read those books.  The librarian at the time thought they were appropriate and really didn't want to take them out of the library.  So she had a great idea.  She took those books, the ones people were complaining about, and put them on their own special shelf behind her desk.  If you wanted one of those books you had to talk to your parent or bring a note in saying that you were allowed to read the book.  It was a really good idea, because if your parent wouldn't allow you to read them you weren't tempted to get one, and wouldnt even see them.  And the people who were allowed and wanted to read them still could with no problem at all.     Another idea I have is if you see a younger kid by older people books, movies, etc. go talk to them about why they are over there and, tell them that, that's not their age level material.  Try to direct them over to their age level area, and try to find them a book, movie, etc they @MONTH1 be interested in.     I believe that everyone has different opinions but just because one person complains it doesn't mean it has to ruin it for everyone.  Just because one person doesn't like it doesn't mean everyone else does too.  I think censorship should somewhat be in libraries, but not to the extreme.  There should be many different topics in libraries so everyone enjoyes the stuff there.  There should be action,adventure, humor, love, etc.  Talk to people and see what they like.  And just because one person complains, dont take it out right away because to another person they might love it.  Thank you for taking your time to read my opinion, and I hope I helped.Whoa-oh, Friday's child   Ya' cannot stop..Lay down Sally, no need to leave so soon   I've been trying all night long just to

"i think that the libraries in generally shouldn't take themusic,movies, or the magazines away. Because you never know what goes on at there home and they just want to get   away and relax the self at the library to read. I think that they shouldn't take the books off the the shelves just for a reason because people love going to the library.And if they don't have those things then what the point of going there.my other thing that they shouldn't take those things away is thatthey will not make a profit. when the people go to the libraryand they dont see those things they are going to wonder want happen.i think that it shouldn't be the children fault that all of the books are gone. It should be the owners and the people that work at the library fault that they made them take the booksoff the shelves.I also think that when the children goes to the library they are going to ask there parent or someone.Where are the book because they want to read and also where are the book so they can check them out.But the people would want to keep getting the books from the library to check them out.I think that the people should not take the books off the shelves for a specific reason and that reason is that people and children would go like on a weekend to read if they dont have any of those things at home.My thing is that they shouldn't just remove anything at all because it going to be a big commotion. So  by removing all of  that would be sad because what if no one has no place to go and they are feeling loney and they want to go the library and read. but my whole point agbout it is that who came up with no books,music or magzines on the shelves.But i also think that if they did that in the real world. Then it would be terrible and a crisis to the people.I think that they should not do that because the people love to read listen to music and etc. I also think that they should not do that because people love going to to releave some stress that they might have and they jus want to go there.I also think that they might not do it anyways because they know the people love there jobs to not to.One of the things that i like is that when i go to the library it is nice and quiet and we can listen to our ipod or our @NUM1 player something like that.Some people just love to go so that they can see there friends and communicate with them to get on the computer. My reason is that they shouldn't do that is they can lose everything like there jobs and etc..We're just the singers in a rock and roll band..Your chance finis..Ah you alone have that style there

"Censorship in librarys could be useful so children and young people don't see what their parents don't want them to see. In the kids section, they have kid's books. In the adult section they have adult books. Those sections are there to keep children from reading or seeing things that @MONTH1 be what their parents don't want them seeing. But then again, a parent could bring their kids into those sections so they can find their books without leaving their child unattended.     Completely taking books out of the library because they are offensive is not a good thing. It takes away certain literature that people might like reading. But then it also makes those people that want it censored uptight. I am a big reader so I have been to librarys many times but I never actually saw any material that was so bad I thought it needed to be taken out. If there was though, they should just make an alternative section for books, music, movies, and magazines that some people think should be put there.      For example, some albums that contain offensive language or topics have '@CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3' stickers on them. It's simple enough to see these stickers so that you can put it in the alternative section of a library. People that like and want to listen to that can easily go to that section and pick it out. Books always have reviews, so people can tell if those are too @CAPS1 or not. The library staff could put those books in the alternative section. Movies always have ratings, so staff could put anything rated @CAPS4 or above on those shelves. Now I've never seen a bad magazine at a library before. I'm sure they would never have magazines such as '@CAPS5' or '@ORGANIZATION1' there. People wouldn't need to worry about magazines from my experience.      That is my solution. Make an alternative section for all the offensive material in the library instead of taking it out completely. That takes away a lot of literature for the people that like that material. You couldn't take away movie classics like '@CAPS6' or '@CAPS7'. Those movies have been put on the highest of best film lists. Yes, they are rated @CAPS4 but no, that doesn't take away the fact that they are great movies. Don't take the material out. Just make a new section for it..I'll be with you darling soon,   I'll be with you when the stars start falling..You get what you come for, ya ready to go   Well, it's one in ten thousand that come for the show..So close!.Maybe there's just one little spot   Maybe some corner that you forgot   Is there a place in your left for me?.It's on like Donkey Kong   You wanted that fast buck   Now I gotta light that ass up   The nigga with the big fat trigger   Don't test me, gravedigger had the swig   Of the ST, remember the time we first met her   You threw your set up now you gotta get wetter   Boom!.You've got to be the one for me,   I always pray that you will stay, so baby, don't you go..Today I took a walk in the clouds   Today I took a walk in the clouds   Used to keep my eyes wide shut, but now I'm staring down      Today I felt a switch in my vein   Today I felt a switch in my vein   Used to be a shadow now   A shadow scream my name   And in the daylight I could swear   We're the same      But I'm just an ordinary human (Ordinary ways)   I'm just an ordinary human   But I don't feel so ordinary today   I'm just a picture perfect nothing   Sometimes I medicate   I'll be a picture perfect human   Before the sun goes down today      Today I felt a switch in my vein   Today I made them all afraid   Used to be a shadow now   A shadow scream my name   And in the daylight I could swear   We're the same   But I'm just an ordinary human (Ordinary ways)      I'm just an ordinary human   But I don't feel so ordinary today   I'm just a picture perfect nothing   Sometimes I medicate   I'll be a picture perfect human   Before the sun goes down today      Just an ordinary human   But I don't feel so typical today      There'll be peace in the city tonight   Peace in the city tonight   But when I'm gone   I hope they get it right   There'll be peace in the city tonight   Peace in the city tonight   For when I'm gone   I hope they get it right      Just an ordinary human   (Ordinary ways)   I'm ordinary human   I don't feel so ordinary today      But when I'm gone   I hope they get it right.Livin' under house -- Guess I'm livin', I'm a mouse..The woman is a devil,   That's what I've been told..And that happy tune is your step   Life can be so sweet   On the sunny side of the street      I used to walk in the shade   With those blues on parade   But I'm not afraid   This rover crossed over      If I never have a cent   I'll be rich as Rockefeller   Gold dust at my feet   On the sunny side of the street.We know, for instance, that much of the   An eerie order underneath even chaos, as if the finger of God,,   In order and disorder, is always there   I think he has nothing to support this..Talk to me -- tell me your dreams   Am I in them?.A sure thing, you can count, on..I hit the gas and I mashed past Inglewood   I think I drove through every single hood   South Central, Compton and Watts   Long Beach, bust a you, here come the cops   Wish I had a genie with about three wishes   Metal flake green on D's I look suspicious   You know that I'm running   Shit, I hear it humming   Fuck, I see it coming   Is it a bird?.Si es verdad que tu eres guapa   Yo te voy a poner gozar   Tu tiene la boca grande   Dale ponte a jugar, como?.From Mexico to New York..Since I'm putting down all of the true things around, but I like it   I handed down the crown, given the jewels and the answers of may   The thought of being ousted comes and goes   When I think about it the wind blows   I hate it      Run me out of town, somewhere a move might intended a gown at   Pissed at all the bowels, always the blues and a delicate smile   Missed all of the sideways, gull and noun   Chills and petty band-aids, wrapped around   I hate it      Good grief.Yeah!.Chorus:   Take me   Touch me   Won't you hold me close?.You must try thinking like a cloud sometime..I'm scared to death..Perversion   Slow death agonizing   Stab around the eyes   Flowing blood   Will take (something) pleasure   Eclipsing our reason   Whipping burn   In high imitation   Scream for an act in vein   All of these cuts   Bled out hopelessly   Now I'm an act of rage!"
"I'm writing this paper today to talk about cenorship of books, movies, music,etc. I think that there should only be certain things on the self that childern can see. If you walk into a store or video store there are so many different things that children are exposed to. They see things and then seeing them makes them think that kind of stuff is @CAPS1. I believe that there should be a very limited selection that children can see. Things that are inappopreite should not be visable to children. I think that things that are bad should be removed from the selves and placed some where else. Also the music on the radio is censored yes but it doesn't mean that people don't know what the words are. There are people that get affended by certain words and they are still on the radio, on @CAPS2, in books. They are everywhere. Things would be completely different if people would watch what they put in stuff. It makes people expecly children believe that certain things are @CAPS1 and they are not. We should have very strict rules on things like that so then nothing inapporpreite is shown to people making them believe it is all @CAPS1. There are rules now on things like that but it doesn't mean that underage children are still getting to see this kind of stuff. That's why I believe there is so much violence now because children are plating video games such as @CAPS5 of @CAPS6 and when they see shooting and stuff they think it's @CAPS1 and they grow up believing that. I am writing this paper today to ask of an article in the paper on stricter rules for these kinds of things and maybe it will start to make things such as violence less.I told you so.Tell me will I ever learn?.Caress me, undress me, fill me with desire   Do the kind of things to me that set my heart on fire      (repeat)      Hey you!.Chorus:   I take one step away   Then I find myself coming back to you   My one and only, one and only you...

"Everyone has their own opinion on censorship in libraries.I think that what libraries choose to put on their shelves should not be censored. Every human being does not have the same taste in what they read, listen to, look at, and watch. In todays generation everyone has their own opinon on censorship. I do not agree with censorship because not everyone likes the same things, has the same thoughts, has the same lifestyle, and wants to learn the same things.     Everyone is an individual and is different in their own way. If libraries wanted to censor what they put out not everyone would get to read, listen, and watch what they wanted. Having libraries censor things would make people feel left out. For example if the library only put out romance things, then what would the action lovers do ? A library is for anyone and everyone who goes to it. One specific type of person does not go to the library.     Everyone grows up in a different lifestyle. Children do not choose their parents. Some parents censor what their kids read and watch,and some do not. Kids who have parents that do not censor what they choose to get at the library might have differnt interests. Not everyone likes the same things.     In school most of the time everyone learns the basic information that is required. Outside of school there is so much more to learn. People can go to librarys' and learn about differnt things that they want to learn about. What people choose to study in their free time can range from drugs and sex to @CAPS1.If libraries censored what people can read, watch, listen to not everyone would get to learn extra information that they wanted to. Libraries can not censor  their materials!     I do not agree with libraries censoring what materials they choose to put out for the public.People are differnt and that is okay. If libraries choose to censor things then not everyone would have equal opprotunities. Parents can censor what their kids read if they want. Not every parents chooses to censor what their kids get at the library; therefore kids have different interests. Human beings do not always want to learn the same things. The librarys' who choose to censor what they put out is not letting everyone have a equal chance to learn. Please let people be who they want to be! Do not censor what libraries put out such as books, music, movies, and magazines.And I left for a life of my own..I fall over and over and over over over on you   I get ill, I get ill, I get ill,

little white farmhouse   She helped out by hoeing the corn and the beans   Sometimes she would stare at herself in a mirror   And any would say, there was much to admire   Every turn of the curve of her body was flawless   From pretty white teeth to her shiny blond hair   One day, as she stood by the road leading westward   In blue jeans and t-shirt and mail-order boots   The tractors and trailers and pick-ups, saw Linda   The drivers all slowed down to holler and hoot   They received, not a smile from miss Linda Bohannon   No bag and no brush did she hold in her hand   Just Linda Bohannon, a physical treasure   Stepped into a light-blue Mercedes Benz   And this is one of those times   That we wish we knew the missing parts to these stories   But this is all we know   She was missing a week and her parents were worried   She called Sunday morning and said, ""I'm okay""   Well, Bohannons don't talk much, but we found out later   She called from a movie star's house in L.A   She's home now and been here for six years or seven   She brought home a baby, a fine-looking lad   Well Bohannons don't talk much, and Linda don't either   And nobody told us a thing about his dad   Well she's pretty as ever and she works in a gift shop   Looks after her boy and she don't ask for help   She watches the re-runs of an old TV western   And the boy looks a lot like a re-run himself"
"I beleive it is wrong to remove books from library shelves even if they are found offensive. I have three reasons to support this statement. These reasons are knowledge, different sections of the library, and freedom. I will explain these reasons below but before I begin I would like to add that most people want to censor things that they fear.     If a book is removed from a shelf because someone finds it offensive then the next person who comes along looking for that book can not access it. How is that fair? In life there are many things that can offend people but thats life, you have to learn to let those things go. Everyone has a right to form their own views and oppinions on things, but they can not if they do not read other people's oppinions. Reading expands our vacabulary, at any age. Just because you do not like something does not mean someone else also can not like it. You have to give them a chance to form an oppionion.     Library's are everywhere. If you are concerned about your children finding books that you do not want them to see then take them to a library with sections. All libraries are broken down in sections. Keep your children in the 'children' section and there should not be any concerns in that area. Once your children get older allow them to roam the library and develope an oppinion on what types of books they enjoy most.      We live in @LOCATION1, which since founded has been all about freedom. Some people do not have the money to buy books, or internet, So these people rely on public libraries. If they look for books and can not find a subject that interests them they will not read. They could even be looking for a specific book and not be able to find it because it was taken off the shelf. There is also a religion conflict. There are many different versions of the @CAPS1 but, many different religions. People come from all backgrounds so if they do not beleive in the @CAPS1 do we take that off the shelves too?      In closing I would like to add that I can also see why people would want to censor certain things. However most of the things people do not like to see are things they fear. These people can not hide from reality, not everything in the world is good, so let's not pretend everything is perfect and do our best to contribute to the wellness of society. What better way than letting everyone read whatever they wish.Wisdom not pride, give innocence instead..So what do you think I am?.Well, come and break the door down..Chorus Repeats end   Nothing could change us, all alll...

"I believe that there should be a little censorship in libraries. There are some books out there that could be a little offensive and cause some problems, but I also believe that even if a book is insulting you shouldn't be able to hide it from others.     There are some books that have some pretty nasty stuff in them that you could find in a library. Since a library is public lots of people go in to get books. What is to stop a kid to getting to one of these books, or movies you can find in libraries? Do you really want a child to check something out that has violence, horrible language, and sexual innuedo? What can you do about this problem? You could censorship the books and hide them from the public, but that would cause another problem.     The idea of censorship might sound ok, but really it's not the right thing to do. Hiding things from the public just because it might have some bad things in it is a little over the top. If you are an adult and your in the mood to read something with a little violence in it you'd have to go somewhere else because someone just took that book away because it had some swear words that they don't find appropriate in books. Censorship would just make it harder for adults to find some books that they would want to read.     So what do you do if there is an offensive book on the shelf? Do you just leave it there, or take it away so no one can read it? You could just put age restrictions on the books. If someone underage wanted to check out the book, they would have to get permission from their parent. That way the book can stay on the shelf and be read by anyone.You really screwed my mind..She reminds me some of a blue eyed doll a strange look there in her eyes   Surprisingly quick with her movements like a woman who's learned to survive   She empties the ashtrays and passes the booze in a crude but professional style   And her facial contortions are painfully set in a look that resembles a smile   The small crowded bar roars loud its approval of some verbal blow that she's dealt   By telling a trucker from the Redball Express to have intercourse with himself   In my mind I can see her room the place where the woman lives   The rollers and the curlers and the old panty hose   And the ceiling that leaks like a sieve   And there's pictures of Merle and Johnny and June and Kennedy there with a flag   And a letter from home that she's read ten times and an old blue traveling bag   You know that man she loves ah he's puttin' her on   But no queen could love him more   And in her mind their ship will sail to a hundred exotic shores   Lord she'll get no pity from me no she's tough and she wouldn't care   But life is made up of wishes and dreams and she's had more than her share   As I sit here and drink and look for a song I think I just found me one   There's a difference in a fallen woman and one who is still hangin' on.Won't you descend from the throne, from where you sit?.Why do I just lie awake and think of you?.Did they speak out against Him, did they dare?.My world was no more than a dream   And waitin' on a dream can sure get lonely   Your love just fell right into place   And filled and empty space to overflowing, overflowing   My world begins with havin' a friend when I'm feeling blue   My world would end if ever I heard you say we were through   Just don't know what I'd do   'Cause my world begins and ends with you   Sometimes I tell little lies to see if your eyes are looking through me   But you know lying's not my style   I just need your smile coming to me   Reassuring me   My world begins with havin' a friend when I'm feeling blue   My world would end if ever I heard you say we were through   Just don't know what I'd do   'Cause my world begins and ends with you.I've seen that look on me a thousand times..Standing in the bathroom with a gun in my hand   Pulling on the trigger just as fast as I can   I can hear her scream as she reaches for the lover beside her   Married by the Bible, she was only sixteen      I was fresh from prison trying to follow my dream   Who'd ever thought I'd be the judge and the jury that tried her?.gotta get it while it's not   With a self-centered psychopath givin' a forget-me-not   Rape me, rape me everybody gets in line   With a long forked-tongue-kiss   Sucked away the rest of time

cathedral   Right down with the shadow of St. Mary's in the sky   And I'm just one of these late model children waiting for the king   Yeah, but there ain't no sign of Elvis in San Fransisco   It's

"People all judge things differently. Thats why I feel that libraries should keep those kinds of books. What @MONTH1 be found as a offenisve book to one person might not to another one. If there are people saying that the certain books are offensive, then they should take them out of the library. You shouldn't take one book out because one person thinks it is offensive.          What might be offensive to one person @MONTH1 interest another. The person that doesn't think it is, should have the right to read the book. That would be taking the rights for people away because a person finds it offensive. The person might find the book useful because they want to learn about the topic more. They will never get to learn about it if they take the book out because one person finds it offensive or doesn't like it.           I personally like watching movies or reading books that are thrilling and @MONTH1 have some violence in them. If the library took these books or movies out because a mother saw her son or daughter read or waching then it would be wrong. The mother would be taking away what I like to read and watch. Thats not fair at all. A way to solve this issue is to have certain areas for each type of age group; therefore, they would be watching or reading types of things acceptable for their age group.          I understand the fact that some people take things offensively. Also that they don't want their children to pick up a book or movie that isn't acceptable for their age group. They have to understand though that sometime people like those type of things, and they are taking it away from the people who enjoy them. It is like taking rights away from people because they don't agree with what is happening. It wouldn't be right at all to take those books out of the library.                     All people have different views about things. You can't change a thing if one person doesn't like it. People have rights to pick up a book if they want to or not. Not everyone is the same, so not all people are going to think the same way. I like things that some people might not like, that is just how human nature is.I go down..I know it's hard   In a world gone mad   To find the truth   To understand   And I know it's hard   To turn the page   To walk the line   To have the faith      But sometimes when it's light   And you can see   Sometimes when this world   Just seems to be so cold   Sometimes when you're lost at sea   Drowning in your pain   Sometimes the sun shines through the rain      I know it's hard   In a world so cold   To feel the love   I know it's hard   And I know it's true   That in the end   We all find our way   And that's life my friend      But sometimes when it's light   And you can see   Sometimes when this world   Just seems to be so cold   Sometimes when you're lost at sea   Drowning in your pain   Sometimes the sun shines through the rain      World keeps turning   Nothing changes   Hope this time   We can rearrange the stars   It can't be that hard no      Sometimes when it's light   And you can see   Sometimes when this world   Just seems to be so cold   Sometimes when you're lost at sea   Drowning in your pain   Sometimes the sun shines through the rain      Sometimes when it's light   And you can see   Sometimes when this world   Just seems to be so cold   Sometimes when you're lost at sea   Drowning in your pain   Sometimes the sun shines through the rain      Ooo let it shine   Shine through the rain   Ooo let it shine   Shine through the rain   Sometimes the sun shines through the rain   Don't you know it's gonna shine yea   Shining down on you   Sometimes the sun shines through the rain.Hoochie Woman   Hoochie Woman   Hoochie Woman   Hoochie Woman      I wasn't thinking   My head was in the book   His hands were on her everywhere   I saw his face I dropped my coffee   He's cheating on me with a Hoochie Woman      Ooo hoo hoo you can   Keep your Hoochie   Ooo hoo hoo   And the bank accounts   Cause boy I bring home the Bacon   I said boys I bring home the Bacon now      I went to work and the office girls   Were all burning their poetry   It wasn't good   But in the neighborhood   Now they're all just a   Hoochie Woman      He called me up   And said ""she has needs""   I said ""you'll find 'em   On Barney's fourth floor""   He said ""I need a loan""   (I said) ""that's not a problem   You better keep this from you   Hoochie Woman"".It was a teenage wedding, and the old folks wished them well   You could see that Pierre did truly love the mademoiselle   And now the young monsieur and madame have rung the chapel bell,   ""C'est la vie"", say the old folks, it goes to show you never can tell      They furnished off an apartment with a two room Roebuck sale   The coolerator was crammed with TV dinners and ginger ale,   But when Pierre found work, the little money comin' worked out well   ""C'est la vie"", say the old folks, it goes to show you never can tell      They had a hi-fi phono, boy, did they let it blast   Seven hundred little records, all rock, rhythm and jazz   But when the sun went down, the rapid tempo of the music fell   ""C'est la vie"", say the old folks, it goes to show you never can tell      They bought a souped-up jitney, 'twas a cherry red '53,   They drove it down to Orleans to celebrate the anniversary   It was there that Pierre was married to the lovely mademoiselle   ""C'est la vie"", say the old folks, it goes to show you never can tell.It's the fairies' revenge they say   And gumdrops and Saturdays did Eric call by the way      Ride on, ride on, ride on.I was the girl who was on fire   I was the girl who was on fire   Only a bird could get much higher   'Cuz I was the girl who was on fire.Now who's that babe with the fabulous shadow?.Oh, you should have run whilst you had time..And the Dawn will cry to the Valley On   DOMINION,   On DOMINION,   On DOMINION ..Yeah live and let live motherfuckers,   I'm a do me you do you..And who will write love songs for you ...

"Censorships in the libraris  would be liked cutting the worlds air supply. It would be taking away from a readers imagintion. stoping readers from being able to express their mind.      My veiw on censorship in the libraries would not be needed. Libraries around the world do good jobs keeping certain books in the apperpate ages levels. By removing certain materials out of libraries would cause reader attention to why their being removed. Then readers would demanded that we leave their books alone. Then fight for more books like those and then they would need censorships in libraries.      Books were made to keeping people wondering, learning, and excited. By cutting away different materials would be stopping people from enjoying the world of minds. More you take books away the more the population on watching television gets higher. Then there would be no more author and more actors and actress. People minds would not be wondering, learning or being kept excited.      I remember when i was a little girl i went to the library. I was in the library looking for a book. I wet to the big kids side as i called it and tried to check the book out. The library lady told me i was to young and showed me to my age level books and took the book back. Then i was able to check a book out.      So all i am sating is that censorships are not needed in libraries. That would be tking away from a librarains job. So dont take away readrs imagintion.Bye bye, pretty woman   I've got to leave you now   I find you never really cared      Stand back, take a look at you   You couldn't care if you wanted to   You keep saying it's gonna change   But every time it comes back again   It's a merry-go-round      Endless lies shine in your eyes      It's alright, count to ten   It will all be better then   It's alright, the world will go away      Stand back, take a look at you   You couldn't care if you wanted to   You keep saying it's gonna change   But every time it comes back again   It's a merry-go-round      Endless lies, I can see it in your eyes   The heartbreak is, if you could only see   That's not the way it's supposed to be   Endless tears that flowed through the years   You take it all, and then you take some more   Then you come running back to me      Play on, pretty music   Play on and on for me   Shine on, silver stars   Over the sea      Endless lies, I can see it in your eyes   The heartbreak is, if you could only see   That's not the way it's supposed to be      Endless lies shine in your eyes.Your weapon is guilt, your weapon is guilt, your weapon is guilt..Won't you come into my room, I want to show you all my wares..(I'm not afraid)   You'll never change   What's been and gone      'Cause all of the stars   Are fading away   Just try not to worry   You'll see them some day   Take what you need   And be on your way   And stop crying your heart out      'Cause all of the stars   Are fading away   Just try not to worry   You'll see them some day   Take what you need   And be on your way   And stop crying your heart out      We're all of us stars   We're fading away   Just try not to worry   You'll see us some day   Just take what you need   And be on your way   And stop crying your heart out   Stop crying your heart out   Stop crying your heart out   Stop crying your heart out.Yeah whew ooh oh yeah..Who was it who fell by the way?.Along came a spyder, picked up a rider,   Took him down the road to eternity..Come over here (what's your name?).I won't give up..It is called indoctrination   And it happens on all levels   But it has nothing to do with equality   It has nothing to do with democracy   And though it professes to   It has nothing to do with humanity   It is cold, hard and mechanical..I know this pain   Why do lock yourself up in these chains?.Won't say bye-bye bye-bye bye-bye bye-bye   'Til the night is gone..[Chorus:].Until it is just one trap   One threaded ?.But now that you and I are sharing a sigh   We know, yes, we know      And you will find, to give love a start   Don't think with your mind, just feel with your heart      Can anyone explain the wonder of love   No!.Well, did you ever ?.But life can chew you up and spit you out..And where you going that   You no longer belong here?.Time can't fix it fast enough,   So we won't notice what it was that went wrong   I saw something there much too familiar   A butterfly with a broken wing   She's fallen under, she's past the end,   Communication is down again   The scars have healed but they're back again   We've got to believe this man must bend   Because if you could you'd try and destroy her   And there we would be with nothing at all   Is it safe to be a man   When your tired and lonely   Only the confident know where to stand   Is it safe to be man   When the world is loaded with thousands   That can't figure out just what they did   Time can't fix it fast enough,   So we won't measure just how far below you kept pushing her   You'll have to pay back all of the years that you stole   She's walking backwards,   She's spun around her ears are ringing loud,   How does it feel, does it make you mad?.Who could your lover be?.Lets go      I wanna go to Ibiza (lets go)   I wanna go to Argentina (lets go)   Yeah I wanna go and dance (d-d-dance)   I wanna dance in Paris France (lets go)   I wanna go around the world (lets go)   And party with the girls (lets go)   And when I get there when I get there when I'm there I wanna go      I wanna go crazy!.Boy, take the time 'cause I have all night."
"I believe that indeed certian books sould not be on libraries shelves. And some people @MONTH1 feel the need to remove books of their choosing but, I also say that if the library sees it fit to put such books on their shelves that is their problem. I believe that if you do not like the books then stay away from them. Now if the books are only meant to be seen by adult eyes then, yes by all means remove them. I personally know parents that would not allow their childern to need a book just because in the review they read the main characters kissed. I find it rediculous, but that is the way they parent their kids. And as long as they dont take it upon themselves to force they parenting methods on to libraries and other learning places just because of the books I am fine with it.      I find that some people see books on slavery and the holocost and such topics to be offensive. I see those books as our history, those topics are taught to us in school and we will most likely hear about such things as we grow up. What is the difference between learning about them now and learning about them as a adult? People seem to be trying to shield the world from thing like swear words. Why? If a book has a few curse words oh well, tell your kids to stay away from it if you think its bad. But, do not take it upon yourself to remove that book from our library. People have different views, we always have and we always will. If a parent feels so strongly about a few books get a postition and get signatures saying that these books should be removed or atleast moved to a different part of the library. Do not force your thoughts on some one else.As you sit there in your loneliness,   Confused as you must be..The longer I look at you   The fairer you become   Every time I hear your voice   Sweeter is the song      Each glanced borrowed from your eyes   Deeper is the story   Wind burns your sleeping breath   And waters become one..Are you down now   (Are ya's down now)      [Chorus]   You want to get paid?.Chasing shadows, over my walls   with myself hardly sleeping   Dwarfs and giants, twenty feet tall   fill the room with their creeping      Sounds of breathing sharpen my ears   then they fade into nothing   Someone's laughter out in the street   fills the night with their loving      I feel the ice in my head   Running its hands through my bed   Not even dreaming I seem to be dead   Colours of yellow and colours of red      All I'm asking some secret voice   Is to lead me to darkness      I'm so tired, dawn never comes   I just hide in the shadows.But why does it have to be?.It

"I do belive that certain stuff should be removed from the libraries like stuff that little kids should not be able to see. They should be in the other room to where you have to have like a id to get in. They should make sure about this cause you dont want your little son looking at like playboy. I know i dont.     Little kids should not be reading books with alot of swearing and evrything cause no kid needs to act like that. It bothers them they could get in trouble with school and at home.     Yes it @MONTH1 be true that adults like to read about sex, and drugs but do we really want our kids reading the same stuff that we read. Some people just need to think about what they just leaving out in the librarys because little kids loves to see new stuff all the time.     So next time you working at the library or just there vistiing you might wanna watch where you put stuff at cause little kids will see it..Ooh, bottoms up..Summer comes laughing to Strawberry Farms

"There are so many books and magazines, music, and movies to be discovered in this world. Some are funny, sad, wierd, scary, etc. And then there are some that are questionable to others on wheather it was even nessecary to even put the the material on the shelf of a library in the first place. I for one am not one of those people who would question a book, magazine, movie or music. I believe that everyone's voice needs to be heard somehow and if we all take a voice away that we do not like, then we will lose a lot of voices.     We are all entitled to our own opinion. When it comes to some things some are more opinionated than other, but in the end we all have something that we feel strongly about. There are some people who want to express their feelings with the whole world with people that understand and agree with what they feel. If we take that away from people, then how will we all connect? Some things @MONTH1 come across as offensive to others, but who has the right to say that something should not be shared with the rest of the world. I have observed that when people have the same interests in things like music, books, or movies then it gives people a way to come together and talk about something. I have witnessed at concerts everybody seems to connect because we are all there for the same reason, to see the band or person that we all like to listen to. Everybodys different and likes to have their own personal preference on something. Like Katherine Paterson once said, 'But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf-that work I abhor-then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' I think she was trying to say that if we all take a book off the shelf that we do not think should be on there, then there is going to be nothing left for anybody to read. Then what will we do?      Theres such a variety of materials that are needed to be discovered wheather it is a book, music, or movie everyone has their own special type that they enjoy. I do not think that censorship is a good idea for any sort of material on a shelf. Theses materials are what keep people connected with each other. I think it is very important to not censor anything because it does not just give the writer a voice, it give a voice for the people that agree with the material of the book, movie, or music.Tsch..Here in the light   It burns you up inside   Here in the shell of a sun   We echo on      Too much listening   Not enough living      [Chorus]   And you say   What did I say   What did you say   We just   Go away   Go away   Go away      It helps you out   Knowing I'm left out   Locked in a box with a light   That won't shine      Turn it on and wait for   Someone to come      [Chorus]      I'm here now   Waiting   Holding on to reasons   Wasted   I faced it   Watching you deny me      Here in the light   It burns you out sometimes   Here in the shell of a sun   We echo on      Left alone forever   All alone together      [Chorus].It isn't over   Can't you smell the fear?.I have to get to bed by nine,   Rub on a tube of Ben-gay..Hear me can you hear me?.You're so young   But your feelings are deep   And how do I make you   How do I make you   How do I make you feel for me      You put your head on my pillow   And you're fast asleep   And how do I make you   How do I make you   How do I make you   Dream about me?.I don't give a damn      Mama I'm leavin' way from home to join the circus   And papa I go into that place where them clowns get down (get down)   Sister I know that there are lions tigers and bears   I'll be safe and sure to call y'all when I get there      [Chorus]   Nothing but the greatest show on earth   (shut up while I'm singing) step right up step right up come one come all   What u want what you need   Wanna drank wanna chief   I got it yeah I got it      Mama I'm moving up and I'll be selling cotton candy   And papa next week they'll let me sit on the trapeze   Uncle you should see all these dancing girls   And every night I get to sleep under the big top      [Chorus]      [Macy Gray]   Ain't nothing like, great   It's the greatest show on earth   What u want what u need   Wanna drank wanna chief   I, I got it hey I got it      [Bridge]   Oh oh oh oh oh whoa   Yeah yeah oh yeah   Oh oh yeah yeah      [Chorus]      OK OK OK OK OK   I got good love   I got true love   I got green love   I got blue love   I got dark love   I got light love   I got white love   I got Chinese love   I got plaid love   I got stripeded love      What you clapping for I ain't done yet.Isabella, all is knowing..Go!.If I heard of a house on fire,   I'd rush over and be a quick cash buyer..do it hurt?.With my ego in my gut   My babbling mouth would wash it up   (But now I've started learning how)   I keep it shut      My door was never locked   Until one day a trigger come, cocking   (But now I've started learning how)   I keep it shut      Wide eyes would clean and dust   Things that decay, things that rust   (But now I've started learning how)   I keep 'em shut   I keep 'em shut      Harm is in us   Harm is in us, but power to arm   Harm is in us   Harm in us, but power to arm   Harm is in us   (""Leave it open!"").Oh girl   Julie!.Papa Legba,   To the city of camps..Have you heard the news?.Yonder go Huck, minus pocket-watch an' wallet gone   Skin shrink-wraps his skeleton   No wonder he gets thinner, what with his cold'n'skinny dinners!.One word, that's all was said,   Something in your voice called me, caused me to turn my head....And I can see him dance away now....I'm coming   Whoa, yeah      I'm running,   Finding my way back home   I'm coming   Ooh, babe, I said I'm running   Whoa, babe, I said I'm coming   To get you, mama   Said I'm running      Ooh, babe, I said I'm coming   For you, babe   I said I'm running   Ooh yes, babe, I said I'm coming   To get you, babe..What's a dad for dad?.Your whisper tells a secret   Your laughter brings me joy   And a wonder of feeling I'm nature's own little boy   But still the tears keep falling   They're raining from the sky   Well there's a lot of me got to go under before I get high      Don't you let the sun disappear   Don't you let the sun disappear   Don't you let the sun be leaving   No, you can't be leaving my life   Say that you won't be leaving my life   Say that you won't be leaving my life   Say won't you please, stay won't you please   Say won't you please, stay won't you please   Lord, won't you come and get into my life   Lord, won't you come and get into my life   Say won't you please, stay won't you please   Say won't you please, stay won't you please   Oh Lord, don't go      And even when the song is over   Where have I been, was it just a dream?"
"Offensive media is everywhere. From books to music lyrics, our culture embraces us with it. Children that see inappropriate media can pick up bad behavior. This can then lead to a child having a hard time associating with his peers. Adults are also affected by inappropriate media if they see their favorite celebrity or  any other role model use inappropriate behavior. This could make an adult emotionally unhealthy and they @MONTH1 become violent or depressed. Finally, our world could be better if offensive media were abolished altogether. People's lives could be enriched with good, clean entertainment instead of being corrupted with inappropriate media. One can clearly see that offensive media must be pulled from our country's libraries immediatley.     Inappropriate media is surrounding us daily, including children. What children see they imitate, even in the first couple years of their lives. So if they hear a swear word on t.v or see someone doing drugs, they @MONTH1 imitate it. Clearly this is inappropriate behavior for a child. If the child is exposed to inappropriate media, for a long period of time, they @MONTH1 think that it is ok to use it in everyday life. Their social skills and mind is being corrupted because of offensive media. Libraries should pull inappropriate media off of their shelves because it can corrupt a child's mind.      Another reason why  libraries should pull off offensive media is because adults can pick up different offensive habits as well. Just as children can pick up the offensive habit of swearing , so can adults if they are exposed to it for a long period of time. Besides swearing, adults can also think that killing someone is ok because they saw it in a movie. They could then pick up a violent weapon and try to kill someone if they are angry. This is not a healthy way to express your feelings towards someone if they are making you angry. Our country's libraries should pull off inappropriate media from their shelves because it can turn adults into being emotionally unhealthy.      Finally , inappropriate media should be pulled off library shelves because our world could be a better place without it. Media is one of the root causes of why people act the way they do. If they see their favorite celebrity getting arrested for a @CAPS1  in a magazine, they @MONTH1 think that it is ok to drink and drive. Another example is if people read about someone doing drugs in a book, they @MONTH1 want to try and experiment with drugs  themselves. This can lead to people doing crazy things that can be harmful to other lives around them.      Offensive media is almost anywhere. When children see inappropriate media , they @MONTH1 think that it is ok to imitate it. Adults, when exposed to enough offensive media, can pick up nasty habits like swearing, killing or doing drugs which , inturn , can lead to to being emotionally unhealthy. With out inappropriate media on our library shelves, our world would be a better place. We would have less conflict, less deaths ,and better lives that are enriched, not corrupted , with quality media. Millions of lives could be made better if libraries pulled off inappropriate media from their shelves.Love, can't you see I'm alone   Can't you give this fool a chance   A little love is all I ask   A little kindness in the night      Please don't leave me behind   No, don't tell me love is blind   A little love is all I ask   And that is all      Ooh love, I've been searchin' so long   I've been searchin' high and low   And little love is all I ask   A little sadness when you go      Maybe you'll need a friend   Only please don't let's pretend   A little love is all I ask   And that is all      I wanna spread my wings   But I just can't fly   As a string of pearls   The pretty girls go sailin' by      Ocean deep   I'm so afraid to show my feelings   I have sailed a million ceilings   Solitary room      Ocean deep   Will I ever find a lover   Maybe she has found another   And as I cry myself to sleep   I know this love of mine I'll keep   Ocean deep      Now, can't you hear when I call   Can't you hear a word I say   A little love is all I ask   A little feelin' when we touch      Why am I still alone   I've got a heart without a home   A little love is all I ask   And that is all      I wanna spread my wings   But I just can't fly   As a string of pearls   The pretty girls go sailin' by      Ocean deep   I'm so afraid to show my feelings   I have sailed a million ceilings   Solitary room      Ocean deep   Will I ever find a lover   Maybe she has found another   And as I cry myself to sleep   I know this love of mine I'll keep   Ocean deep      I'm so lonely, lonely, lonely (Ocean deep)   On my own in my room   I'm so lonely   (Ocean deep)   I'm so lonely, I'm so lonely   This love of mine   I'll be ocean deep   I'm so lonely, lonely, lonely   In my room.(Put your hands up!).Des was ie der vater geselle   Und der geist, den niemen mac   Sunder scheiden: est al ein,   Sleht und ebener danne ein zein,   Als er Abrahme erschein....Pictures of an image of a person who could not be blamed   You are a colour and you are a number   We need a sanction to see one another   If I keep my distance in the season of this slender hell   It's because of the need to live off one another   Go home young offender and stay undercover      We're busy running out of time   (Whatever it takes, I will make you mine)   I'll take the future from your hands   (All the things I've ever had, I can make the perfect crime)      We're strong, we do our thing   Let the world cry, watch the birds sing   Give me the freedom, I need to recover   Words cannot heal, when a line is your lover      Wind howls in my chamber like an angel   (like an angel)   You are a colour and you are a number   Go home young offender and stay undercover.While window shopping through the past   I ran across a looking glass   Reflecting moments remaining in a burned out light   Tragic magic prayers of passion   Stay the same through changing fashions   They freeze my mind like water on a winter's night   Spent most of my youth   Out hobo cruising   And all I got for proof   Is rocks in my pockets and dirt in my shoes   So goodbye nonbeliever   Don't you know that I hate to leave here   So long babe, I got the flashback blues   Photographs show the laughs   Recorded in between the bad times   Happy sailors dancing on a sinking ship   Cloudy skies and dead fruit flies   Waving goodbye with tears in my eyes   Well, sure I made it but ya know it was as hell of a trip   Spent most of my youth   Out hobo cruising   And all I got for proof   Is rocks in my pockets and dirt in my shoes   And ten times what it grieves you   That's how much more I hate to leave you now   So long babe, I got the flashback blues   Spent most of my youth   Out hobo cruising   And all I got for proof   Is rocks in my pockets and dirt in my shoes   So goodbye nonbeliever   Don't you know that I hate to leave here   So long babe, I got the flashback blues.Hey, come on, honey   You won't have along wait for me, baby   I'll be there in just a little while   You see, I gotta go out in this car with these people and...

"Should books, magazines, or movies that are found offensive be removed from the shelves? I think that the book, magazine, or movie should stay on the shelf even if it is found offensive. If it is offensive to one person, it doesn't mean that it is to every person. Everyone has their own view on the subject of offensive or not.     I don't think the person that wrote the book or magazine meant for it to be offensive. They were just writing what they thought went along with the story and some people took offense from the book or magazine. But, they shouldn't argue over it because, like I said before, the author probably didn't mean for it to be offensive.     In conclusion, the books should stay on the shelves. Everyone has different point of view. The author probably didnt mean for the book or magazine to be offensive..What's that sound I hear coming from the ground   That' going 'round and 'round I can feel it pull me down   On my knees tears of joy have come to me   As the flower sounds made it plain to see      That this world is a perfect place to live   There is a warm soft wind blowing 'round me just to give   All the leaves such a haunting melody   That forever will be a part of me      Just like a ship out on the sea   Floating alone no one around me or beyond me   The sun is on me      Then suddenly I felt a kiss out of the breeze   That did caress me and possess me   Oh it astounds me      All around there's a feeling in the air   That with the grace of time we'll be getting closer there   But day by day I can see they walk away   And I wonder, Lord will they ever know      That this world is a perfect place to live?.Just the other day-   I heard you walked out on her   Just the other day-   I heard it's not forever   You say, anyway-   You said it's not like before   Just the other day-   Did she let you go   Did she let you go..No-one could take us..If it ain't real, fake it!.The first time I looked in your eyes I knew   That I would do anything for you   The first time you touched my face I felt   What I'd never felt with anyone else      I want to give back, what you've given to me   And I want to witness all of your dreams   Now that you've shown me who I really am   I want to be more than just your man      I want to be the wind that fills your sails   And be the hand that lifts your veil

" I don't think that they should be removed from the shelfs. Everyone has a right to read it at some point in time. To were no little kids can rent the book. If they are complaining about how it's volgar or sexual. Then you shouldn't take it away. Try something else such as an adult section. One person @MONTH1 love a book that has some violence in it and on the other hand you @MONTH1 have a person who is real religous and can't stand to see it.      There are very many view points of this topic. The parents who don't want their kids to be exposed to this type of life style. Some people don't really think about it being as bad as the next person. If it's a book you dislike on a book shelf and you don't like it put out in plain sight. Should you really be the one to make the decision on who takes it down?     Some people don't know what their kids like to read. If they have the final thought on what gets taken down it @MONTH1 affect the kids reading habbits. What if your kid wants to read a horror book and you choose not to let those kinds of books on the shelf any more. Then they don't want to read the books that are left up on the shelf. I'd rather read a book that interests me than a book that I dislike.     My point of view on this topic is simple. I don't think the parents should be in controle of what we read as long as it's appropriate. I think the decision should be left for the government to say which book should and shouldn't be taken away..I can see the mountains..I got dem bands   Ooh mr..There's two things I know for sure   She was sent here from heaven and she's Daddy's Little Girl   As I drop to my knees by her bed at night   She talks to Jesus and I close my eyes   And I thank God for all of the joy in my life   Oh, but most of all         For butterfly kisses after bedtime prayer   Sticking little white flowers all up in her hair   ""Walk beside the pony, Daddy,   It's my first ride""   ""I know the cake looks funny, Daddy,   But I sure tried""   Oh, with all that I've done wrong, I must have done something right   To deserve a hug every morning and butterfly kisses at night         Sweet sixteen today   She's looking like her momma a little more every day   One part woman, the other part girl   To perfume and make-up, from ribbons and curls   Trying her wings out in a great big world   But I remember         Butterfly kisses after bedtime prayer   Sticking little white flowers all up in her hair   ""You know how much I love you, Daddy,   But if you don't mind,   I'm only gonna kiss you on the cheek this time""   Oh, with all that I've done wrong, I must have done something right   To deserve her love every morning and butterfly kisses at night         All the precious time   Oh, like the wind the years go by   Precious butterfly   Spread your wings and fly         She'll change her name today   She'll make a promise and I'll give her away   Standing in the brideroom just staring at her   She asks me what I'm thinking and I said ""I'm not sure -   I just feel like I'm losing my baby girl""   Then she leaned over and gave me         Butterfly kisses with her momma there   Stickin' little white flowers all up in her hair   ""Walk me down the aisle, Daddy,   It's just about time""   ""Does my wedding gown look pretty, Daddy?.If I could only do it all again...

"My thoughts on censorship in libraries is yes some books, music, movies, magazines, and etc., should be taken off of the shelves if they are offensive. If they are left on the shelves some very small child or teens could come up and reach for a book and find that it has bad things in it that are ment for adults. The child will ask the caregiver that they are with '@CAPS1 does this picture mean?', and they will most likely not know @CAPS1 to say at that moment. Parents and caregivers are not always up to explaining or want to explain as soon as they have to about things sometimes. Everyone goes through life with different things they have to learn at different rates. Somethings should be taught when we young like how to brush our teeth, but somethings should be left until we are older like having babies or drinking.           When parents going through the explaination of something like making babies you do not want it to be when they are only five years old. With books in a library with pictures of men and women questions like that do get asked to young. Libraries are public places and should be safe for any age no matter whether they are young babies or adults. Public schools have libraries in them also, and i would not want a child reading a @CAPS2 or @CAPS3 book with bad or offensive things in it. It does not just have to be a book with bad things in it, but it could also be something to do with religions. Everyone has their thoughts and comments on at least one religion. If you have grown up a @CAPS4 your whole life, and a kid picks up a book dealing with jews they will ask someone about it.      Young kids and teens can always find things that they should notat certain ages, but why not make it less by not letting a library be censorshiped? When you were younger your parent did not want to take you to the library and be asked an offensive question because of a book, music, movie, or magazine. It has worked for so many years, so we should not have to change it now..Now that was great, please thank the band for playing that song..There's a well on the hill,   You just can't kill for Jesus,

"Libraies should not be able to remove books, movies, and  magizines off the shelves just because some kids might be offended. If the town libraries and school libraries took out the cool movies, magizines, and books that most kids love to read and watch then the kids that like those books , movies, and magizines would not return to the library any more.           For example, I like to listen to hard rock, heavy metal, and rap. But, the people that go to church just like to listen to church music. If your with your friend one night because he invited you to come to church with him and you pull in the parking lot listening to your rap music some people @MONTH1 not like it. This doesn't mean that they should take the things people don't like off the shelves in order to satisfy them.          Libraries should have a policy stating that if a child should check out a book or magizine or rent a movie, that they should have the childs parents sign and return a permission slip stating that their child has their permission to rent this book, magizine, or movie. Libraries should have an age limint to check out books and magizines. If kids would want to rent a movie then they would have to have a permission slip signed by their parents and returned.

"They need to remove the bookstors because all studeds wants that the library have many books like spanish books or the diffrent culture, and the students can knows diffrent languges or that they can do many this with that books.  Like example they can read load and also they can do the same book with others words.                                                                                      And also the music and movies they need to remove because     some dvds are spokeds thats they need to remove.      For example librarys in the world that the need to borrow somes books for many people took, and the people can takes the book without pay nothing, thats the people want that the librarys are free.  Also the librarys need to spants with many parts in the world that many people think that did's great idea because many people said no because the librarys can't not borrow a books or dvds,  magazines, etc.   Thats why the librarys need that the people know that the   librarys not borrows books thats happed in the world....  I think the librarys need to do is go with the people and show what they have in the library and borrow books dvds thats the people want too... sometimes the library can rent the dvds that are interesting that the people can't find in the other place, like movies new but if the library not have the dvds somes people can go to the library and give to the bookstor that you can find in the other place. would we have to read more like many people do thats great idea. And the library need more style for the people are excited and take the books and read..No substitution for restitution, the only solution for peace   Is increasing the height of your spirituality..Whadd'ya At?.Yeah, you say that all the time   And you mean it only sometimes   Are you out in all that sunshine   Waiting to derail   Wanting needing fighting feeling   Waiting to derail   Needing wanting feeling fighting   Waiting to derail   Yeah, you say that only sometimes   But you mean it all the same   Are you out in all that sunshine   Just waiting to derail   Wanting needing feeling wanting   Waiting to derail   Wanting changing   Do you feel it?.Baby I go, hard so hard, sometimes it's hard to tell whether not I'm even on my job   Most of the time I'm running 'round, either that or I'm gone   Some of these people hating, but we don't see 'em at all 'cause we done made it, too far   Got something to say then fuck 'em ain't trying to lose out on all of this for nothing   I'm usually just balling and shit, whatever I want, I'ma get   No time to count the money that I got because all of it's getting spent   And all of my niggas grind so all of us getting rich   And most of these niggas fly but all of 'em ain't the shit   That's why you holding me down, been doing it ever since   Only one I wanna be 'round and counting up all these chips, wit'      Whatever you want boy, I got it, got it   Got everything you need, ain't no doubt about it   I'm everywhere you be, I can't see you without me   Got everything you need, ain't no doubt about it      Whatever you want boy, I got it, got it   Got everything you need, ain't no doubt about it   I'm everywhere you be, I can't see you without me   Got everything you need, ain't no doubt about it (got everything)      And I, swear you deserve a wedding ring   Can't ever see you choosing nothing over instead of me   Won't ever leave you, you're the one I need so that's how I'm gonna treat you   Take you places where they using different language to greet you   Smile and shake when they meet you   Lot of cake but you got a lot of love from me and when I'm home, you can't get enough of me   'Cause even when we both tired, you still put up with me   Ain't going nowhere for sure, feel like you stuck with me   Swear I feel lucky, I get anything I want   And if I need it then you got it, if I say it then you trust me   Don't see you much but when I do, I need your love and I'ma need it in a rush      Whatever you want boy, I got it, got it   Got everything you need, ain't no doubt about it   I'm everywhere you be, I can't see you without me   Got everything you need, ain't no doubt about it      Whatever you want boy, I got it, got it   Got everything you need, ain't no doubt about it   I'm everywhere you be, I can't see you without me   Got everything you need, ain't no doubt about it      Baby I can't break you heart, make you wait no more   Anytime you need me, I'll be right there for sure   You don't even have to call me, just say my name   I'll be right there waiting for you      Whatever you want boy, I got it, got it   Got everything you need, ain't no doubt about it   I'm everywhere you be, I can't see you without me   Got everything you need, ain't no doubt about it      Whatever you want boy, I got it, got it   Got everything you need, ain't no doubt about it   I'm everywhere you be, I can't see you without me   Got everything you need, ain't no doubt about it      Whatever you want boy, I got it, got it   Got everything you need, ain't no doubt about it   I'm everywhere you be, I can't see you without me   Got everything you need, ain't no doubt about it      Whatever you want boy, I got it, got it   Got everything you need, ain't no doubt about it   I'm everywhere you be, I can't see you without me   Got everything you need, ain't no doubt about it (got everything).When it came to a superstar,   Jenny was a bragger,   She spread it around to everyone in town   that she made it with Mick Jagger   Oh -

"Censorship is important. Especially pertaining to what books, magazines, movies, and music almost all people are reading, watching, and listening to. Some of the media such as books and magazines and such in libraries everywhere can be highly offensive to certain people or can send off the wrong message to children and teens. So, should we take them off the shelves?     I personally think no, most media aspects that are on the shelves in libraries can be very offensive to people, but alot of it has to do with people's opinions. The readers are the ones that are claiming that the books and other media aspects in libraries are offensive. The authors and directors and singers just do what they do, and the judgement and opinions all come from the people, fans, and critics. We shouldn't be taking it all off library shelves just because it is offensive to some people.     This leads back to the quote from Katherine Paterson when she states: 'And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' We can't take everything off the shelves because everyone's opinions are different so if we censor everything, there won't be anything left. Right now, they are doing a good job with censoring everything such as putting a rating on video games, and movies. Rated @CAPS1 movies are known to be for adult watchers and same goes for video games. Music they play on the radio is censored of all the foul language, so they make an effort. That leaves people the choice to watch, listen, or read the things they want, and they have to know beforehand that it might offend them. Although sometimes people think censoring those media aspects is not enough censorship, that's about all that can be done to not offend others. By taking everything off the shelves because of people's opinions, it could potentially make someone else angry or them being lacked of the things they want to read or watch. Censorship can be wholesome without removing all media off the shelves and in the world.I-M-N-O-T-H-I-N   I-M-N-O-T-H-I-N      I'm nothing'   I'm nothin'   Are you a republican or a democrat   A

"@NUM1ed     The censorship of certain media is such a controversial topic. Whether a certain piece of material is considered offensive and should be censored or not is more often opinionated rather than logically opposed, because it really does all come down to someone's opinion on this matter. It is too difficult for most people to step in someone else's shoes or be persuaded from a viewpoint different from their own or even escape pressures from the general public to consider something else. Things get censored for a lot of reasons, too! Sometimes they're just so intentionally offensive that perhaps the author or producer wants it to be censored or would appreciate the controversy, or that a new view or opinion is so radical and against a majority of the population that it is just considered offensive for being so different. Well, when does someone have a right to take a song off the air or pull a book permanently from a shelf?     The first thing that needs to be contemplated is if something is offensive or not. There are extremes to pieces of media where one sometimes must ask, '@CAPS1 were they thinking when they made that?' A movie being so outrageously graphic or violent is a fine example (although the same thing can happen in books, just with words instead of pictures). At the same time though, whether or not something you might think as unnecessary gore in a film might just be @CAPS1 I'm excited to see when I go to the cinema - it's all opinionated!          Another interesting thought is that somebody might come up with a revolutionary, radical scientific theory and write a whole novel or film a documentary explaining it all, but certain groups of people might claim that it is offensive to them. However, we might investigate into that theory ourselves and not be offended in the slightest. This is understandable though, people grow up in an environment that has its own set of ethics and principles, and people will honestly believe them and probably stick with those fundamentals throughout their lifetime. If you go against someone's beliefs that they hold so dear like that, they would of course be offensive to them. Does that mean that the something should be censored just because it offends a couple of groups in a population?     Whether or not something is to be torn from the access of the public is left up to the opinions of the general public themselves. The opinion of the public is created by the current time, trends, ethics, and problems that are going on. When something goes against too many of those things, people get upset. If most people are upset by something, it will probably start disappearing from sight. It's bad for business, and libraries are losing customers already due to most people not having an urge to read anymore with all of the stuff that you can do otherwise. Certain things can just put a bad taste in your mouth, and if someone gets that too often when they go to a library, they probably won't go there anymore.     So when it comes down to censorship in libraries, or anywhere, its just a bunch of opinions. If the general public does not like something, it will stop showing up. Certain books or other pieces of media are asking for the controversy that many subjects bring, while others are just unintentionally going against certain groups of people. People's beliefs are determined by where they grew up and when, and they'll hold on to those things for their lifetime. If something goes against those, people will be offended, and if enough people are upset, it gets taken away.When you look down from your throne I wonder what is it exactly that you see that keeps someone like you so patient with someone like me      I'm free!.To air, to air, to air,   To where you can go..Nobody understands   Except the toys in my hands   So now you listen   'Cause I'm omniscient      Hey look at me lady   I'm just a little baby   If I smile, then you smile   Then I'll get mad for awhile      I melt in your mouth   And in your hands whenever I can   But I really do nothing   Except kickin' and fussin'      I like to make a mess   I laugh at your distress   I sit all day in my crib   Absorbing all you give      I'm helpless   I'm flawless   I'm a machine   Give me, I need my toys      Keep me hot   Keep me strong   Keep me everlong   So now you listen      'Cause I'm omniscient.ooh, ooh, ooh   You're hypnotic when you touch   Your hypnosis is too much   And you burn me with your hypnotistic fire   You're hypnotic when you feel   Your hypnosis is too real   And I hope you're not a hypnotistic liar   You captured me, I fell for you   Now I've got nothing left to lose   You walked on me, I let you do   Whatever you must put me through   Put me through, now what have I done to you?.I gotta run..A distant alarm, a sound from far away   We raised our heads towards the sky but there was nothing there to see   The restless crowd is now breaking the silence   Anxiety is rising, the sky is turning dark   A riot is emerging, men beat men to death   This is unexplainable, a fight without a battle   The alarm resounds and someone called in a speaker:   ""This is not a drill, I repeat: this is not a drill...""

"People believe that censorship is impotant in Libraries. They believe that things should not be released if they have a bad subject matter. They feel that it is sending a bad message to children and teaching them horrible things to do and say. I disagree with them on this and these are the reasons why.     I feel that books/music/movies/magazines shouldn't be taken off the shelf is they have cuss words inside, i feel that they should continue to sell them even if they have bad words inside. I feel this way because there are alot of horrible things in this world. Children have to learn that, and i feel like cussing or anything of that subject matter isnt that big of a deal there is so much more to worry about then a couple of bad words children read and listen to. I listen to music that has cuss words on the inside and i also read books with bad words and it doesnt infulence me in any kind of way. So we shouldn't always try to control every one we should just let them be on the shelfs and let them or there parents decide if it's innaporpate or not.in conclusion i feel again that they should be on the shelfs and people should be allowed to listen/read whatever they want to. if it doesnt harm anyone or themselfs then let it go on and happen. let them do what they want to.We go on hurting each other   We go on hurting each other   Making each other cry   Hurting each other   Without ever knowing why..When I was young I'd listen to the radio   Waitin' for my favorite songs   When they played I'd sing along   It made me smile   Those were such happy times and not so long ago   How I wondered where they'd gone   But they're back again just like a long lost friend   All the songs I loved so well   Every sha-la-la-la   Every wo-o-wo-o still shines   Every shing-a-ling-a-ling   That they're startin' to sing's so fine   When they get to the part   Where he's breakin' her heart   It can really make me cry just like before   It's yesterday once more   Lookin' back on how it was in years gone by   And the good times that I had   Makes today seem rather sad   So much has changed   It was songs of love that I would sing to then   And I'd memorize each word   Those old melodies still sound so good to me   As they melt the years away   Every sha-la-la-la   Every wo-o-wo-o still shines   Every shing-a-ling-a-ling   That they're startin' to sing's so fine   All my best memories   Come back clearly to me   Some can even make me cry just like before   It's yesterday once more   Every sha-la-la-la   Every wo-o-wo-o still shines   Every shing-a-ling-a-ling   That they're startin' to sing's so fine   Every sha-la-la-la   Every wo-o-wo-o still shines   Every

"I do not think that books should be taken off shelves just because it's offensive or because others don't like it. If everyone took the books, music, and movies off the shelves that they didn't like, then all that would be left would be empty bookshelves.     I believe that the library was a right to keep whatever they want on the shelves. Some @MONTH1 say that the library has inapproprite books to check out, or they don't want their kids to pick up a book they don't like and read it. I think that's why the library has the shelves marked in sections for example, adult, young adult, children, and referance.      I've never seen a book that was offensive to me in a libray, which brings me to another point. Everyone has a opinion, if a book is offensive to you it might not be offensive to someone else. For example say that you saw a book on animal mating and you thought it was a bad book for the libary to have because, little kids might pick it up. Well that is your opinion because, if a biology teacher seen a book like that then they might want to check it out.      Another thing is that the library has certain book for a reason. Say that there is a book in the library that is about slaves, this book might be offensive to @CAPS1 @CAPS2 but, this book is there to inform people about slavery. What is offensive to some isn't offensive to others.     In conclusion, I believe that books should not be taken off library shelves just because it is offensive to you. Everyone just has to remember that people have their own opinions about things and you just have to deal with it. That's why I think that books should not be tooken off shelves.I like pie!.Jigsaw - Puzzle   Jigsaw - Puzzle      Your love is like a maze   I can't get through to you   You keep me in a daze   What's a girl to do with you?.I said can I take you home, where we can be alone,   Next we were movin' on and he was with me, yeah me,   And we'll movin' on and singin' that same old song,   Yeah with me - singin'      I love rock'n'roll   So put another dime in the juke box, baby..There ain't no time,   No time for sorrow..Go sister, roll on it   Don't let the music stop   Girl gon' make that Boongie drop      Go sister, roll on it   Go sister, roll on it   Don't let the music stop   Girl gon make that Boongie drop   Go sister, roll on it      Late night the speaker's pumpin'   Flesh-to-flesh, grind-n-bumpin'   Hot pants, green and yellow   Round thighs, feeling mellow   The beat of the ghetto   Corn rows, bees and Afros   the deed buzz from Nassau   I'd love to show the night      Go sister, roll on it   Don't let the music stop   Girl gon' make that Boongie drop      Go sister, roll on it   Go sister, roll on it   Don't let the music stop   Girl gon' make that Boongie drop   Go sister, roll on it      Gonna make that Boongie drop   Gonna make that Boongie drop   Gonna make that Boongie drop   Gonna make that Boongie drop      Black heat fills the dance hall   Lovebirds got the back wall   Junglers boot like labels   High heels on the tables   Bare feet on the dirt floor   No one cares if you're poor   every lock in the door   ain't coming home tonight      Go sister, roll on it   Don't let the music stop   Girl gon' make that Boongie drop      Go sister, roll on it   Go sister, roll on it   Don't let the music stop   Girl gon' make that Boongie drop   Go sister, roll on it      Gonna make that Boongie drop   Gonna make that Boongie drop, uh   Gonna make that Boongie drop   put the kids to sleep on this one   Gonna make that Boongie drop      Pop, lock and drop it   I make that pussy speak Patois   Like Petra, remember hah?.Have you heard what they say, did you read the news?.Lay your problems on the floor, clap your hands and sing once more:   Everybody, let's go to the ""King"",      It's time to dance, it's time to sing, sing a happy song, a happy song..Say no more,   If you want to kiss goodnight,   That's alright by me..Ha ha   Or funny queer shit?.'Twant for powder an' for store-bought hair,   De man ah love would not gone nowhere, nowhere..You gotta know the feel   You gotta know the life   You know what I'm sayin' (Hey!).I don't really know how to say this...

"Should offensive material be removed from the library? I think no, and there are many reasons as to why I disagree with this idea. Many books, movies, and magazines are not ment to offend people, but just to let the reader know how the author feels. I think that the books, movies, magazines, etc. should stay on the shelf because if they are removed what are we left with? Seems like all that would remain would be the dictonary. I think that when Katherine Paterson said, 'Children or any other children have taken off the shelf' that she was making a big mistake.      So what seems to be offensive to people? Topics such as gosip and politics are a gold mine for authors in the @DATE1. Yet people find these topics to be offense probably due to that persons backround. If aomeone find a read to be offensive, then they should stop reading and that be it. Instead, people deside to go on a rampage against that magazine or whatever they read and what it banned for life from others to read. Readers have the choice to read whatever they want and if they disagree with that subject, just move on with their lifes.      At the library I attend many poeple different shapes and sizes walk through the door everyday. Many of them like a different subject then the others, so its commen to find everybody reading about a different topic. Sure someone here and there does not gree with an author, but never decide to go crazy about it. Instead they just go pick a different read to enjoy for themselves. People read what they want to so they can enjoy it, not to bash the wuthor for his writing.          In my own read's, I have found at times stuff i disagree with. Instead of going off the deep end and getting all excited about it, I choose to think about where the author is coming from and try to understand his side. On the other hand, some movies are ment to be for one type of audience when instead another audience see's the material. This still should not get movies or whatever the material is banned from the library. When on the box it says rated for teenagers and up, that means it is not for a four year old to watch and their parents get mad at them for it. If people followed what the box says and listen to the guidlines, then there would be no problem.     I disagree with @PERSON2 when she said that some books, magazines, movies, etc. should be removed from the library. People have the right to read anything and to see anything they want, and if they disagree well they should just deal with it. In my own exprience, I have not found there to be a problem in my community library with people wanting content removed. Once people start following guidlines and reading the boxes and still disagree, then maybe will have something then. But until then, we should keep our nations libraries the way they are today.O brothers let's go down,   Let's go down, come on down,   Come on brothers let's go down,   Down in the river to pray..This year   To save me from tears   I'll give it to someone special..I said a-hey there baby, do you want to make the scene?.Stars are moving like the night we met,   The earth is turning like the time we said..We share each other   While the suns going down,   Not another soul around,   Alone at last,   You and I.

standing so near to me..My Father's Song   Words and music by Ray Boltz   When I was just a little child   We'd climb in this old family car   And daddy would start to sing   Before we rode very far   I really don't remember   If his songs were quite on key   But that didn't matter to me   It was my Father's song   CHORUS:   And he sings a song of love   And a song of caring   You sing it with your heart   You sing it with your life   And it's a song of giving   Much more than you're asked   And knowing that   What you've done for Christ   Is all that's going to last   As I grew up I heard that song   Time and time again   A gentle word or a tender touch   And that song would begin   I can hear it in his laughter   And it moves me more and more   I can see it in his eyes   When he talks about the Lord   It's my Father's song   And if I were the greatest musician   Who ever walked upon a stage   If I could sing any song I liked   Any instrument I could play   I wouldn't need a piano   I wouldn't need a violin   I'd choose a heart filled with his love   And then I'd begin   To sing my Father's song   His song   CHORUS   1991 Shepherd Boy MusicASCAP (exclusively administered by

"Have you ever imagined a @CAPS1 without movies or music to entertain you? A @CAPS1 that has no books to read or magazines to inform you upon the latest gossip and fashion? Well, if items are banned from being seen or read then there will be no creativity in the @CAPS1, there will soon be no books or magazines to read, no music to listen too, and no movies to watch, and you will not be able to express yourself or your opinions. I do not believe that certain materials should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive.     If the @CAPS1 is left without certain materials there will be no creativity. Everyone will be forced to think the same thoughts if they can't learn about other thoughts that are protrayed to be offensive. No one can read about a topic that they are interested in if it is banned, this will cease creative thinking by not allowing people to think differently.     In the process of deciding what books are offensive and which are not offensive, all books will eventually be eliminated. Certain topics aren't liked by everyone and, as Katherine Paterson says, '...if I have the right to remove that book... so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' Paterson is exactly right too; if one person has the right to remove a book, so does everyone and this will cause everyone to take off that book that they dislike so much. Also, everyone likes different kinds of books and different topics, and this will cause less self expression because if someone doesn't like books about @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 because they think it is offensive to @CAPS4, then there will be no books about @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 on the shelves for anyone to learn about it.     Everyone will turn out to be the same if they can't express themselves or their opinions. If a certain topic is banned for being discovered as a offensive topic then this will result in the thought being banned. If you can't read or watch a topic you shouldn't be able to think or talk of the topic either because you will offend someone. Also, if people can pick what books can be in a library, that will eventually be transferred over into other areas, such as clothing, food, thoughts, etc.. Eventually everyone will be wearing the same clothes, eating the same food, and thinking the same thoughts.     I do not believe that certain materials should be exterminated from the shelves if they are found offensive. If specific materials are banned: creativity will be eliminated from our lives, eventually all materials will be banned, and we will all be the same by the lack of self expression. If you haven't ever thought about a @CAPS1 without books, moves, music or magazines; I hope you have learned how crule and boring the @CAPS1 would be without all of those materials..Now that I know   Not really diggin' this!.I'm nothing special   In fact, I'm a bit of a bore   If I tell a joke   You probably heard it before      But I have a talent   A wonderful thing   'cause everyone listens   When I start to sing   I'm so grateful and proud   All I want is to sing it loud      [Chorus]   So, I say, thank you for the music   The songs I'm singing   Thanks for all the joy they're bringing   Who can live without it, I ask in all honesty   What would life be without a song or dance   What are we   So, I say, thank you for the music   For giving it to me      Mother says I was a dancer before I could walk   Um, she says I began to sing long before I could talk   But, I often wonder how did it all start   To find that there's nothin' can capture a heart   Like a memory can   Well, whoever it was, I'm a fan      [Chorus]      I've been so lucky, I am the girl with golden hair   I want to sing it out to everybody   What a joy, what a life, what a chance      Thank you for the music   The songs I'm singing   Thanks for all the joy they're bringing   Who could live without it, I ask in all honesty   What would life be without a song or dance   What are we   So, I say, thank you for the music   For giving it to me      So, I say, thank you for the music   For giving it to me.If you go, if you go, you know you're gonna grieve me   'Cause all my life on you depends      I'm guessing that you love me, yeah   Dreaming, dreaming, dreaming, dreaming, dreaming, dreaming dreams of you in vain   Oh, I'm confessin' that I love you   Over and over and over and over and over and over again   I'm confessin' that I love you over and over and over   All over again, oh yeah.This is for my people's who lost their   Grandmothers   Lift your head up to the sky   'Cause we will never say bye..Yellow clover entangled blossoms   In a meadow silky green   Where she held me to her bosom   Just a boy of seventeen..As a child, there were them times   I didn't get it, but you kept me inline   I didn't know   Why you didn't show up sometimes   On Sunday mornings   And I missed you, but what we talked through   All them grown folk things, separation brings   You never let me know it, you never let it show   Because you loved me   And so much more then to say   If you were with me today   Face to face..I have been here many times before   In a life I used to live   But I have never seen these streets so fresh   Washed with morning rain      I have seen this face a thousand times   Every morning of my life   But I never saw these eyes so clear   Free of doubt and pain      Like the whole world has been made again      I have been here many times before   In a life I used to live      And it's all because you made me see   What is false and what is true   Like the inside and the outside of me   Is being made again by you      And it's all because you made me see   What is false and what is true   Like the inside and the outside of me   Has been made again by you      Like a bright new morning   Like a bright new day   I woke up from a deep sleep   I woke up from a bad dream      To a brand new morning   To a brand new day   Like the whole world has been made again.I bear more grudges   Than lonely high court judges   When you sleep   I will creep   Into your thoughts   Like a bad debt   That you can't pay   Take the easy way   And give in   Yeah, and let me in   Oh, let me in   Oh let me   Oh, let me in   It's war   It's war   It's war   It's war   It's war   War   War   War   War   Oh, let me in   Ah, the closer I get   Ah, you're asking for it   Ah, the closer I get   Ooh, the closer I.A misstep -

"First of all, Do you believe that certain materials, such as books, music, magazined, etc, should be remove from the shelves if they are found offensive, thats question should not be ask ever in life.      Why beacuse there are many people out there that read read stuff and listen to stuff that you might not like at all. when i first saw this question i answer to my self that, ''That if all people think the same way this world would be boring, and i answer the question by saying that there should not be any books remove or music remove, from any shelves' why beacause we all don tlike the same thing or do the same thing.     In first place, I know that there are many different kind of thing that people beacause they love doing it and some dont do those kind of things beacause they really dont like or dont care about it. This is answering the question about removing books, music, or magazines from shelves even if the article the book, music, etc, say's or if its offensive to other people, that is not a reason to remove stuff. There are thing that you enjoy doing and things that you emjoy reading, listening, and looking, etc that other people dont like or hate about it.     In second place, not only beacause you dont like something people should stop doing those things or stop buying those thing, NO!!, that is not the case here @CAPS1. or @CAPS2. you should not care just for you or do what ever is right for you. If you are a good person that wants to be someone in the future dont just care about you care about the other too, beacause you'll need those person or those book in the future when ever your falling down.     In my conclusion, about this article. I think that people should not remove any thing from any library even if its found offensive to other people, those thing help other in life to do what they really want to do, while other are getting hurt for those offensive this that are writting on a little peace of paper. Hope this latter help you all think about and change your decision about this case, hope you all make the right decision that would not affect anyone in general.     Thank you for taking your time to ready what I really think about removing articles from libraries.Excited at prospects,   Humbled and mad   Needy as a baby....Something's come, feel it down in my bones   Yeah it's been a long time gone, but ya here tonight   Now let's not look back, ya keeping me right on track   Feel the karma coming back, we're gonna be alright      If everything's a constant battle, sometimes you won't win   If all our strengths turn into struggles we won't be giving in      We'll be living on an all time high   I'm trying to keep it   We've learnt to walk but now it's time to run   A change is gonna come   Living on an all time high   I'm gonna live it   First thought we couldn't but it can be done   Change is gonna come      Troubled times, been a good friend of mine   Yeah it's been around a while keeping me down   But through it all, even with a broken soul   Here I am standing tall cause you're around      If everything's a constant battle, sometimes you won't win   If all our strengths turn into struggles we won't be giving in      We'll be living on an all time high   I'm trying to keep it   We've learnt to walk but now it's time to run   A change is gonna come   Living on an all time high      I'm gonna live it   First thought we couldn't but it can be done   Change is gonna come      For every sign that said we'd never find the means to   For every word they said they never heard that they knew   Given time I want some piece of mind   Same as you do   Sing it!.Momma's all worried when you get home late   And droppin' the ring in the spaghetti plate   'Cause you're hands are shakin' so much   And its the way that she looks with her eyes and her hair..And I would ask the woman, ""Can you find it in yourself to please stand back?.(Kick it up a notch, kick it up a notch) Not gonna go with the flow..Got to be a winner, trophy winner   Get to hold your head up high up!.Where she gone, where she gone, I just don't know..They can play a bu-gle call like you nev-er heard be-fore   So nat-you-ral that you want to go to war   That's just the best-est band what am, oh, ma hon-ey lamb   Come on a-long, come on a-long, let me take you by the hand   Up to the man, up to the man, who's the lead-er of the band   And if you care to hear the Swa-nee Riv-er played in rag-time   Come on and hear, come on and hear,   Al-ex-an-der's Rag-Time Band.Gonna leave the city put my troubles behind   People in the city goin' out of their minds   Goin' to the country just to feel like gold   People in the country really let themselves go      Hey, ho, one thing I know   People in the country got one thing for sure   Hey, ho, one thing I know   Every mother's child really lets himself go      Goin' to the country and leavin' right away   No time to talk I got to make a getaway   Gonna leave the city it's a crime and a shame   People in the city are goin' insane      Hey, ho, one thing I know   Every mother's child really lets himself go   Hey, ho, one thing I know   People in the country really let themselves go      Joining hands   Making plans   Come on down   Look around.Have you seen me lately?.Now you're stranded alone   And the past is unknown   And there is no easy way down..Yeah..You're a black hole!.Can't it wait until tomorrow?.The village lads and lassies say   With roses they will strew the way,   And we'll all feel gay when Johnny comes marching home..No Blacks..There's a thousand pretty women just a-waiting out there,   And they're all livin' devil-may-care..Am I still your sweet pearl?.Well, I'm beggin' you say it's not the end   I don't know what I've done,   But I won't do it again   I still remember all the good times we had   Good time that went to make a romance   So it hurts to be told   I'm out in the cold   And to me it don't seem right..Do you wanna see the girl who lives behind the aura?.Is it any wonder   I'm cryin' in the sun?.Home ever home,   How could I ever doubt you   Love, precious love, how could I live without you?"
"Libraries should not remove a book from the shelves just because someone didn't like it or finds it offensive. If there is a group of people that are interested in a book and want to read it more then once they will like telling a new person about it. Then if another student has decided they don't like the book and they don't want anyone else reading it becuase they find it offensive then I honestly believe it shouldn't be taking off the shelves.      I think it would be different if everyone found the book offensive, but if it's just one or two people complaining then I don't think they should take it down and ruin it for everybody else. It's just a book and students should know just because it's there doesn't mean its directed towards them. I think they should overlook it.     If your playing some music, dacing around, and just having fun with it then thats good. Now, if there is cussing and talking about drugs and those sort of things in a song then don't play it in a school system or around someone that @MONTH1 be religious or against that kind of thing because they @MONTH1 not like it and think that your into that sort of things. They might not want to be around you as much. Show them respect and play something everyone can have fun with. So if the libary has this type of music it should be monitored as to who checks it out.     Movies are something you have to look out for too. Movies already have ratings so this kind of helps for people to check them out and make sure the movie would be safe to watch. If your getting movies from the libary then I would think it would already been watched by an adult there to make sure it can be watched by a student or a child. I wouldnt want my little sibblings watching something that they didn't need to see or hear.     You have to watch out for magazines too. You want a magazine that is going to be interesting and clean. Kids @MONTH1 not know what is bad from good, but you still have teenagers. You don't want kids seeing nudity, cussing, or drugs in any magazine. If I were to walk in a library and see those kind of things in a magazine I would suggest you to take it off the shelves. I would only suggest that so the kids will have a healthy thought about things. I wouldn't want them thinking about doing anything bad like they saw in the magazine. I'm just looking out for their safety.     Libraries @MONTH1 always need advice. They need to always have an eye out for things and make sure everything is clean and so that everyone can look at it, read it, or watch it. I'm glad we have these safety ideas for kids. I hope everyone has an eye out for these kind of things. I know I if I were to ever have children I would want them around something they understand and know, nothing bad and harmful. So thanks to libraries that have an eye out for things like this.The stars are brightly shining   It is the night of our dear Savior's birth   Long lay the world   In sin and error pining   Till He

There was magic in the air      Clouds surrounded the summit   The wind blew strong and cold   Among the silent temples   And the writing carved in gold   Somewhere in my instincts   The primitive took hold      I stood at the top of the mountain   And China sang to me   In the peaceful haze of harvest time   A song of eternity      If you raise your hands to heaven   You will live a hundred years   I stood there like a mystic   Lost in the atmosphere      The clouds were suddenly parted   For a moment I could see   The patterns of the landscape   Reaching to the eastern sea   I looked upon a presence   Spanning forty centuries      I thought of time and distance   The hardships of history   I heard the hope and the hunger   When China sang to me.Take my heart and my soul!.Let's Go!.You know you're nice, you're sugar and spice   And I know what you're going through   And if you're hot HOT, and even if you're not   Baby let your favorite daddy see you through      Oh baby

"In the world, there are just some things that our children should not be exposed to. I believe that the media such as music, magazines, and movies set a high bar for the individuals in our society. I highly disagree with what the media feeds to our minds as to the way our looks and lifestyle should be.     The library is a place where most children go to feed their imaginations with colorful books with morals; but the library is also where adults go to free their minds of work and to escape many of life's responsibilities. Most children from ages @NUM1 to @NUM2 draw a curious mind to the very adult world and seek to find answers. Now the library is not a place where a child can recieve adult information right? Wrong! the library shelves are open to any and everyones advantage. A child can just as easily come across the wrong track to take ones innocence. Some parents in sociey believe that their neighborhood is a perfect harm free enviornment to raise children. Little do parents know, it is a very uncensored world and at anytime a child can learn of it's exsistance.     The media draws it's attention to captivate our children. We have to watch what we let our kids watch, listen to, and read. For example, the girl in the magazine who just recently got a nose job because her nose was too big is feeding the idea to your eight year old daughter. She believes that she can recieve surgery to fix her big nose that the kids at school tease her about. Maybe your son listens to rap or rock music that condones the use of violence, drug, and alcohol use. He will think its ok to pick fights at school with other children or curse the teacher. Or the movie with the sex scene in it could give your child the idea to go out and practice what was taught.     In our society, there should not be an image that our children should try and sustain. We should teach our children that life is better explored through @PERSON1's '@ORGANIZATION1' or through the wonderful adventures of 'The @CAPS1 of @ORGANIZATION2'. Parents should feed kids 'imagination' and not feed their 'image'. Life for our children should be about fun, knowledge, and life experience; but not everything that is on the shelves of our local library..I'm climbin' this ladder,   My head in the clouds   I hope that it matters,   I'm havin' my doubts..Let it snow!.I am the stallion.This is more than just a game..Hey you!.Have you ever been   Have you ever been   To Electric Ladyland?.We could share a love   We could share a love...

nowhere to hide   It's them kids from the other side Shaolin worldwide   I.N.S., Homicide, nowhere to run to      [Chorus]      I'm the four mic emcee with five mic potential   Overlooked cuz y'all

says   Will I be saved   From these Titanic days      A violent frenzy   In a none too cheap hotel   He says it's hazy   But I remember it so well   His arms, his face   The way my words got twisted out of place      Dream on he says   Dream on he always says   It's sink or swim   In these Titanic days      So hot so hungry   So faretheewell goodbye   I got so angry   Now I sit here and sigh   My love, always   We should rejoice in these Titanic days      Dream on he says   Dream on he says   Will I be saved   Will I be saved   Dream on he says   Dream on he says   Do you ever get that sinking feeling?.And you see me fly away without you..When she starts movin' you sure can tell When she starts shakin' she's raisin' hell..You take the dishes, the silverware   Well, I'll keep the hound dog and this easy chair   Keep the Ranchero but that TV is mine   She said, ""You can stick that clicker where the sun don't shine""      I know you're leaving   I can't change your mind   It's been nice to know you   Could you leave that sweet thing behind?.[Chorus]      People of the world we must change our mind frame   And stay away from the con and mind games..(no, it ain't good at all, you know)   Spoken:   Listen, have you been treating your lady nice lately, you have?.She left me almost burned out   I couldn't feel a thing   A walkin' talkin' statue   Afraid to love again   She did everything to kill a flame   But a little spark got through   She'd of got her way   I'd be gone today   If it hadn't been for you      You turn cold gray ashes into   Hot burning flames   I'm alive with love because of you   When you came to light the fire   I knew just what to bring   You turn cold gray ashes into   Hot burning flames      She thought she had me down and out   But at the count of nine   A livin' lovin' angel   Showed up just in time   She thought that I would surely die   Sometimes I wanted to   She had no doubt   The fire was out   But she didn't count on you      You turn cold gray ashes into   Hot burning flames   I'm alive with love because of you   When you came to light the fire   I knew just what to bring   You turn cold gray ashes into   Hot burning flames      You turn cold gray ashes into   Hot burning flames   I'm alive with love because of you   When you came to light the fire   I knew just what to bring   You turn cold gray ashes into   Hot burning flames      You turn cold gray ashes into   Hot burning flames.Cindy, oh Cindy   Cindy don't let me down   Write me a letter soon   And I'll be homeward bound      I joined the Navy to see the world

with mosquitoes, they heard that my body was free   Then I took the dust of a long sleepless night and I put it in your little shoe   And then I confess that I tortured the dress that you wore for the world to look through      I showed my heart to the doctor..And who gave you the right to shake my baby, she needs me   And who gave you the right to shake my family tree?.I saw you just the other

"Offensive literature, sexual content, disagreeable topics. Books all have those things to someone some where. It would be impossible to get rid of all of the books that offended everyone and still have books left. There are many reasons why censorship is pointless and wrong. Censorship only causes curiosity. Censoring books could take away from learning. The real world is not censored so books should not be either.     Consorship only causes curiosity. Young kids every day are told what to do and what not to do. Many people know that children are most likely to want to do exactly the opposite of what they are told to do. Being censored from things makes people want to rebel and learn the truth. No one likes to be told what they can and can not do. The same goes for being told what you can and can not read. No one wants the truth cut out of  their reading materials.      Censoring books could take away from learning. In school children are required to read many different books in their english classes. Some books, depending on the teacher, have what some would consider offensive language and topics. What some people do not understand is that reading those things are a part of life. Reading foul language would not be any more offensive than if someone was to use the same foul language in front of you in real life. In fact, the real life situation would seem to be more offensive. If we are censored from these things how will we learn that they exist.     The real world is not censored so books should not be either. You can not go walking down the street and expect a loud beep to randomly play over someone's foul banter everytime they curse. When someone says something offensive in the real world you have to learn to deal with it appropriately and maturely. We can not cut out peoples offensive banter in real life so why should we do it in our reading material. Has no one ever heard of freedom of speech? That ammendment was created for a reason, to let @CAPS1 speek their beliefs.     Everywhere we look today things are being censored and 'cleaned up' to make others happy who @MONTH1 be offended by whatever it is they are censoring. Sometimes it is appropriate for offensive language or topics to be written about. People need to be able to speek their minds and beliefs. But people also need to be able to have constructive critisism and be mature about offensive writing. Everyone will be offended in one way or another some time in their life by something they will read or already have read. It is just life.Yes..Day after day I'm more confused   Still I look for the sun through the pouring rain   You know that's a game that I hate to lose   And I'm feeling the strain   Aint it a shame      Give me the beat boys and free my soul   I want to get lost in your rock and roll and drift away   Give me the beat boys and free my soul   I want to get lost in your rock and roll and drift away      Beginning to think that I'm wasting time   I don't understand the things I do   World outside looks so unkind   And I'm counting on you to carry me through      Oh give me the beat boys and free my soul   I want to get lost in your rock and roll and drift away   I said give me the beat boys and free my soul   I want to get lost in your rock and roll and drift away      When my mind is free   You know that a melody can move me   And when I'm feeling blue   The guitars coming through to soothe me      Thanks for the joy that youve given me   I want you to know I believe in your song   Rhythm and rhyme and harmony   Youve helped me along making me strong      Oh give me the beat boys and free my soul   I want to get lost in your rock and roll and drift away   I said give me the beat boys and free my soul   I want to get lost in your rock and roll and drift away      Give me the beat boys and free my soul   I want to get lost in your rock and roll and drift away all right   I said give me the beat boys and free my soul   (oh now it's time to come on and free my soul)   I want to get lost in your rock and roll and drift away   (were gonna drift away)   Why don't you give me the beat boys and free my soul   (take me, take me, take me away)   I want to get lost in your rock and roll and drift away   (oh)   I said give me the beat boys and free my soul   I want to get lost in your rock and roll and drift away.Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh   Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh   Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh   Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh      Yesterday may linger forever   Today may never be found   Tomorrow may never come   Tomorrow may never come      Yesterday may haunt us forever   Today may pass in fear   Tomorrow my never come   Tomorrow may never come      All we have is you and I   (All we have, you and I)   Feeling the wind and the sky   (Feel the wind, the sky)   Reach me, touch me, hold me   (Hold me)   Hold me while my lips are still soft      Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh   Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh   Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh   Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh      Yesterday may scar us forever   Today may never be found   Tomorrow may never come   (Never, never, never come)   Tomorrow may never come      All we have is you and I   (All we have, you and I)   Feeling the wind and the sky   (Feel the wind, the sky)   Reach me, touch me, hold me   (Hold me)   Hold me while my lips are still soft      Reach me   (Reach me)   Touch me   (Touch me)   Reach me   (Reach me)   Touch me      Hold me, hold me, hold me   (Hold me)   Hold me while my lips are still warm      Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh   Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh   Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh   Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh.And you tell me that I'm beautiful but that could be lie   Are you a heartbreaker   Maybe you want me for the ride   What if I'm fallin' for a heartbreaker and everything is just a lie   I wont be leavin' here alive   I wont be leavin' here alive, no   Temporary happiness is like waiting for the knife   Cause I'm always watchin' for someone to show their darker side   So maybe I'll sit back and just enjoy all this for now   Watch it all play out see if you really stick around   But there's always this one question that keeps me up at night   Are you my greatest love or disappointment in my life   Are you a heartbreaker maybe you want me for the ride what if I'm fallin' for a heartbreaker and everything is just a lie   I wont be leaving here alive   I might as well lay down and die   I'm holding on with both hands and both feet ooohhhh   Promise that you won't pull the rug out from under me   Are you a heartbreaker maybe you want me for the ride   I pray to god you're not a heartbreaker   This time around I wont survive cause if I've fallin' for a heartbreaker   And everything is just a lie   I wont be leaving here alive   I might as well lay down and die   I wont be leaving here alive.If you don't want to get nervous   Do yourself a great big service   Stay away please far from seventh avenue   You can lose your sense and reason   Guessing what style for next season   Yes, the dress business will make a wreck of you   It's a battle of fierce and grim   That depends on the ladies' whim   What'll miss and misses america's answer be   Will she say with a tossing head   And that rare guy wouldn't drop dead   Or she'll say : yes, this dress is really me   On guessing what, a day will say   A sheer impossibility   This poor kid's brave, he worked away   And try to build that industry   How crazy, bold and reckless   Can human beings be...

"I do not believe that certain materials such as books, music,            magazines, ect should be removed from the shelves.              Libraries or any place else. I believe that if someone wanted to          know more information about something the library or the @CAPS2 should be able to provide it for them. Imagine if the           Libraries and the @CAPS1 started putting these materials away, many people wouldnt bother to go to either. The @CAPS2 in my      eyes is a place that shows me where we have been, what we have been threw, and things we have accomplished while we           have been there.In the @CAPS1 could you imagine walking around touring seeing nothing about you past?,'No, I couldn't.          Eventhough things @MONTH1 seem offensive in ones eyes, it could be the history of anothers. Many people now days relie on the           useage of the magazines, books,and music to get information from. I believe that everyone has a right to know what has                happened in their pass to have gotten to their future, so taking away information that @MONTH1 seem offensive to someone           else isn't fair. I believe that we should keep all information in lilbraries, @CAPS1, art shows because everything has it's on history behind it, and if we just cover it up we will never know.

"Offensive @CAPS1 @CAPS2     @CAPS3 entering a @CAPS1 you know your are going to find something interesting to read,listen to, or even watch. Most people use librarys to find information on a certain topic, some of these topics are not always appropiate for certain age groups. I do believe that materials on any subject should reflect how people see the world now. Most kids go to the @CAPS1 and look to find books that interest them, sometimes they cross book about stuff they should'nt know about yet. Libraries should be allowed to have anything on there shelf that they please but allow it to certain age groups.     @CAPS3 you were a little kid and you wanted to look up information on racing, you might have passes by many books about racism. As a little kid you might not know what that is but all you have to do is pick up and read. That kid just went from reading abot nascar to reading about racism and different races. I believe that book should be kept in order of age. @CAPS3 a teenager goes into the @CAPS1 to look up a book, they should be able to go to a section for teens and get a book on there topic. In most libraires there are topics such as sex, killing , and viloent matters. Kids should not be allowed to view that detail until they are ready for it.     If I am at the @CAPS1 I will always look for a book interest me. My skills on choosing books for myself has changed since i was @NUM1 or @NUM2. Now that older and like to read, I read more books about action and mystery. I was at the our hometown @CAPS1 and saw a @NUM3 year old kid looking at books about pregnancy and was shocked to see what he was reading after he put the book down. That same day I came across a younger kid approaching his father with a book about sex and one about killing. @CAPS3 I saw this I was suprised to see what was happening. I do believe that libraries should be able to showcase what they have but in certain age sections..     Kids visit the @CAPS1 all the time and looking for books to strike interest and will always find something different that they should not be exposed too. Libraires would have trouble containg what kids read, so they should exposed all the differnt topics. @CAPS3 your little and your reading about these topics, you will then be more informed @CAPS3 your just little older.     Next time @CAPS3 you visit the @CAPS1 check and see what kids in your local towe are talking and reading about. You will be suprised @CAPS3 a child apporachs his parents with a book about sex. I think that all libraies should exposed what they want @CAPS3 they want to ensure knowledge to everyone..Oh I want baby doll that can cry, drink, scream oh yeah   And then away went Rudolph   Whizzin' like a saber jet, yeah      Run run Rudolph   Run run Rudolph   Runnin' like a son of gun   Run run Rudolph   Run run Rudolph   Running like a son of gun   Run, run, oh run, yeah.When you're awake and in your head?.The yellow raven sipped the air   Of thunder and of rain   The yellow raven sipped the air   Gentle eyes kissing the rain      Where do you go, fantastic dream bird?.Won't, won't you tell me what, what's going on?.And I don't care, what people say   And I don't care, what people think   And I don't care, how we look   Walking down the street      They make me feel so--   I love, little girls      They don't care if I'm a one-way mirror   They don't care about my cold exterior      They don't (they don't), ask me questions (ask me questions)   They don't (they don't), want to scold me (want to scold me)   They don't (they don't), look for answers (look for answers)   They just (they just), want to hold me (want to hold me)      Uh oh (uh oh), I'm in trouble (I'm in trouble)   Uh oh (uh oh), the little girls was just too little   Too little, too little, too little, too little   Too little, too little, too little, too little      Isn't this what life's all about?.Oh, kiss me beneath the milky twilight,   Lead me out on the moonlit floor..That's it..The Maker said take her and treat her right, just treat her right..Holy, holy, holy,   Holy, holy, holy,   Holy is the lord, god almighty..Look here brother, don't waste your time on me   (don't waste your time)      I've got troubles of my own, I said   And you can't help me out   So, take your meditations and your preparations   And ram it up your snout!.Nobody, who is like the Lord?.Giddy and foolish the whole day through   Boom, boom, ain't it great to be crazy?.I learn in ev'ry single day,   Inside out, outside in, ev'ry way..I wonder, I wonder.Is that something so funny?.Come down - your tea is on the table   Nothing seems to matter anymore   And if you're good well go out on sunday   Spend the whole day thinking of you   Take you sailing across the water   To a faraway place   Remember when life was lovely   Forever was captured in your smile   When we were young and life was hopeful   No one threatend our existence   We were laughing   They couldn't stop us   No one in the world      Remember when life was lovely   Forever was captured in your smile   When we were young and life was hopeful   No one threatend our existence   We were laughing   They couldn't stop us   No one in the world.Some can sing   Songs of Gods,   Words so beautiful   They fall like raindrops..I take a little powder, take a little salt, put it in my shotgun, I go walkin'   Jubba jubba, wolly bully, looking high, looking low,   Gonna scare you up and shoot ya, Mister Charlie told me so..Well, turn on the end and baby turn off the lamps   There'll be an end darling to this endless night   On the other side of the street..We ain't over   Oh it's gonna be alright now don't go now.What if I came knocking   On your bedpost that same night?.Baby's getting anxious, the hour's getting late   The night is almost over, she can't wait      Oh, things are complicating, my love is in her hands   And there's no more waiting, she understands      The plaster's gettin' harder and my love is perfection   A token of my love for her collection, her collection      Plaster caster, grab a hold of me faster   And if you wanna see my love, just ask her   And my love is the plaster   And yeah, she's the collector   She wants me all the time to inject her      The plaster's gettin' harder and my love is perfection   A token of my love for her collection      Plaster caster, plaster caster   Grab a hold of me faster, plaster, faster   And if you wanna see my love, just ask her, ask her   Go on, ask her      The plaster's gettin' harder and my love is perfection   A token of my love for her collection, her collection      Plaster caster, plaster caster   Grab a hold of me faster, plaster, faster   If you wanna see my love, just ask her, ask her      Plaster caster, plaster caster   She wants my love to last her, last her, last her   And she calls me by the name of master, master      Plaster caster, plaster caster   Grab a hold of me faster, plaster, faster   If you wanna see my love, just ask her, ask her      Plaster caster, plaster caster   Grab a hold of me faster, plaster, faster   And if you wanna see my love, just ask her, ask her   Plaster caster, plaster caster"
"I don't think nothing should be taking off the shelves at the libraries, if it's educational to your child in a certain way it should stay. Children can learn alot from the books at the libraries. If you need help or answers about certain things you can always find what you are looking for in a library, they have all the answers. You can not get everything off the internet some stuff you have to look up by opening a book. As I was growing up, I was able to get what I needed done for my school at the library.     It's so many things at the libraries that's educational, you just have to know what you are looking for. For some of these adults, if you was having a hard time looking for what you needed at the library, do not mean the same for your child. Sometimes your children has a better time understanding then you did at their age. Parents please don't take away the good things out the libraries that could really help your child at times. If it was not helpful, they would have never put it in the library from the start.     There are things that you would be better off finding in a book, because not everthing is on the enternet. So many sciencest found their information in a book, because its easier. You learn so many good things from a libraries. The books and things in a library help you with so much research. Taking materials out of a library I would have to disagree..These demons in my head tell me to      I'm lying here in bed   Swear my skin is inside out   Just another Sunday morning      Seen my diary on the newsstand   Seems we've lost the truth to quicksand   It's a shame no one is praying   'Cause these voices in my head   Keep saying      'Love, just don't stare.'.I wanna drink from your naked fountain   i can drown your sorrows   I'm gonna burn Burn you to life now   Out of the chains that bind you      Can you see just like a child?.I went down to the place   Where I knew she lay waiting   Under the marble and the snow   I said, Mother I'm frightened   The thunder and the lightning   I'll never come through this alone   She said, I'll be with you   My shawl wrapped around you   My hand on your head when you go   And the night came on   It was very calm      I wanted the night to go on and on   But she said, Go back to the World   We were fighting in Egypt   When they signed this agreement   That nobody else had to die   There was this terrible sound   And my father went down   With a terrible wound in his side   He said, Try to go on   Take my books, take my gun   Remember, my son, how they lied   And the night comes on   It's very calm   I'd like to pretend that my father was wrong   But you don't want to lie, not to the young      We were locked in this kitchen   I took to religion   And I wondered how long she would stay   I needed so much   To have nothing to touch   I've always been greedy that way   But my son and my daughter   Climbed out of the water   Crying, Papa, you promised to play   And they lead me away   To the great surprise   It's Papa, don't peek, Papa, cover your eyes   And they hide, they hide in the World      Now I look for her always   I'm lost in this calling   I'm tied to the threads of some prayer   Saying, When will she summon me   When will she come to me   What must I do to prepare   When she bends to my longing   Like a willow, like a fountain   She stands in the luminous air   And the night comes on   And it's very calm   I lie in her arms and says, When I'm gone   I'll be yours, yours for a song      Now the crickets are singing   The vesper bells ringing   The cat's curled asleep in his chair   I'll go down to Bill's Bar   I can make it that far   And I'll see if my friends are still there   Yes, and here's to the few   Who forgive what you do   And the fewer who don't even care   And the night comes on   It's very calm   I want to cross over, I want to go home   But she says, Go back, go back to the World.OutKast this Dirty South to death the Dungeon Family Camp   Got this thang lit like stamps and nine-volt battery end caps   Making that music that make your neck hurt   And the beats that bother your back in my Cadillac   Six woofers and four amps, lo pro vogues on swole   With the carriage lamps diamond tucked velour pistol in my lap   Come in peace but then xplode like booty traps.Yeah-yeah-yeah   Yeah-yeah-yeah   Yeah-yeah!.As long as he needs me...

"Sometimes i think its always good to have an anappropiate material on the shelves of stores or a library. i feel this way because of when you see stuff that is offensive, most people are willing to buy. Or maybe when you been through rough times in your life, people like to read books that can be offensive be cause it was a reflection of the way they've been brought up.         My views on censorhip contain to keep the offensive materials because its what people like best. Music, magazines, books, and movies. All of these materials can entertain adults, and teenagers because of the anappropiate sayings. It seems to give people to boost up their style and ways to act, such as music as the number one offensive material. Music comes from everywhere around the world, where young teens adapt to that kind of music and starts to feel that anapprpiate vibe.          Another reason my views on censorship contain to keep the offensive materials is because of what we see and watch. Movies and television. when we watch a movie thats is offensive and that can be very anappropiate, you learn from whats in the movie. Most people make movies that can teach lessons if your willing to follow behind, or some movies contain advice for people that are going for the wrong things in life. Thats one of my main reasons i think the newspaper should keep offensive movies in stores. Television is basically the same for movies. You can learn a lot from a offensive @CAPS1 show, you can learn what and what not to do.          Also my views on censorship contain to keep the offensive materials of what we read, books; books are entertainment and what most of us like to do when we have free time off our hands. People seem to read books because of the catorgories that most likely are to fit the way they are, such as reflections of peoples lifes, rough, lovely, funny and drama. We attend to read these offensive books because of what some of us been through as a kid or just would like to read it because they wanna maybe feel the same sympothy that some one else @MONTH1 have had. Also books can be adviceful of ehat people want to do in life, careers that you @MONTH1 be intersted in.     last but not least on my views on censorship contain to keep the offensive materials like magazines. Magazines are the least offensive object that is placed on a shelf. I go against the reason of magazines to be on the shelf because its alot of gossip. I believe gossip is one of the main reasons why most people buy magazines. Also because of the false information. The false information that that give, is what we wanna buy. But for the most part of my oppinion, i believe that this material should not be in the store unless they change it up.     I believe the offensive materials music, movies, books, and some what of magazines should be on the shelves of stores because lots of people are willing to buy. They all catch eyes for gossip, provokinding adds.Felicidad.Back this way   Follow me now, head this way   Into this, while I rap on through this   For many germs, who never knew this      Switches, upside down   Turn around, look in the mirror   You rap catchers are makin' a error   Every inning, I'm back to the dugout      You on the field, I'm ready to bugout   Like a manager, smackin' up your team   Male or female, ducks who dream   Of takin' me, on the mic and makin' me   Rack up, MC's I stack up      Foreign precinct rappers need to back up   Quickly, I'm a rip your brain off   Throw it down so the blood can drain off   My hands, while I wave to a fan      I'm Kool Keith, not a Bill or a Dan   But a General, equal to a mineral   Pushin' a crowd, to keep on dancin'   I'm Housing Things      Now I'm back, to continue my verses   I'm never screamin' loud with any curses   Rougly, that a child can learn   I teach kids and ducks that burn      With a flamethrower, and how do you show a...

learn..Why?.Devious to those unknown   He walks below the land   Alluring victims to their death   Perish to the sand      Master of the blackened arts   Living his decree   Thrives amongst the Seven Gates   Searching for the keys      [Chorus]   I have seen the darkened depths of Hell   Sorcery beyond the witches' spell   Robbed the crypts of Death's eternity   Killed the priest and cursed him endlessly      Chants of evil incantation   Fill the murky night   Free the Devil's knights of Hell   Unleash their growing spite      Directing power forcibly   The fire of Hell is cast   Resurrect from crypts of Death   A demon from the past      [Chorus]      Cringe with fear   Violate the unbroken seal of Hell   Death will come searching for   Your mere soul   Still you are eager to seek your fate   All that lie here are remains of Death      Grinding bones, screaming skulls   Broken by the lapse of time   Decay to powder, ashes to dust   Diminishing, disintegrating   Man's soul and mind      [Chorus]      Empty space tracks throughout   I make my claim      Darkness covers the world   My Kingdom, my Domain.I shed my skin   And set aside this self-made darkness   'n walk on into the light      I'm sick of this prison   I been calling my life   I finally found out the gates of hell are locked from the inside   Just like Moses   Headed for the Promised Land   We don't get to know

the fuck am I to say?.Any more than I used to be, babe..When you smile, the sun shines out of a blue sky   Rainbows burst into bloom,   People are dancing and some are romancing..Leave it all and like a man,   Come back to nothing special,   Such as waiting rooms and ticket lines,   Silver bullet suicides,   And messianic ocean tides,   And racial roller-coaster rides   And other forms of boredom advertised as poetry..Goodbye, no use leading with our chins, this is where our story ends,   Never lovers ever friends..Look her over once or twice..She was standing in the rain..Bet you think you'd escaped?"
"Regardless of if we are speaking of the religous demanding books such as the @CAPS1 @CAPS2 series to be ripped from our shelves or @CAPS3 wanting to burn the @LOCATION1, books can always bring about controversy. In this country we are given the rights to freedom of speech and press, so why can anyone demand that a book be banned? Everyone in our world has different thoughts, beliefs, morals and values so why should we try to force our own views on others? We should not. Imposing our views upon others can be done just as easily through putting a controversial book on the shelves as it can by taking it off. Music, movies and magazines are no different, all express the ideas and beliefs of their respective writer, and all deserve to be accessed by anyone who desires to do so.     Books, there are lists of hundreds of banned books and honestly you could find a dozen reasons to ban any book ever written. If you ban one writers words because they speak passionately or discretely on a controversial topic, then you must ban them all, and if you have to ban the words then you must also ban the writer so that he or she cannot voice his or her opinion. If we did this then our country and our world would be without opinion, voiceless, and without a voice their is no direction and no moving forward. If the people of our world are denied the right to write a book on their opinion then what kind of world do we live in? If you can ban my words, then I can ban yours and we have both lost our voice and our chance at somehow brightening the future.      Imagine the impact if the @CAPS4 had locked away every copy of the @CAPS5 because it brought about change and controversy. Imagine a world where we had never heard of @CAPS6 or @CAPS7. It would be a would far different from our own. A world without powerful voices influencing not only our daily actions, but hundreds of years of war, love, and hate. It would be one without direction, where people are left to wonder but never to express or discuss. It would be a terrible place.     While children should not exactly be watching porn or reading '@ORGANIZATION1', they definantly should not be kept from reading, listening to, or watching anything they desire. Values and morals should be gained by reading, discovering and thinking, not forced upon us by our government or our parents. Rap music @MONTH1 have lyrics that some would consider rude but to another they @MONTH1 speak a message. To a creationist @PERSON1's views @MONTH1 seem stupid and offensive, but to an atheist they @MONTH1 be what makes sense. We should all have access to all opinions so that we can develop our own.      We should not have the values and ideas of others beaten into our heads, we should be able to develop our own through an exploration through those of others. Censorship is wrong, our government has no business in what we choose to explore and no one should be restricted by the views of another..Would I be a fool for being long gone..Donna toki datte   Tatta hitori de   Unmei wasurete   Ikite kita no ni   Totsuzen no hikari no naka me ga sameru   Mayonaka ni   Shizuka ni deguchi ni tatte   Kurayami ni hikari wo ute   Imadoki yakusoku nante   Fuan ni saseru dake kana   Negai wo kuchi ni shitai dake sa kazoku ni mo   Shoukai suru yo   Kitto umaku iku yo   Donna toki datte   Zutto futari de   Donna toki datte   Soba ni iru kara   Kimi to iu [you] hikari ga watashi wo mitsukeru   Mayonaka ni   Urusai toori ni haitte (When you go my way)   Unmei no kamen wo tore (Take it all away)   Sakiyomi no shisugi nante   Imi no nai koto wa yamete   Kyou wa oishii mono mo tabeyou yo   Mirai wa zutto saki da yo   Boku ni mo wakaranai   Kansei sasenaide   Motto yokushite   Wanshiin zutsu totte   Ikeba ii kara   Kimi to iu [you] hikari ga watashi no shinario   Utsushidasu   Motto hanasou yo   Mokuzen no ashita no koto mo   Terebi [television] keshite   Watashi no koto dake wo   Miteite yo   Donna ni yokutta-tte   Shinjikirenai ne   Sonna toki datte   Soba ni iru kara   Kimi to iu [you] hikari ga watashi wo mitsukeru   Mayonaka ni   Motto hanasou yo   Mokuzen no ashita no koto mo   Terebi [television] keshite   Watashi no koto dake wo...

Satan's power when we were gone astray      O tidings of comfort and joy, comfort and joy   O tidings of comfort and joy      From god our heav'nly Father a blessed angel came   And unto certain shepherds brought tidings of the same   How that in Bethlehem was born the son of god by name      ""Fear not, then,"" said the angel, ""Let nothing you afright   This day is born a savior of a pure virgin bright   To free all those who trust in him from Satan's power and might""      The shepherds at those tidings rejoiced much in mind   And left their flocks a-feeding in tempest, storm and wind   And went to Bethlehem straightaway this blessed babe to find      But when to Bethlehem they came whereat this infant lay   They found him in a manger where oxen feed on hay   His mother Mary kneeling unto the Lord did pray      Now to the Lord sing praises all you within this place   And with true love and brotherhood each other now embrace   This holy tide of Christmas all others doth deface      God bless the ruler of this house, and send him long to reign   And many a merry Christmas may live to see again   Among your friends and kindred that live both far and near--   That God

"I believe everyone has their own choice when it comes to taking a book off a shelf. You should know what your picking up. If you think it might be offensive to you, then set it back on the shelf. It's as easy as that. Taking offensive articles off shevles of libraries just because a couple of people are unhappy ruins everyones opportunity on maybe finding what they were looking for.     Censorship in libraries is just uneeded. Everyone should be able to take care of themselves. Read the title before you pick up the book. It could give you a good hint on whether or not it might offend you. Children on the other hand should be overlooked by an adult just to make sure they dont pick up anything that should not be viewed as a child.      Taking offensive articles off the shelves ruins good books for everyone else. Not everyone is offended by the same material. For some it @MONTH1 be pictures. For others it could just be words. But this offensive material happens in everyday life throughout the world. It just can not be avoided. So why take it out of libraries.     If it's really offensive in any way put a warning sticker on the book. It will warn people that the book @MONTH1 contain material that @MONTH1 offend the reader of the book. It will benefit both sides of this argument. People will be less offended because they won't unexpectingly pick up a book and be offended. But the people that @MONTH1 enjoy reading the offensive books still can read them.     Everyone has their own choice when it comes to picking up a book. You should have an idea of what your picking up. Just because you made a mistake and picked up an offensive article, why take it away from others that @MONTH1 enjoy reading them. Everyone is exposed to offensive material through everyday life. So why have censorship in libraries. It's not accomplishing anything..How in the fuck you gonna tell this man not to be violent?.No time for tears   Stars don't have time to cry   No time for tears   He's just another guy   Who used your heart   But don' forget who you are      You're playing the part   The greatest movie star   So soul aches   You think it's   The end of it all      But tears always dry   And all of us lie   That's all   Yeah tears always dry   And all of us lie   That's all      Your soul aches   You cry out   You're weeping   You're while      But tears always dry   And all of us lie   Sometimes   Yeah tears always dry   And all of us lie   Sometimes   But tears always dry   And all of us lie   Sometimes?.One year I got a dog for Christmas   And I gave it to the boy next door   Then I gave him my bike and my mom's bank card   'cause that's what Christmas is for   I used to give a lot at Christmas   You might say I gave to much   Until my family was broke and we had no place to live   That's why, Christmas Sucks   I went down to the mall each Christmas   Had to the Santa what to bring   A train, a bike, a pony and a great big pile of cash   And please don't get my sister anything   But the shopping mall Santa has been drinking   His nose is red from years of drinking scotch   He probably won't remember what's on my Christmas list   This Father Christmas sucks   Chorus:   Christmas Sucks, Christmas Sucks   Getting stuff is much for fun, you gotta look out for number one   Christmas Sucks   Christmas became worse as years went by   It was the most dreaded time of year   My parents got me clothes that just weren't cool   When all I want is money to buy beer   There was a girl at church who I was sweet on   So in the Christmas play I was the ox   I really think she liked me til I stepped on Baby Jesus   Even for our savious Christmas Sucks   Chorus   Now that I am thirty-wight years old   The only things I get are ties and socks   My kids are never happy with what's under the tree   Soon they'll understand Christmas Sucks   Every freakin' year Christmas Sucks   Christmas Sucks, Christmas Sucks, Christmas Sucks.Chorus.So me and mom took the high road..Where did all these smart girls come from?.O' Glendora...O' Glendora...

"Should taking books, music, and movies off shelves of libraries even be questioned? Aa stated in our constitutuion, people have the freedom to information. People have had this luxury every since the beginning of this marvelous country. Also @CAPS1 have the choice to either pick up a type of book or not too. So to answer my question, taking types of books and movies off shelves is completely out of the question,     In the @ORGANIZATION1, it @ORGANIZATION1 that people have the freedom of speech, religion, and many others including freedom to information. Due to this reason places like libraries should have as much information as possible out on there shelves. Even if some of the conduct is inapropriate, it is still serves a way to educate. Which for children, education is largely what their childhood is for. Parents and teachers are always pushing their kids to go out, read and learn new topics other than what is being taught in the classroom or at home. If books were to be taken of the shelves, we @CAPS1 would only be depriving our youth of knowledge in the world. All books or magazines @MONTH1 benificial to some and offensive to others. However for those who would find this beneficial do we want to simply go against our @ORGANIZATION1 and deprive them of that information?     Another topic in the @ORGANIZATION1 is the freedom of choice. Even if bad books or magazines are on the shelve, children have the choice to pick them up. Parents should simply tell there kids to leave those types of materials alone and choose something else. Having books that @MONTH1 seem innapropriate to some, aren't hurting anyone by just sitting on the shelve. However some, @MONTH1 come aross a book like this and find it very interesting and decide to check it out. This action plays no effect on child who is not supossed to be viewing material like that. Finally, it is very simple to avoid this type of information, all one has to do is simply not choose to look at it and walk right by it.     As for myself, I personally as a child was not allowed to view certain types of movies, books, or magazines. For example I was restricted from watching rated @CAPS2 movies or things with innapropriate sexual actions. Since this was the case, I simply avoided those types of movies or magazines that had those types of content. For most of my childhood I did this and it was very simple. However, I don't think it would be fair to remove those types of things from other children. For the reason that it's their choice to do what ever they would like and that it has no affect on me at all. Lastly, I feel like removing certain things from libraries would be very unfair to children who have the privelage to view them.     In conclusion, removing materials,s uch as books, music, and movies is completely absurd. As I said before doing something like this, would be going against our constitutuion. The answer to solving this problem to me is black and white, children should just not pick up those types of materials end  of case.Midnight blue turned to gray..Fill the terror chamber, your mind begins to scream..Oh, with all that I've done wrong I must have done something right   To deserve her love every morning and butterfly kisses   I couldn't ask God for more, man, this is what love is   I know I've got to let her go   But I'll always remember   Every hug in the morning and butterfly kisses.[Chorus]   Adalida, pretty little Cajun queen   Sweet Dixie flower, the bell of the bayou   You're every young mans dream   Adalida, I'd walk through the hurricane   To stand beside ya sweet Adalida I'd swim the Ponchartrain      Oh no, here ya coming down the road   With your cotton dress a swishing   You're getting some attention   From all the boys in Thibodaux   Oh my, you're really filling up their eyes   Smiling and a winking   I know what they're thinking   But I'm the only one who loves you so      [Chorus]      Oh no, the hottest little dish I know   I know that you can tell it   You're making me so jealous   From my head down to my toes   Oh me, you could make a red neck green   The way that you're a looking   You got me a cooking   And I ain't talking bout Etoufee'      [Chorus: x2]      To stand beside ya sweet Adalida   To stand beside ya sweet Adalida   Just to stand beside of my sweet Adalida   I'd swim the Ponchartrain.Well, I've a big old heart,   This I know for sure,   But I don't know what my love is for..I try to say no, but it came out yes and,   Here it goes, middle of the dance floor,   We're both, pretty nervous, I can tell by look in his eyes,   Then came the count down,      [Chorus:]   5, 4, 3, 2, 1!.are you getting that, Sean?

"DO I BELIEVE THAT CERTAIN MATERIALS, SUCH AS BOOKS, MUSIC, MOVIES, MAGAZINES, ETC., SHOULD BE REMOVE FROM THE SHELVES IF THEY ARE FOUND OFFESIVE? I WOULD HAVE TO SAY NO. THE REASONE WHY I STATE THIS BECAUSE THOSE ARE THE BOOKS THAT HELP YOU THROUGH OUT YOUR LIFE. THERE ARE RUDE AND HORABLE THINGS OUT IN THE WORLD. LIFE IS NOT ALWAYS EASY AND SOME OF THOSE BOOKS WOULD HELP YOU WITH YOUR DESION MAKING. NOW THESE ARE THE REASONS WHY I THINK SO.          FIRST, HOW WOULD THE BOOK HELP OTHERS IN THE LONG RUN. I THINK IT WOULD BECAUSE SOME BOOKS TALK ABOUT THRE REAL DEAL. LIKE HOW TEENAGE GIRL BEING A  MOTHER AT A YOUNG AGE, OR HOW KIDS DONT FINISH SCHOOL AND NOW THEY ON THE STREET, IN JAIL, OR WORST. BOOKS MATERIALS LIKE THESE MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN SOMEONE LIFE OTHER THAN YOU. SO THATS ONE REASON.     SECONDLY, THESE BOOKS IS LIKE A GUIDE TO OTHERS. THE REASON WHY I SAY THAT IS BECAUSE,  IF PEOPLE READ ABOUT VOILENCE AND STUFF THEY WOULD SEE WHAT THEY DONT WANT TO  GO THREW LIKE MYSELF FOR EXAMPLE. I WAS READING THIS BOOK CALL MY HOOD. AND THIS BOOK TALK ABOUT ALOT OF STUFF THAT I HAVE SEEN WITH MY OWN EYES LIKE GANG BANGING, SEX, DRUGS, HOOD FIGHTS ETC., THAT HAPPENS IN THE REAL WORLD.     THIRDLY, MANY PEOPLE THAT I KNOW OF DONT REALLY LIKE TO GET ADVISE OR TALK TO OTHER PEOPLE ABOUT THEIR PROMBLEMS. AND THEY CAN GET A BOOK OR SOMTHING THAT HAVE THE SAME FEATURES AS WHAT THEY MIGHT BE GOING THREW. THOSE BOOKS AND THINGS IS NOT VERY BAD THEY ACTUALLY HELP. AND LIKE I SAID BEFORE THEY REALLY NOT BAD THERE LIKE A LITTLE GUIDE TO MANY PEOPLE.     SO IN CONCLUSION DO I BELIEVE THAT CERTAIN MATERIALS, SUCH AS BOOKS, MUSIC, MAGAZINE, ETC., SHOULD BE REMOVED FROM THE SHELVES IF THEY ARE FOUND OFFENSIVE. ABOSULTLY NOT BECAUSE THOSE BOOK TALKS ABOUT REAL LIFE AND LIFE IS NOT ALWAYS FAIR.When I'm down when my soul's in need of rest   Come your words of comfort and of hope   I see your face always

"I believe that some materail should be remove if very offensive. I also believe that if its helping you learn then it should stay on the shelf. Everyone, has different thoughts about was is offensive or apropreate and whats not.  Also, everyone has different ideas or expectations on if books,music,movies,magazines, and so on are apropreate. Each person should read the cover of the book and so on to see if it will be apropreate for them.And the liabary should put warning stickers on  the book, so that person knows the graphic or voulgur language. Therefore, I beleive that the laibaries should put warning signs on anything to reduce less books being removed from the shelfs.   And so forth my decision is to not remove certain materail, only if offensive. The liabaries should use warning stickers on books so that person knows ahead of time about the graphic or voulgur language. I believe this will help and reduce the problems in our liabaries. Even thought alot of people will dis agree, this is what I believe should happen.  Heres why I believe this should happen. One day when I was younger just starting to read I came across a book. I was reading it to my mother then she takes the book away and gives it to the liabarean and told what happen. I guess I said a very inapropeate word and they had no idea the book had that kind of language in it. So, now everytime my mother takes my younger brothers to the liabary she makes sure the book they want are apropeate for there age group so the same incadent wont happen again.wouldnt you be the same way with your children?

"I do not believe books, music, and magazines should be removed from shelves. Wherever you go in the world, whether you like it or not, your going to come in contact with things you don't find appropriate or you think are offensive. @TIME1 world is far from perfect. One reason i don't belive they should be removed is because it would be unconstitutional. The freedon of speech and the press was not ment to be tampered with. If a specific library thinks their articles are innapropriate, an easy solution would be to put these articles in a certain section of the library and warn people what they are.     The main reason I don't believe books, music, and magazines should be removed from the shelves is becuase the world is a nasty place and books are the least of your concerns. Kids can't be sheltered their whole lifes, they need to face reality and books are a good source of that. Kids these days are resiliant and can handle 'innapropriate' content. Parents need to face the fact that their kids are going to be exposed to offensive things in @TIME1 imperfect world of ours. It's just a natural part of growing up.     Another contributing factor is that it would be unconstitutional to remove books and other articles from the shelves of @LOCATION1's libraries. When the amendments freedom of speech and press were written down they were intended to stay there. They are not guidlines that can be looked over, they are rules set in stone for @TIME1 great country. People to @TIME1 for freedom over much bigger issues than books. Who are we to tell people what they can and can't write down. People's natural opinions can't and shouldn't be governed. I think it would be a crime against @LOCATION1 to censor things in libraries.     My final reason for not censoring libraries is that it all boils down to the people running the library. If they think some of their articles are profound and innapropriate, meerly isolate them to a certain section of the library and put a warning for people to see. If people don't want to be offended they simply have to just stay away from these sections. Take responsibilty for what is in these libraries that is apparently so offending and put them in their own area and stay away from them, do not take them out completely, because who knows someone @MONTH1 want that offending book.     These are all supporting opinions why I personally do not belive libraries should be censored. @TIME1 world is far from perfect and it's not going to become perfect by censoring libraries. Plus @TIME1 act would be completely unconstitutional. Finally all the libraries have to do is exile these articles to certain areas of the libraries and slap a warning on them.

"With new things coming out these days, I, @PERSON1, believe that all things out in libraries should have a certain organization for certian subjects. I am not asking for any removal or destorying of books, magazines, or anything that is in the libraries but I am asking for a fair hearing of my opinion.     I would like more organization for certian things, I do know people have their own ideas about things that should be in a book. These books found in a library could bring enjoyment to people, but sometimes can offence other people.  So, with this way I would really like if there was a scale, or organization of books.      So with that, people who dont like certain subjects could easily stay away from the books that they do not like. If there is a scale factor of these books, music, magazines, or movies, you can just have a number or a letter symbolizing the certain catagories. Even though, I, personally think it is alittle worse than a different organization, it would atleast worn people of these things.     If you were to deside that either way would be better so then less complaining people would be wanting all books destroyed. I think that organizing the books in a different way would be better. This would be a lot of work but, thinking of a mother of a child could easily keep them away from books the mother would not even touch herself.     I would not like any books removed from libraries. This is because if you start taking one out of the library, that my offence someone, I believe you will start taking out more than one. With this thought I think it will come down to either everyone complaining about a certain book in the library to no library at all. So please, please think about organizing the books, magazes, movies, music, and more so then this will not happen in the future. Thank you for your time to read this, I hope you can find a way of going in to this subject more.

"The material that someone people believe shouln't be viewed by childern, I don't believe should be removed from the library shelves just for that reason.     The library is not just for the children but also for the adults. Children are exposed to many things everyday that are not suited for them, whether it be in their home, at school, or even while their out in public. So why alter the library just for the children, when we don't even alter the public for them? I think if having certain material that isn't suitable for certain ages, then the children should be monitored closely on what they are pulling from shelves. By pulling something from a shelf just because a parent doesn't want their child to see, hear, or watch it, isn't right to the older people that come to the library.     Another reason i don't agree with removing things is because, by removing items that are not suited for a child is like saying we should move the childrens things off of shelves, because the adults have no use for them. Their are always many ways to suit both the needs of a child and the needs of an adult in a library, and still keep the children from what they shouldn't read. Most children are so amused by their own materials in the library they are not worried about the adult things. If everything a parent didn't want their child to see ws pulled from the selves, then there would be no use for the older people to come to the library. Their only custmors left would be the children, and that wouldn't be much business, because the parent's wouldn't want to stay because they wouldn't have anything to entertain them for the toe being.     There are always ways to make both side of the situatation fair. I just don't believe removing material not suited for children is the right thing to do..Who created the enemy!?.I   Owe you an apology too many thanks and that's not all..Can't take my eyes off you..copy?.I was crazy when I said I didn't love you,   From the first time that I ever saw you,   The emotions running deep underneath my skin,   Sign anywhere for your love, where do we begin..I wonder why he hung up?.Hello   How are you?.Drowning in every kiss..Just a few old memories   Slipped in through my door   Though I thought I had closed it   So tightly before   I can't understand it   Why it should bother my mind   For it all belongs to another place and time      Just a few old keep-sakes   Way back on the shelf   No, they don't mean nothin'   Well I'm surprised they're still left   Just a few old love letters   With the edges all brown   And an old faded picture   I keep turned upside-down      Just a few old memories   Going way back in time   Well I can hardly remember   I don't know why I'm cryin'   I can't understand it   Well I'm surprised myself   First thing tomorrow morning   I'll clean off that shelf      Just a few old keep-sakes   Way back on the shelf   No, they don't mean nothin'   Well I'm surprised that they're left   Just a few old love letters   With their edges all brown   And an old faded picture   I keep turned upside-down.I am looking for someone, who can take as much as I give,   Give back as much as I need,   And still have the will to live..How do you plead?

"Censorship is a contraversal topic. Some believe that it is necessary others would disagree. My personal opinion would be that censorship is not necessary. Everyone is entitles to what they believe, and others have to have the maturity to accept that.     Censorship is not necessary because if you are offended by some material then don't read or listen to it. It is as simple as that. Everyone can be offended by something, so if everything was removed that was found to be offensive to someone there would be nothing left. If things were organized into sections that stated how offensive the material was then it is likely that almost everything would be in the offensive section.     Because censorship is contraversal there are many different thoughts on the subject. It ranges from no censorship to complete censorship, my view be just one of many. Censorship is truely just a matter of maturity and how a person goes about dealing with the material. The only person who can let you be offened is yourself, therefore censorship is not necessary in the library people just need to be mature about it..Each day was a gift   You told me, ""slow,   Before I move on   You must remember each day is a gift."".[Chorus:]   She had Hennessey hips, and Belve' eyes   Grey Goose on her lips, and cognac thighs   I'm hungover (hungover) from Ms..After which the Neolithic age,   Was terrific..Turn on your TV,   Turn down your pulse,   Turn away from it all,   It's all getting too much..Poor Jud is daid   Poor Jud Fry is daid   All gather round his coffin now and cry   He had a heart of gold   And he wasn't very old   Oh why did such a fella have to die      Poor Jud is daid   Poor Jud Fry is daid   He's looking oh so peaceful and serene      And serene!.I handed her up on the wagon,   And I loaded up her trunk behind,   She was sitting up there with the gold in her hair,   I tried to get a hope on my mind..God knows I'd hate to see you   go away..Making a date for   Later by phone   And if you're alone   I'll come home..they turning beef to eighty packs of bologne   They waited on me, telling when its my time to cool it   Blue chevey sit tall, like a colorado moose do   My cookies drown like moons too, my regal look like prune juice   Why should I be bishop, I'm drizzled, I got my own juice   Own crew, own 26s on my own coop   Own crib, own bricks, plus I own a couple chicks   Know how to put bitches on they own, let her suck a dick   Hey one when one look biggin, they gotta be licking pussy   Money push it, bitch we got a avalanch block   With mo cocain then they can pull off of tha dock   Cut em off, viro ain't bitches ain't a thang   In tha chair with tha brains gettin brains, diamonds on my chain      [Chorus x2]   [Verse 2].Wait I wasn't finished      [Chorus]      Do you think it's normal   For white people to wear dreadlocks?.(Nettie)   When you walk through a storm   Keep your chin up high   And don't be afraid of the dark      When you walk through a storm   Keep your chin up high   And don't be afraid of the dark   At the end of the storm   Is a golden sky   And the sweet, silver song of the lark      (Chorus sings with Nettie)      Walk on through the wind   Walk on through the rain   Though your dreams be tossed and blown   Walk on, walk on with hope in your heart   And you'll never walk alone   You'll never walk alone.We search for outside conclusions to questions we have inside   We search for logical solutions to problems we cannot hide   We hope and pray the curse of war will be undone   And that the world will be as one   But we can't change it on our own, it takes more   Chorus:   Then and only then can we live in perfect harmony   Only if and when we sacrifice our comfort for the least of these   Get together down on our knees and pray God give us peace   Then and only then   We need to stop looking on ourselves and look to the One who know all   He has the answers that can rebuild us, a foundation that will not fall   We hope and pray the curse of hate will be no more   But it may be different   At least we know what the power of prayer is for, let's unite   (chorus)   We know it's gonna take time to get it together, to follow it through   But if we try a little bit harder, just think what we could do   If we only knew   (chorus out).Red flowers bursting down below us..Well, fuck it, now you're learnin'      How, I don't even like your motherfuckin' profile   Give me my fuckin' shit, ch-ch bloaw!.I hit the bottom with a 'huh!'.And tell me do you laugh yourself to sleep?.Where are the bees?.Was a young man proud and true   Just a simple boy with nothing else to lose   Years that I've wasted these I owe you's   They're just fucking words   This is life or death   It's time to clear the air you better save your breath   Say have you heard   Say have you heard   The poison in my heart and the voices in my head   Years that I've waited these I owe you's   I meant every word for word for word forward..You must always remember   Life can be a challenge   Life can seem impossible   It's never easy, when so much is on the line      But you can make a difference   With courage you can set things right   The gift to dream and make dream real,   Is yours and mine      The power of one!.[Stephanie]   I promise..Rage Hard!.Somebody say ih hih ih hih ih      Yitho omanqoba (ih hih ih hih ih) yitho omanqoba   Esanqoba lonke ilizwe   (ih hih ih hih ih) Yitho omanqoba (ih hih ih hih ih)   Esanqoba phakathi e England   Yitho omanqoba   Esanqoba phakathi e London   Yitho omanqoba   Esanqoba phakathi e England      Somebody say ih hih ih hih ih   Somebody sing hello, hello, hello   Somebody say ih hih ih hih ih   Somebody cry why, why, why?"
"I do not think that anything is really offincive so i wouldn't really care what they have on the shelves. I do not easily get affended so i don't know what some things would be offincive but i guess that black poeple would be offincive of a rasist book?     I don't think that porn or anything involving nudety should be used in school library's because some parents are very stricked about that kind of stuff and that is very inapropriet for school. I think some parents take it over the top with whats inapropriet and what's not. Library's that are just public library's are totally diffrent and should be able to have any movies and any books. It should not be a big deal on what there about. If the people don't like it they don't need too look at it or get it.      So, i think that library's should have all diffrent kinds of books and movies. If the people don't like it then they can leave, and don't have too worry about it.

"I personally think that certain materials that are found offensive should not be removed from shelves. I think this because it's parent's responsibilities to keep track of what their children read, watch, or listen to. You can't get away from things that are offensive to some and everybody has a right to do what they want.     The first reason why I don't think offensive material should be removed from shelves is because it is the parents duty to watch what their kids are doing. If parents don't want their children to observe this stuff, then they should keep it off limits. I have heard some parents claim that they didn't know what the material was like, but that is why they made warnings. That is no excuse.      The second reason for not removing offensive material is that there is no way to get away from it. Now a days, material that is offensive to some is all around. Shows, movies,and music, they all have something not suitable for all audiences. Plus children will learn about this offensive material sometime in their life anyway. If they do not hear about it in movies or magazines, they are probably hearing about it at school. These days children learn about things sooner and sooner.        The third reason offensive material should not be removed from shelves is that everyone has a right to read or listen to whatever they want. It is up to them as to what they want to watch, not everybody else. They should be able to go in a place and buy something that they want to watch and not get questioned about it.     That is why I don't think offensive material should be removed. It is the parent's responsibilities, you can't get away from it, and everybody has a right to do what they want. A way to help with this problem is to move offensive material to a higher shelf. This would make parents of younger children happy, but also the people wanting to view this material happy. This way you are not completely removing it, but making it harder for younger audiences to get to it.Rosemary you're part of me   You know you are, you are, you are   Rosemary you're part of me   You

"From the point of view of a student, books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should not be removed from shelves just because of the material it contains. I read, watch, and listen to things everyday that my parents my not be too thrilled about, but it hasn't changed the person I am today. You can't escape things like drugs, sex, and other explicit things that we might not want our children reading about. It's in society. These things are everywhere, and just taking these materials off the shelves are not going to solve the problem. I think that we have a freedom to read about, listen, or watch whatever we would like, and removing these things takes away our freedom. I think that inappropriate books, music, movies, magazines, and etc., should not be taken off the shelves.      '@CAPS1' items are all over society. It's everywhere you look. Billboards, signs, books, magazine, music, television, movies, etc., but taking things like books, movies, music, and magazines off the shelves are not going to stop the inappropriate behavoir. Everyone in society is still going to act this way, whether you can stop your children from hearing about it or not. You still have commercials, billboards, etc. What are you going to do? Ban your children from life in general? No, I don't think so.      Reading, listening, learning, about this stuff isn't going to make your child a horrible person. I personally think, at a certain age, they need to know about this stuff. For example, I'm a good student, I behave well outside of school, I have good friends, and I get along with my family. I also read every single one of @PERSON1 books. All of them are about people who do drugs, are suicidal, and do sexual related things. These books are extremely good. Definitely the best books I've ever read, but reading these books hasn't changed who I am. I don't do drugs, I'm not into sexual things, so why would it hurt if I read books about it?      From my experience, reading these things are honestly kind of helpful. It takes you deeper into things. Everyone knows the basic learning you get in school, which is extremely @CAPS2. Reading these books, and listening to this kind of music, and watching these kinds of movies, takes a whole different point of view. Back to my experience with the @PERSON1 books, you read stories that are based off of her life and relationship with her daughter. Crank, @CAPS3, and @CAPS4 is a trilogy of books that show the life of @LOCATION1. You see the struggle, the hurt, and the pain the family goes through as @PERSON2 starts to walk with the monster, also known as @CAPS5. Reading these books makes me realize that I don't want to ever put myself through the things @PERSON2 does to herself, and her family. It gives a whole new look on things. After reading these, I believe I won't ever do 'offensive' things.      From my experiences as a student, I don't believe taking offensive material off the shelves is necessary. It gives a deeper look into information about these things. Also, you can't escape explicit material. These things are a part of life, something you can't run and hide from. You just have to accept the fact that it's there, and it's not going away. If you think your children are going to start doing those kinds of things after reading them, talk to them about it. You can't protect your children from offensive material. At least not forever.We can save this....The silent fall of evening snow   Another thing you can't control   Does it chill or warm you soul tonight   You've become a mystery   Will I earn your honesty   I'll never know if we agree   If you're not here   And we travel separate roads   And we carry different loads   And in the end we stay or go   The long goodbye continues on   Through fog and rain and far beyond   You stay awhile and then you're gone again   I look into your restless eyes   You turn away it's no surprise   I wonder if it's even wise but I'm still here.Too many problems, oh why

looking bare   Where's that valentine, be honest,   The postman didn't bring it here   The thing I wasn't looking for   I found in your bedroom drawer   The letter that you loved her better,   Made me want you even, more      And too much love's not good for you   Your heart can get too full   And too much love's an iou   And if I give you that, you'll   Send me the blues..What if you could look

things are better left unsaid   I'm afraid of the truth   But what can I do if I still want you      If we could start over again   I know if we try our love could be stronger   If we could start over again   I'm sure, we oh   We'd never have to let go      For so many years now   I've held inside things I meant to say   But faced with the past now I realize   I can't let that stand in our way      I never knew that a love so strong would never fade   But what can we do   If I still want you   And you want me too      How can we walk away   From something that was once so strong   Have we the strength to say we're wrong.Yes, the barnyard was jumpin'   Everybody havin' their fling   Even Old MacDonald   Had to do a little kind o' swing   ""Bow wow"" said the dog in the circus top

"In libraries, is censorship truly needed? I believe there should be some censorship to some extent.     Libraries are usually pretty good at sorting things. I mean, they do use the @ORGANIZATION1 in every library I've been in. But even when they do sort the books, music, and magazines by topic, there's always something offensive that can fit in that topic as well.     I remember as a child of seven or eight going to the library all the time with my mother. I realized I was getting too old for the 'kiddy book section,' so I ventured forth to places I've never been before. Any isle of books was open to anyone, I felt that I had the world in the palm of my hand.      Most of the books were too mature of a read for me anyways, butt I still looked through them all. I mean, it was something very new to me; almost like an adventure. Then, I came across the music.     There were so many inappropriate titles, cover-arts, and even names of bands. But this perked my curiosity. I remember thinking to myself, 'were books this way too?' I soon found out yes, they were. There were even doctor books with graphic images. The worst were books with cuss words that I found. Innocence in the library was gone.     I think libraries should have a different section for older, more mature people; not including children. Some people loves books, and will open any book just to read or look at the pictures. Libraries need to realize that. I was once that little kid who opened the wrong book, at the wrong time.    In conclusion, I think libraries should have at least some censorship. I understand that people enjoy the books and music that once terrored me, but I think there should be something done about it.Nine-fo' (keep bangin)      To all the ladies in the place with style and grace   Allow me to lace these lyrical douches, in your bushes   Who rock grooves and make moves with all the mommies   The back of the club, sippin' Moet, is where you'll find me (what?).Toile   Va jusqu'o?.Send 'em to tha seventh level!.A little bit of fun,   For your soul, for your soul..Please be his ex and be my bride   Don't blame it on yourself, sweet thing, you tried   Love you claimed to share just wasn't there   You're too good for that, and it wasn't fair   Love's taken its toll, your heart he stole   You was fooled by the face of a phoney role   But I'll take up the slack, support you, baby   Now the knight in shiny armor can only be me   I cry out your name as you hold his hand   If you're not mine soon, girl, my soul is damned   I'm looking out the window at the stormy rain   And the rush of the water makes my eyes drain   All alone in the room, and it's making me sad   Fantasize of the love we could have had   Cause I never met anyone like you before   And I can give you more      I pour wine for two, even though it's just me   I tried to reach you, but blind men don't see   Your man is the devil, but he gave you a ring   So you believe you saw an innocent angel sing   You're the type that ignores the destiny of two   It's not Romeo and Juliet, it's me and you   You're being handicapped by a Don Juan rap   You can hope I disappear, girl, but I'll be back   Cause I never met anyone like you before   And I can give you more   Yes girl, I never met anyone like you before   And I can give you more      The time has come, the decision's yours   This super love story ain't working no more   Can't you understand that my love spans   Higher and further than any man's   You're looking a gift horse right in the mouth   This time hear me out, I don't care if you pout   You're my only desire, I fight to the death   And I'ma scream your name when I breathe my last breath   Ain't getting on my knees, but I'm oh so close   To our love I toast, all he does is boast   Cause I never met anyone like you before   And I can give you more      A knock on the door and a tap on the glass   Tells me you see it my way at last   You used to reject me, now you wanna kiss me   He called you up and said, ""Yo baby, why you diss me?"".Boo-ya!.I'm gonna make a change   For once in my life   It's gonna feel real good   Gonna make a difference   Gonna make it right      As I, turn up the collar on   My favorite winter coat   This wind is blowing my mind   I see the kids in the streets   With not enough to eat   Who am I to be blind?.(Mm, hemp?).I just don't enjoy it as much now..She's calling up her old boyfriends   I'm falling in love with her again   She's looking for a change of pace,she says   I can see that old look on her face   She says it takes an open mind   I think she means an open relationship   She says I can be so unkind   All I said was...

"The quote from the author Katherine Paterson is very true , I believe that if we were to remove everything in the world that we took offense to then there really wouldn't be anything left in the world to gaze upon.      I remember when I was younger and  I had just gotten off of school one evening and had decided to go downtown to our town's library , I needed a book for my school project on the holocaust and I remember one of the ladies working there telling me that the book should be removed from the shelves because it was offensive to jewish people. I had at first been a little bit outraged that she would tell the person checking out the book that it should be taken from the shelves mostly because since I'm the one going to read it why would you whine about it to me in the first place plus it's more offensive to tell the person that they shouldn't check out the book that they want to read then it is to the jewish.      Another time something like this occured was when I was in @ORGANIZATION1 and one of the customers was complaining about some religious magizine that they shouldn't be aloud to sell because some of the articles were very offensive to people of certain religions. The customer who complained was taken straight up to the managers office because he actually ripped a couple of the magazines in half , talk about having issues , anyway the customer was kicked out to say the least and had to pay for the magazines they'd destroyed as well.      There has been a lot of times in my life where someone has decided to speak out about their dislikes of something and although they put up a good argument they're lacking in a couple of important things , one of which is the fact that most of the things people complain that need to be taken from the shelves have something to do with history and another thing is there are not enough people complaining about it.      But the quote by Katherine Paterson is like a knock at the door , it speaks of what could happen if we removed everything from our shelves that are offensive to others and when I read that quote the first thing that pops into my head is another quote , ' @CAPS1 speak louder than words '.Shovel shit?.I'll never tire of it --   Leading this merry dance..Feed the baby, grease the car,   Powder my nose at the same time..Nothing changes, nothing ever will   Every year another brat, another mouth to fill..It's you and me, babe, against the world..Makes you so sick at heart, that you can't take part,   You can't even passively take part..The clock is ticking, the end is coming, there'll be no warning,   But will we live to see the dawn..Hit you long range, high powered, 30-30 shit   If you never heard of a heavy assault rifle   Hit targets a mile away from the top of the Eiffel (woo!).I know I'll never get over you   So deep this feeling that I have for you   Your eyes pierce through my heart   Your smile tears me apart   I knew it, it's so true   I'll never get over you      You touch me making my heart race   So much was written on your face   I knew when you arrived   That no words could describe   What your love made me do   I'll never get over you      Girl, you're so much heart and soul   Girl, was a moonlit night you came into my life   And now this feeling has grown   And if you leave me alone I know   I'll never get over you      So hide the moments when I feel blue   You warm the coldest feet   Can cool me in the heart   And all though love was new   I'll never get over you   My understanding grew   But I'll never get over, never get over you.Can I believe these spells I feel?.I'm talking to, you      I've got a one tracked mind..Major Monogram: All rightly then..She started a heat wave   By letting her seat wave   In such a way that   The customers say that   She certainly can can-can..Open up your heart..There's nowhere to hide in your dreams..Look at this world   It's filled with worn out places   Forgotten faces   And nothing changes      Whatever happened   To that new day rising   We're just surviving   And living is dying      Are you tired   Of being let down   Another day   Another shakedown      I'm with you   We hope is gone   All you want is the truth   (I'm with you)   You carry on   when it seems no use   I'm with you      I'm with you   If I got one thing   I got something to prove   We all got nothing   If there's nothing to lose   (I'm with you)      I walk in shadows   That seem all familiar   I've read the papers   A life forsaken      A mumble some from   I'm one more for sale sign   Down on Main street   You just walk by      How many times you gotta   Break down   Before somebody's   Gonna shout out   I'm with you      We hope is gone   All you want is the truth   (I'm with you)   You carry on   When it seems no use   I'm with you      If I got one thing   I got something to prove   We all got nothing   If there's nothing to lose   (I'm with you)      When hope is gone   And all you want is the truth   (I'm with you)   You carry on   When it seems no use   It seems no use, It seems no use      When I got one thing   I got something to prove   We all got nothing   If there's nothing to lose   (I'm with you)   (I'm with you)   (I'm with you)   (I'm with you)   (I'm with you).Spoken: Shut Up!.Lucille   You don't do your daddy's will   Lucille   You don't do your daddy's will   There ain't nothing to you but I love you still      Lucille   Please come back where you belong   Lucille   Please come back where you belong   I've been good to you baby   Please don't leave me alone      I woke up this morning lucille was not in sight   I asked my friends about her but all their lips were tight   Lucille you don't do your daddy's will   Well there ain't nothing to you but I love you still      I love you lucille   I woke up this morning lucille was not in sight   I asked my friends about her but all their lips were tight   Lucille please come back where you belong   Well I've been good to you baby   Please don't leave me alone   'cause I've been good to you baby please don't leave me alone      Lucille I love you   Lucille I've been good to you baby   Don't leave me   Better come back to me girl   Lucille   Don't leave me waiting here   Been good to you baby   Been good-lucille.You tell me little lamb   Tell me it is   Tell me it is   You're my only chance to believe in love      Ba gdi, ba gdi, ba gdi, ba gdi katan   Ba gdi, ba gdi, ba gdi, ba gdi katan   Ba gdi, ba gdi, ba gdi, ba gdi katan   Ba gdi, ba gdi, ba gdi, ba gdi katan...

"My views on cencorship @MONTH1 not  be what others believe. With a good understanding of what the majority of people would call innapropriate, evaluating what books should be placed on the shelfs is easier. Although many people @MONTH1 think that a certain book is appropriate, others @MONTH1 disagree. That's why creating a rating system would be best.     With a rating system of books, movies, magazines, and other materials in a library, parents would have a better understanding of what they want their child to read or watch. If there is vulgar language inside of the book, it could be labeled with a rating and an explanation of why the book is rated the way it is. That way, if there are complaints of the item, the library would not be blamed.      I personally don't think that getting rid of materials because of others' complaints should occur. I believe that the books could be kept, but labeled or even placed on a different section of shelves to reference that they @MONTH1 be more innapropriate than the normal. What happens when a college student needs a book that is mandatory for his class and the book is banned because of 'innapropriate usage'? There is no way of making everyone completely satisfied, but with this system a lot of issues would be resolved.     My views on cencorship @MONTH1 not be what others believe, but taking away perfectly written books is not right. Disagreement isn't the easiest thing, but just because it's hard doesn't mean you have to give up. The rating system would decrease the complications and help others to be more free with their decisions.Achin' with the feelin' of the freedom of an eagle when she flies..Well I don't know if it makes you happy   But it must be healthy   'Cause it's certified..Hands over my head thinking 'what else could go wrong?

I jump and scream and shout   Hoping I can drown it out   But instead I trip and fall   And bash my head upon a wall   Wait a second where'd it go?.Hey you got what I like..Let it fall down, let it fall down, let it all fall down..Like a bird on a wire   Like a drunk in a midnight choir   I have tried in my way to be free   Like a fish on a hook   Like a knight in an old fashioned book   I have

"Who is to label a book offensive? What one might find appauling, others @MONTH1 find a novel or passage to be rather interesting. All books and other arts were created to be read and enjoyed by people. Libraries banning books, music, movies, or magazines seems unreasonable since there is such a wide variety of people and their interests.          Books such as The @CAPS1, The @CAPS2's @CAPS3, and @CAPS4 @CAPS5 have been removed from many library shelves. Though people @MONTH1 check these books out, many others find them either offensive or think they should not mix with every day books. I have read a decent amount of each of the above readings, and have found the books to be full of remarkable things which have taught me a lot. If books are banned from libraries, it almost seems as if they're limiting our education.      Why would a book be published, or written for that matter, if we were not intended to read it? Any book could be offensive to any one person. Any article, song, or film could be offensive. But, there will always be a crowd it appeals to. And that crowd deserves to enjoy every last word. Censorship in libraries has gone on too long, it is time for the world to freely take part in the literature that interests them.               The solution to library censorship is the division of books into categories and sub-categories. First by subject, down to the author. Therefore, books that @MONTH1 be offensive are listed as such, but are still available to those who want to read them.      Censorship in libraries takes away from individual freedom every day. People should be able to read what they enjoy and not be ridiculed for it. All books are written to be read, and with the division of such books, everyone can agree upon this: books help us grow.

"People have a choice on the types of literature they want to read wether it offends them or not the chose to read it. Books should not be removed from the shelves of libraries.They need to try to avoid the books that @MONTH1 be offensive to them. Now if they cant then thats not the libraries fault. Books should not be removed for many reasons.     One of the many reasons books should not be removed is because they know the risk they take when entering a library, and that's their decision that they are making and sometimes decisions have consequences. When and if they are offended, they will know the types of books that offened them so they would just have to do a little better job of avoiding those books.     Another reason would be the libraries dont know what offends people it can be one little thing in a book but that doesn't mean that book should be removed from the shelfs. Also just cause one person tihnks its offensive doesn't mean that others will. People arn't all offended by the same thing some people are offended by little things, meaning they're offended easily, some arn't offended so easy, that means it make take more serious things than a book to offend a person.     Another reason books shouldnt be removed is because students need them for projects and school assignments. Some school assignments require you getting a little offended exspecially if your african american and you get an assignment on slavery or something during that time. But we need to learn about past experiences and our history and we couldnt do that if some people are trying to remove some of those books from the shelf. You @MONTH1 get offended but there is no reason to remove that book that others will need at sometime.Find another way to solve that problem.     There are other ways to solve problems like these such as tagging the books with a yellow small sticker so it would warn people that the book offended someone. There is no need to completly remove the book. Another solution would be to maybe seperate the books, meaning put the books in a diffrent location of the library if the get more than a couple complaints of being offensive. Also when someone check out a book the librarian can warn them that the book has been tagged with a yellow sticker and its possible that it @MONTH1 offend them. Thats why removing books from shelves arn't cause for..Remember,   Softly, softly we met with a kiss..And how do you do the things you do to you?.A winning smile of gleaming teeth   W.O..Zoot suit, [etc.].La la la la la la la   La la la la la la..Voices cryin' out, voices cryin' out   Voices cryin' out in the night hear them call   Voices cryin' out hear them call   It's a night   Like no other night   It's a day   Almost turning gray   It's a heart   Like a broken heart   It's a wheel   At the end of day   It's the plight   Of a boy who's scared   Of the waves rushing out   And the wind in the air   It's the sight   Of one longing to taste   Of life   Voices crying out in the night hear them call   Voices from some foreign shore   Visions that seem an incredible dream   Echoing for more   Voices crying out in the night hear them call   Voices crying out hear them call   It's a song   Of a love unsung   It's the pain   Of just being young   It's a cry   Of a voice unheard   Of a face   Speaking silent words   It's the hope   That the time goes by   Take you upon a wing   Teach your soul to fly   It's a wish   That you'll live your experience life   Voices crying out in the night hear them call   Voices from some foreign shore   Vision that seem an incredible dream   Echoing for more   Voices crying out in the night hear them call   Voices crying out hear them call   Oh do you know how it feels to be free   Walking your path of life   Embracing destiny one day at a time   Voices cryin' out...oh can't you hear them   Voices cryin' out...listen please, listen to the future   Voices cryin' out...millions and millions and millions of voices   Voices cryin' out...oh oh oh oh   Voices crying out in the night hear them call   Voices from some foreign shore   Vision that seem an incredible dream   Echoing for more   Voices crying out in the night hear them call   Voices crying out hear them call   Voices crying out in the night hear them call   Voices from some foreign shore   Vision that seem an incredible dream   Echoing for more   Voices cryin' out   Voices cryin' out   Voices cryin' out....I can feel your arms around me like it was yesterday   I can feel your breathing next to me and hear your laughter gay   You tried to tell me what was right and I told you what was real   All I ever live for now is this piece of wood and steel      In a world that's full of trouble a world that's full of pain   Lord many fall beside the road and they never rise again   Many more are bending low or broken at the wheel   All I need to carry on is this piece of wood and steel      I was born my mother's only son she loves me all she can   But there isn't much to say to her since I became a man   And I often met the devil but I never made a deal   I just thank the Lord for hands to play this piece of wood and steel      It's face is scarred and beaten like the ragged clothes I wear   Like the body that God gave me I might give it better care   But I play it for the ladies and I play it for a meal   I play the strings just to hear 'em ring of this piece of wood and steel      I'm growing tired of searching now there's nothing much I crave   Give or take a little time and you can write it on my grave   There's nothing more I care to own nothing left to feel   All I ever wanted was this piece of wood and steel      I can feel your arms around me like it was yesterday   I can feel your breathing next to me and hear your laughter gay   You tried to tell me what was right and I told you what was real   All I ever live for now is this piece of wood and steel   In a world that's full of trouble a world that's full of pain   Lord many fall beside the road and they never rise again   Many more are bending low or broken at the wheel   All I need to carry on is this piece of wood and steel      I was born my mother's only son she loves me all she can   But there isn't much to say to her since I became a man   And I often met the devil but I never made a deal   I just thank the Lord for hands to play this piece of wood and steel   (I'll be playing this guitar till the day I die).I'd give her the love she needs, the dreams...

"One @MONTH1 walk into a library, look over at a magzine rack and think, '@CAPS1 is that in the young adult section, the content of that book is not age appropriate?' In many libraries, some books are not censored and catagorized the way they should. In some of the reading material, one might not even realize that some inappropriate things are in it. Supervision of children and young adults are not always looked upon, and some of these people might not even know what they are checking out. Censorship needs to be pushed more in libraries.      In most libraries, the catagories for books are children, young adult, adult books by genere, magazines, and music, but what needs looked upon is what is on the inside covers of those books. Some magazine articles are not appropriate for some teens, even if it does claim to be age appropriate. I remember when I was fourteen, I read a series that was related to colors off the color weel. Each one covered a different topic such as suicide, alcholism, drugs, sex, same sex dating, and jealousy. Looking back on it, I am surprised I was allowed to check them out at the library. A fourteen year old didn't need to read books on such heavy topics.Also, language in books and music maybe unappropriate for children, and @MONTH1 be distasteful and disrespectful for some adults. The catagories need to be catogorized even more, so people further know what they are getting into when checking out a book or magazine.      When a child goes up to check out a book they found, a librarian sometimes doesn't even pay attention to the book they are getting, they simply check it out. Libraries should have a rating system like movies do. Generally people would not let their ten-year-old go to a movie rated @NUM1, @CAPS2 or that is unrated, so @CAPS1 would they let their child get a book holding the same content? If books had a rating system, that ten-year- old would not get their hands on a book rated '@CAPS2' or '@CAPS4' for mature.     In libraries there is not as much supervision as their needs to be. I am aware that libraries are not day-care center and the librarians are not babysitters, but there also needs to be stricter guidelines, because some people are not fully aware of what their children or what they, themselves, are reading. For example, a thirteen-year-old girl wants to check out @CAPS5 magazine, because her best friend's older sister gets it. The girl's mother allows it because it probably won't be too bad and she assumes her daughter wants to look at the pictures of new clothes and trends. What the mother @MONTH1 not realize is in the middle of the magazine contains an article about sex and protection, and that @MONTH1 open a whole new world for the little girl. Even though the mother shouldn't have had let her daughter check out the magazine, if the guidelines were stricter at the library the girl might have never have read that article. Even if librarians had to check or scan a person's library card to make sure they can be in the section or be reading a certain book, it would be protecting many more people then it would be hurting.     If libraries censored books better, then children and teens @MONTH1 not be reading things not age appropriate to them. I'@CAPS4 not saying that books should be removed off the shelf, just maybe put up higher, and be watched over more carefully.When we were lovers you called me names   But time goes on and you were

"No, I don't think that books or any other material should be taken off shelves in libraries just because some people might find them offensive.  I think that if a parent sees something that they do not want their child reading, then it is in their right to not allow that child read it, but it is unfair to take it off the shelf entirely.  That book that has been marked 'offensive' could have been a way for another person to learn about that book and possibly gain something out of it.  There are some non-fiction books out there that can marked as 'offensive', and they are just that non-fiction.  It is something that really happen and anyone can learn something from it by reading it, and to take it away would be taking away the knowledge that another person could have obtained.      I believe that in a library people should have a choice to read what they choose and not have it ripped off the shelf just because parents don't want their child reading it.  I think that if they do not want their child to read it, then the parents can tell that child that they don't want them reading that and then everybody wins.  I know that I have read some non-fiction books that would be marked by some people as offensive, but with that book I also learned much about the topic at hand.  To take away that book would be showing that you care only about how it might be offensive to some people and not how it could help extend the knowledge of another.  If we are to take away every book that might have a racial slur here or an act of violence there, what would we have left our children to read and to learn from.  They read these books and they can find out how that racial slur or act of violence as hurt someone emotionaly and physicaly, and that they should never do it in fear of the concicence that they might have to face later on.       Overall, I think that the books and other material in libraries should be kept on the shelves, and if someone finds it offensive or anything else they shouldn't read it and not deprive someone of that knowledge.  We live in a world today where education is everything, and we think that everyone should have an education.  But if we take away every book that a person does not like then what do we have left to learn from..Falling over myself, the televisions on,   I turn it off and smile..I will build you a castle with a tower so high   Till it reaches the moon   I'll gather melodies from birdies that fly   And compose you a tune   Give you lovin' as warm as Mama's oven   And if that don't do   Then I'll try something new   I'll try something new      I will take you away with me as far as I can   To Venus or Mars   There we will love with your hand in my hand   You'll be king of the stars   Every day we can play on the Milky Way   And if that don't do   I'll have to try something new   I'll try something new      I will bring you a flower from the floor of the sea   To wear in your hair   (Thank you)   I'll do anything and every little thing to make you happy, boy   To show you that I care   I'll pretend I'm jealous of all the fellas   And if that don't do   Then I'll try something new   I'll try something new.Mother Mary won't you whisper   Something but what's past and done..I can see your eyes   And almost hear your lovely lies..She said ""I'll throw myself away,   They're just photos after all""   I can't make you hang around..Help me please!.Your reputation's bad and it's getting worse   You couldn't get a dollar for what your word is worth   Your bad luck runs you down like bad boys at your heels   But I could never deny your eyes begging for one more meal      Sister wild rose, it's the hard road   But you and I know you can't ever let go      You took it a long long way   You back out and faith doing up   All that good good stuff thinking   It was worth the trade      You let hold you down   You let tear you apart   And hold you in them   Dirty hands squeeze your hostage heart      Sister wild rose, it's the hard road   But you and I know you can't ever let go   Keep your love alive, it keeps you warm at night   Coming from the cold, my sister wild rose      La, la, la, la, la   La, la, la, la, la      Oh no, no, sister wild rose, it's the hard road   But you and I know you can't ever let go   No, keep your love alive, Lord, it keeps you warm at night   Coming from the cold, my sister wild rose.By men who wear their spats right?.Got matches?.Now she's a big teaser, she took me half the way there..Torn, in two, torn away..I know some of us were born to cast our fortunes to the winds   And I guess I'm bound to travel down a road that never ends   But I know I'll never look upon the likes of her again   And I'll never understand why I lost her      [Chorus:]   'cause she brightened up the day like the early morning sun   And she made what I was doin' seem worth while   It's the closest thing to living that I guess I've ever known   And it made me want to smile, when I loved her..Beautiful miracle, pardon my lyrical rhapsody,   Can't you see?.Let me take my scarf off,   No, no, no, yes, yes, yes..Does everybody want to?.Talkin' bout my generation..I don't care about you      I've seen an old man have a heart attack in Manhattan   Well he died while we just stood there lookin' at him   Ain't he cute?.Passing through the storm -

"Author Katherine Paterson proclaims, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf - that work i abhor - then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' A controversial issue in today's society are people's conflicting views on censorship in libraries. Many types of books, magazines, music, movies, and much more have been banned from being put on the shelves of libraries because of their content. From personal experience, observations, and reading of the issue censorship should not be allowed in libraries.     The shelves of libraries will soon be empty if censorship continues. Certain readings, and types of entertainment have already begun to disappear one by one. It is understandable if one person does not agree with the material being placed into these books, but why should they ruin the entertainment for everyone else? From my own experience, people in my elementary school were not able to enjoy reading a popular series of books at that time period. Since I went to a @CAPS1 school, the priest at the corresponding church during that time decided he did not agree with the content in this certain series of books. As a result, he took charge and made the staff of the school remove those books from our school library, and no student was allowed to come to school with one of those types of books. If it had been up to him, he would have decided to go ahead and take out all those books from everywhere in the world. Just because one individual does not agree on the content of that book, they should not be able to have the power to banish the lovely leisure for the rest of the population.     Authors and artists of books, movies, and music have the freedom to put into them whatever they choose. It should not be up to their audience to decide whether or not it is appropriate. The concept is quite simple; if the reader or viewer does not think they would agree with the work, then they should not spend their time to read or view the pieces at hand. Just because they might not completely think what the content entails is necessarily appropriate, someone else might enjoy it. Censorship is wrong for this very reason. The creators of their work are most likely proud of what they have accomplished and would like their audience to enjoy it to. The audience they are trying to appeal to @MONTH1 not have the same taste in style as someone who the work was not necessarily meant to have their own opinion on the matter. Books should not be able to be taken out of libraries because what one person might think is not appropriate to be placed into public, another person @MONTH1 enjoy thouroughly. Likewise, if the content of a work of literature does not appeal to an individual then it should just simply not be read by that person. As humans, there is the freedom of choice as to what people would like to read, and what they would not like to indulge in. So make the correct choice in deciding what you want to read, and do not ruin the enjoyment for many others.     In a great deal of different types of literature censorship is touched on by the authors. For example, in the popular prize-winning novel, @CAPS2 @NUM1, books are burned, or 'censored' because they contain information people should not be aware of in that period of time. However, in today's world books are a major type of entertainment and are important in the knowledge of everyone. Books provide so much information on almost every subject known to human-kind that it would be such a dramatic loss if now books were burned if caught reading one. Paterson does point out that everyone has a right to their own opinion of this matter, but if people do not take the right approach to solving this situation, there will be no books left on library shelves for several generations after to enjoy for themselves. Every individual has their own right to be able to read books and absorb all the wonders and knowledge they contain.     As a result of the growing awareness of censorship in today's libraries, people @MONTH1 never be able to enjoy certain types of books, movies, music, and magazines. From my own past experiences on this situation I know how wrong it is to take away someone's own privelage to enjoy types of literature. People should not have a say whether something is appropriate or not to be taken out of libraries. If the individual does not simply agree with the specific content of the work then they need to accept it and move on instead of causing millions of others to not enjoy it. Also, from different types of reading, censorship has definitely become a serious issue, but it should be abolished. Keep the books that are on library shelves now for many generations to come and enjoy for themselves.Bom bom bom bom bom bom bom bom bom   Bom bom bom I love you..Yeah, I'm such a liar   One time I

"Libraries hold many books and movies such as fiction, nonfiction, historical, fantasy, and adventure.  These books have many different styles and portrails and many of these @MONTH1 be takeno offensive but that doesn't mean that they can just be taken off the shelf.     One book that comes to my mind that can be seen as offensive is 'The @CAPS1 of @ORGANIZATION2'.  This book talks about blacks as slaves and how they should be whipped for being let go and it call them @ORGANIZATION1 offensive names yet it is a classic and is in almost every book store or library in the country. Why, because it was written back when slavery was legl and slaves were treated as property not people.    A movie that many people have seen recently is slumdog @CAPS4.  This movie has a boy from a slum being tortured because he knows the answers to the questions on the gameshow '@CAPS2 @CAPS3 to be a @CAPS4?'.  Many indians @CAPS2 are smarter could be offended by this because they are saying if you grow up in a slum you can't be smart.  But, people blow it off because it is a movie so it isn't real.       But if you go to somepeople and ask them about these books are movies some will say they are @ORGANIZATION1 good others might be offended so they might as weel stay on the shelfs.  The book '@CAPS5 @CAPS6' is a book about the civil war could this be scene as offensive showing the thoughts of both sides saying slavery is good and bad at the same time yet it is another classic and will stay on the book shelfs.     So books in libraries shouldn't be censroed because of being offensive to a race, sex, or group; they should stay on the shelf because every books other tahn some childrens books have something offensive.  Thus if we took books off the shelfs for being offensive their would be nothing to read except for 'The @ORGANIZATION1'!.Don't be shy you learn to fly   And see the sun when day is done   If only you see   Just what you are beneath a star   That came to stay one rainy day   In autumn for free   Yes, be what you'll be..We come into the world and take our chances   Fate is just the weight of circumstances   That's the way that lady luck dances   Roll the bones      Jack, relax..Faithful friends who are dear to us   Gather near to us once more..Well, when I walk, when I walk   Walk my horse upon a hill   Well, when I walk, walk, walk, walk   Walk my horse upon a hill   When I lay me down   Will my lover love me still?.Bet you want a piece of me   Do you like what you see?.[Chorus:]      Yeah!.They are not what they claim to be..Fine man, I'm going on the road, do you know anyone who   could house sit for me?.Are you a cat or a dog person?.First you take of your hat   Then you take of those brand new shoes   Say 'Hey George, what've you got to lose?'.How can I trust my eyes, do they really see   What is the truth?.When they get hot they gonna blow,   You see them winnin' every show..Nothing is planned, by the sea and the sand.See the joy and heartbreak,   For all the world to see..Do Do Do Do   Do Do Do Do Do   Do Do Do Do.Well, what's your happiness, gerard?.But I don't like trouble, and when trouble starts,   It's the times I wish I could forget her..I climb the mountain top, I saw the bottom drop..She knows that I'm not afraid   To look at her..I need a shower, take a nap   I'll meet you in the bar, we must have a rap..Let's talk more plain, let's move, embrace   Let your heart get away, oh yeah!.If anyone could find the joy..."
"In my opinion,  I do not believe that anyone has a choice in what children or any other age group chooses to read. It is not up to the general public to say what is right or wrong. When society says that every single child is not allowed to read a certain book, or listen to a certain song just because it is found offensive to some people. There are laws against restricting what a person can or can not view. There is a level of media that is not as appropriate as it should be but that does not mean it has to go away completely. Some of the reasons society can not sensor everything are because of the fact that not everone is offended by everything, it is up to the parent of the child to say what is right or wrong, and lastly individuality is comprimised if the choices we have are limited.      When someone gets offeneded by the media that is out there, that does not neccessarily mean that another person is also offended. When I do not like a video, or a book, or any other type of content, someone else should not have that content censorded because my opinion is in the way of what they enjoy. I know that personally I would not want someone to take away my favorite book so my child could not read it. Content that is out in the public will always be unsafe to read by someone else's views. Just like I will not believe in what other people believe in, but, I will see that it is valued by others and should not remain a censored topic.          Books that are considered inappropriate, should be decided to has censoreship by the parents of a young child. Decisions like that should not be left up to a group of people that has opposite views. Whe children are growing up and are taught the values that know today, it is their parents that teach them and not a society full of people which have different kinds of opinions. There is a saying by an author and it says 'all of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf' and all that means if we all would have the power to remove a book or any other content from the shelf that we do not like then their would not be any books left. I believ in that saying and I also believe that many others will as well.      Individualaity is when one person has differnt traits of feelings than another human being. We all have choices of the books we read and the musice we listen to and that is why we all have individuality. When people start to thnk that they are allowed to remove a certain song or book because that is not what they want other people to see, then everyone will do the same and no one would have that song they enjoy or the traits that make them differnt because they are the only one that likes that song. If there were not any of us left on this earth that has something that they enjoyed and no one else that also enjoyed the same thing, then we would all be pretty boring. I have learned from experience that being the person that has something different about them is not a bad thing and is actually a good thing in some cases.      Also from experience I have learned that a boom that is no longer on the shelf that someone has removed is not a good feeling. I would not want the same happen to all of the other books in the world. It is a very good thing to practice the art of understading, and to have an open mind when it comes to a certain material that another person happens to enjoy. In the future, when I find a book that @MONTH1 not be a book I would want my children to read, I will just let the topic go and remember that everyone has their own opinions. So in conclusion I just want to let everyone know that books that are seen as inappropriate or offensive to one person, @MONTH1 be seen as a good thing to another..And I wonder what shes thinking      [Chorus]   She don't Mah Jong, Mah Jong she don't play..Each sonnet is more ridiculous   Than the last..Could this be the land of the free?.To?.Here I am   In this broken town   Missing you   Wishing you were still around      Streets are full of people, happy   Heading on their way   Why am I the only one   Who's COLD on such a pretty day?.Cast my memory back there, Lord, sometimes I'm overcome thinking 'bout   Rolling in the green grass, behind the stadium with you...

"In society today, people take things in very many different ways. So things that might help one person, @MONTH1 offend other.      In libraries, there are different kinds of books; fiction, non fiction..(etc). So if you dont like a particular book, maybe you should try looking in a different area. I do not think books should be removed from the shelf because the book has offened a few people.      We are blessed to live in @LOCATION1, where we have freedom of speech. So authors have freedom to write what they would like to. They work long hard hours getting a book ready to be published and then someone wants to take it off the shelf becasue it offened a few people? I do not think that is right.     '@CAPS1 man's junk is another man's treasure.' I think this quote goes along with this topic very well, because the book @MONTH1 not mean something to one person but it @MONTH1 mean the word to someone else.      You never know what people @MONTH1 need to hear. Maybe an alcoholic is at a point in his/her life and is ready to change, and someone has a book about a recovering alcoholic. Now, this kind of book @MONTH1 offend a few people, but it @MONTH1 save a family, a friendship or maybe even a life.      Take @CAPS2 @CAPS3 for intance, her journal is now a book. Now this @MONTH1 offend a few people that might have been thereor maybe don't like @CAPS4 @CAPS5, but her story has the right to be told. Yes, there is violence in it, and i understand that maybe you don't want your @NUM1 year old to hear about how they use to treat @CAPS4 @CAPS7 women, but the story has the right to be told, and should be told.      I do not think that the librarian has the right to take a book off the shelf at the library, just because it has offened a few. There are lots of different kinds of books, if the books you are reading offend you, look for a different type of book.Dodger   Consider yourself      All   At home..[Big Boi]   Well here's a formal introduction   Something to make you ponder   The situation's ugly, like ""In Living Color""'s Wanda (word up!).Oh the morning glory!.A sickness coming over me   Like watching freedom being sucked straight out to sea   And the solution?.Christmas,   The church bells in town   Are ringing of snow,   What a happy sound,   Baby please come home..Everybody, pray enough to take a stand,   I knocked on every door, on every dead end street,   Looking for forgiveness,   What's left to believe?.I will be free today..Oh, oh.Now pay witness to Sonny's burning   Warming the damp and rotten seed   Warming the damp and rotten seed   That blooms into the DEMON FLOWER   Now both fire and flowers consume me..We are radiating at last..But all along the rockies you can feel it in the air   From telluride to boulder down below   The closest thing to heaven on this planet anywhere   Is a quiet christmas morning in the colorado snow      I remember christmases when I was just a boy   In the morning I would run to see the tree..Things they do will all go c-c-cold...talkin' 'bout my generation...

"Practice @CAPS1 You @CAPS2     The @LOCATION1 is considered one of the greatest countries in the world because it is a free country. In the @DATE1's people migrated here to escape the control that their government had in their homeland. In @LOCATION2 we practice freedom of speech. If we censor materials like books, music, movies, etc. it would defeat the entire purpose of @LOCATION2 and it's @ORGANIZATION1.     Everyone has their own personality with likes and dislikes. Not everyone likes the same music or is interested in reading the same subject, thats why its wonderful that their is a variety of everything. If you start banning or censoring certain things then how will people learn? There is nothing wrong with learning about negative things because that teaches people lessons so they know @CAPS1 or @CAPS1 not to do if in that situation. When you censor 'bad things' it creates naive thinkers, which only leads to discrimination.      I agree that for children there should warnings for material that parents @MONTH1 find offensive. For example, movies have ratings for different age groups, and books could do the same. Of course its up to the parents if they want to follow the recommendations but banning something all together is not neccessary.     I personally learned a lot of things from @CAPS1 I've seen on television. Whats on television @MONTH1 be considered 'street smart' education but that is good. Today we live in a scary and violent society, so being 'street smart' is an advantage. If television was censored then people would not know @CAPS1 to do in a bad situation because they have never experienced or seen of it before.     If books, movies, magazines, music, etc. are removed from shelves then @LOCATION2 is not practicing @CAPS1 it preaches to the many of people who come here in search of freedom..Cause I'm still breathing   Cause I'm still breathing on my own   My head's above the rain and roses   Making my way, my way   My way to you.Those little lanes, they have not changed,   A sweet peace fills the air..Making two possibilities a reality,   Predicting the future of things we all know,   Fighting off the diseased programming   Of centuries, centuries, centuries, centuries      Science fails to recognize the single most   Potent element of human existence   Letting the reigns go to the unfolding   Is faith, faith, faith, faith      Science has failed our world   Science has failed our Mother Earth      Science fails to recognize the single most   Potent element of human existence   Letting the reigns go to the unfolding   Is faith, faith, faith, faith      Science has failed our world   Science has failed our Mother Earth..In the name of love   Before you break my heart   Stop!.Thank God it ain't about me anymore!.He said ""Before I met her, I didn't love nothin..Esther used to be the kind of lover you would   Never leave   She'd do anything to give me what I need for my   Disease   She would do anything.Yeah      Can you hear the music?.I can tell you my love for you will still be strong   After the boys of summer have gone..Joey, Joey,   What made them want to come and blow you away?.Yeah, I've been around,   And the best two friends I've ever found   Are a woman's love and a guitar sound..Forever forever your lamp will burn   Forever home forever would that you'd learn   That you came with nothing   So with nothing you'll return      Home   You know you're not alone   It's only 'cause you're not a home   That you feel so out of place..Oh, I'll be so good to ya babe, yeah!.It's not I, but it's you that liveth in me..Oh you've got to watch out   When you wander round the square in the morning   Cos they're everywhere, they're everywhere      Here we have an honest man   A civil servant to boot   He lived high up in the Ministry   And when he wished to make a point   He knew just what to do   His window ledges were all covered in grease   ""I want them out of here""      He said to me, ""I want them gone""   Because you see - Oh don't you see   None of us are getting any younger   You've got to follow your nose   And if it tells you that you've got to go   Well that's because, they're everywhere,   They're everywhere      So we called in those men, those horrible men   We set them to work on the rooftops   You see their van is very plain   And I know they're too ashamed   To wear their by appointment badges anymore   Sometimes they use vaseline, sometimes they use the pill   I've often seen them with a gun   But as the years go by, old habits seem to die   And nowadays they knockatize them all   Oh you've got to watch out   As you wander round the square in the morning   Oh they're everywhere, they're everywhere.And it all feels so right!.I'm a soldier true and true, I know I make it true the storm....Don't wanna be torn!.Beauty queens fall in trances,   Debutantes lose their furs..Are you gonna stand around till 2012 A.D.?.Shut your mouth 'cause you're talking too much   And I don't give a damn anyway   You always seem to be stepping in shit   And all you really do is complain   Hitch a ride, tell 'em all you like   Small minds tend to think a like      Shut your mouth 'cause you're talking too much   And I don't give a fuck anyway      Let yourself go, let yourself go, let yourself go   Let yourself go, let yourself go, let yourself go   Let yourself go, let yourself go, let yourself go   Let yourself go, let yourself go, let yourself go   Gotta let me go, gotta let it go   Gotta let me go, gotta let it go      Cut the crap 'cause you're screaming in my ear   And you're taking up all of the space   You're really testing my patience again   And I'd rather get punched in the face   You're getting on my every last nerve   Everything you've said I've already heard      I'm sick to death of your every last breath   And I don't give a fuck anyway      Let yourself go, let yourself go, let yourself go   Let yourself go, let yourself go, let yourself go   Let yourself go, let yourself go, let yourself go   Let yourself go, let yourself go, let yourself go   Gotta let me go, gotta let it go   Gotta let me go, gotta let it go   Gotta let me go, gotta let it go   Gotta let me go, gotta let it go      Always fuck fuckin' with my head now   Always fuck fuckin' with my head now   Always fuck fuckin' with my head now   Always fucking with my head and I gotta let it go!.Play me online?"
"Many people have many different thoughts and beliefs. Some people @MONTH1 believe that a movie or song needs to be removed, but others @MONTH1 disagree, and nobody wants the things they enjoy to be taken away.     If there was a book on a shelf in a bookstore that you didn't agree with and thought should be removed, and you removed it, then you are taking away from someone who @MONTH1 enjoy that book. If everyone removed things from life that they didn't enjoy, then there would be very little to enjoy.    For example, I personally love horror movies. I love the thrill you get from a horror movie and how they can make you jump even though it's just a movie screen. I'm sure there are people in this world who think horror movies are wrong. If those people were allowed to just remove them forever, I, and many other people, would be sadly dissapointed. I also love video games. Video games are a huge part of my life, and I know for a fact that there are people who highly disagree with some of the content of them. If people could take video games away because they didn't agree with them, i would be crushed.     I am also aware that people @MONTH1 just be worried about their children watching movies, listening to songs, or reading books that are not appropriate for them. I understand that the parents want their children to be supervised, but removing the books, movies and songs is not exactly the answer. Movies and books can easily be censored. Many movies and songs have language filters and some movie programs now have parental options that allow the parents to decide what movies they want to allow their children to watch. Parents can also supervise their children when they download music onto an ipod or phone, and depending on where they are bought, books and magazine's @MONTH1 require parental consent. Video games also require parental consent depending on the rating of the game.      We can't just go around removing everything we dont like, because it is not fair to those who @MONTH1 like it. We live in a world with many different ideas, thoughts and beliefs, and we all need equal right to share them.Old brown clock ticking on my shelf   Take my mind to someplace else   Little gold clock ticking by my bed   Funny little people dancing 'round my head      Morning brings me things to do   Morning brings me thoughts of you   Gentle sunshine through the curtain lace   Some of which shining on your sweet face      Counting hours making days   Watching time throwing love away   Nothing golden never stays   That's what I heard the poets say Mmm ...

"I dont think books that would affend people should be on the shelf. some of the books that maybe on the shelf @MONTH1 hurt some ones feelings. But i also think people should beable to read what they want to read. many people wouldnt read a book that they think would affend them.      There are many kinds of books not all book will be bad or affend people. but books that are not apropriot for young kids or teens shouldnt even be in school librarys. In public librarys i think it should be ok to have every type of book. and have different books in different place's. like haveing the young adalt section and the adalt and children section.     I think screton books should be sold in book stores like i dont think they should have inapropeiout books in children book store's. They should have a different store for certain books. And parents should monitor what there children are reading and take part in the book by helping them understand what the book is saying.      There are lots of parents that dont really care about what there kids read, and to me that's there busness but my apenioun is that they shouldn't let there kids read what they want. Parents should be with the child when he/she is picking out a book. But if it is a teen @DATE1 and older, i think they would be old enough to choise what they want to read. by the time they are that age they have matured enough to read and understand things much easer.Oh, I was moved by your screen dream   Celluloid pictures living   Your death could not kill my love for you   Take two people romantic   Smoky nightclub situation   Your cigarette traces a

"Everyone person can think of something that we did not like or want to see. If you were offended by that one thing, do you think you should have the right to have it taken away or banned? Or what if you liked the choice of what the place had, but someone else didn't? Should they have the right to take it away just because they don't approve?                                            What if @NUM1 people came into a library with  @NUM2 books, magazines, music and movies, and @NUM3 of them did not like any part of the library and wanted every book, magazine, music, and movie taken out? Even if the @NUM4 others loved what they saw? Do you think it's fair just because some people do not approve, that they get to pick? I do not think it would be fair for just one person to be able to have the right to do that. If something is that offensive to that many people, they should be mature enough to ignore what they see and find what they like.                                                                 If someone did not like your house and said I don't want to see it should they have to demolish it just like nothing?                The world would have never ending chaos if people had too much power to change things. It could only get worse.              I have encountered problems between people that do not agree on throwing out or keeping it. One solution could be just move it to a different area where if certain people would like to look at the item they could, otherwise have  separate parts of a room that are divided into all ranges.                                       If you read this and think to yourself about how many different options you have to get along and not have to worry about offending people you will realize that no certain person should be able to take that one thing that you would like to keep to enjoy and be happy..All of my friends come to see me last night   I was laying in my bed and dying   Annie Beauneu from Saint Angel   Say ""the weather down here so fine""      Just then the wind   Came squalling through the door   But who can   The weather command?.(Freestyle)   Bakit ngayon ka lang   Bakit ngayon kung kelan ang aking puso'y meron nang laman      (Pops)   Sana'y nalaman ko na darating ka sa buhay ko   Di sana'y naghintay ako...

"Do i think that if books, movies, music, magazines, etc should be removed from the shelves just becuase they are offensive? No, i don't think that the stuff should be removed from the shelves just becuase someone thinks or takes it to be offensive. Let's say this ok if we had everybody go and say that this book is offensive, or I don't think this movie should be on this shelve because i think it's offensive or this or that then we wouldn't have anything to wacht, lissin to, or even read. I under stand that yes people do have rights and there believes on something but it doesn't mean that they have any say so on what should stay or what should go.           If we let people do this than nobody would be abel to wacht, read, play,  or even lissin to for fun. Us people used these thing for haveing something to keep us intertaned. Let's say this ok we all know how littel children have thier emanginashon and they used that to keep them intertaned just like us older people used books, music, movies, and ect to keep us intertand. Well if we don't have this stuff than we would be lost and won't know what to do with out that stuff. Just's think of our littel kids if we take there emanginashon away than they would be lost and hoples because that's how they learn and grow up.     We people used this every day use to not onley keep us intertaned but to also help us learn more about what every we need to learn about to survive in every day life. See in ways we are not so diffrent from our chiledren at all realy. they used what every they find or see to keep them intertaned and for enjoiment. If people realy thought about what they are realy going to do by removing something from the shelves than they would regreat that what they did was stupied because now they don't have anything to read, lissin to, or even wacht. I my own self had experience on what it's like to have something like that polled down from the shelves befor and it's realy not cool at all fore that to happen. Takeing something off the shelfs that is alittel bit offensive doesn't meen that it should be tooken off the shelves.     I think that if people who took something off the shelves just becase one person thought that it was offensive if wrong and should not take somthing down that maby other people like. I mean just look at what the thing is talking about first and see if it's offensive to you or not and maybe it's something that people could learn from.

"Offensive or @CAPS1?     Who can truely say a book, movie, music, or magazine is truely offensive. There are some of the obvious movies that completely make fun of or taunt someone's personal views as a religion or lifestyle but is a book about a wizarding world really that offensive?     While growing up I had a friend who was very religious. Her parents would never let her read the @ORGANIZATION1 books by @PERSON1. At the time I didn't understand why she wasn't able to read such fantastic books. Now that I'm older I understand that her parents believe what is in 'The @CAPS2' and nothing more. Make believe and imagination was @CAPS1 a suitable thing fpr their child to read. For many families, though the @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 series is nothing but a different world in which they can set themselves free from the real world. Should a book that many people love and adore be taken off shelves because some families are offended? I personally don't think they should.      While my family loves the books and movies some families don't. That is their lifestyle and their opinion. Everyone has an opinion, and if we took out everything in this world that could offend someone we would be left with nothing. Movies would be boring, stories would @CAPS1 be interesting, and there would be no music.      If our world was based off of the opinions of others and making everyone happy we would @CAPS1 have music. Music is a way for someone to release their soul. The different sounds of music are based off generations. My mother's generation was based on @CAPS3 @CAPS4' @CAPS5 and mine is of @CAPS6, @CAPS7&@CAPS8, @CAPS9. So what would really happen if all the offensive materials were taken off the shelves of a public library or say a @ORGANIZATION2. The shelves would be blank. Empty shelves would be a horrible look.      Everyone is offended by something. I'm offended by the rape scences in movies but some people believe in some situations it makes a movie better. My friend's family is offended by the make believe world of @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1, and I believe that some where out in our world there is another world, a wizarding world as a matter of fact.      People believe in many different things and like many different things. I've never met one person who is exactly like me, because there is @CAPS1 one. I'm an individual like everyone else and if the things I liked were taken off a shelf because someone was offended then my life would be boring because I wouldn't have the things I enjoy. In some cases some offensive things should be taken off shelves but who am I to say it should be, because there is someone out there who believes it should be on the shelves of @LOCATION1.Wake up!.I see how but to blind to see why..What a pearl!.....My name is Donald White, you see,   I stand before you all..Cette nuit      Glory Glory Alleluia   Glory Glory Alleluia   Glory Glory Alleluia   Chantons chantons No?.Happy birthday, Jesus, it's that time of year   All the lights on the trees say Christmas time is near   Another year's behind us, you helped us make it through   So, happy birthday, Jesus, this song is just for you      We all get so hung up on material things at times it seems like we forget   What Christmas really means   It should be thanks we're givin', that's why I wrote this tune   Happy birthday, Jesus, this sing is just for you      There's a gift for everyone but you underneath the tree   No, it's not much, but I hope you like this song to you from me      Happy birthday Jesus, that's why I wrote this tune   So, happy birthday, Jesus, my song is just for you.should've been over for me   No angel came..Gypsy rains wash all the planes   [?].No it doesn't leave much for imagination,   But it shows off your assets   I can fix us a drink, while you slip into these things..Live with me forever now,   Pull the blackout curtains down,   Just not for long, for long..Woke up this morning, jumped out of bed,   Hit my head on a lampshade and the clock said   That I'm running late so I'm rushing trying to get on my way   (huuuh)get to my car and the gauge is on E,   Get gas and I pay a dollar ninety-three   Got stopped by the cops cause I was speeding   Eighty-nine in a fifty-five Lord, why me      On a day like today,   All has gone wrong and my life seems crazy   Gotta hold on, smile on my face   Cause I know the sun's gonna shine my way   On a day like today,   Look up at the sky and know life's so amazing   And I know I will be okay   Cause I know the sun's gonna shine my way      It's days like this there's a lesson learned   When I get up on the wrong side of the world   It's easy to dwell on my situation instead of every good thing   (but I know I've been blessed) I gotta say thank you   (and though there's stress) I'm still grateful   (it's just a test) he's more than able to see me through on a day      On a day like today,   All has gone wrong and my life seems crazy   Gotta hold on, smile on my face   Cause I know the sun's gonna shine my way   On a day like today,   Look up at the sky and know life's so amazing   And I know I will be okay   Cause I know the sun's gonna shine my way      I know it wouldn't hurt to smile   It's not as bad as it could be it will work out in a while (repeat)      On a day like today,   All has gone wrong and my life seems crazy   Gotta hold on, smile on my face   Cause I know the sun's gonna shine my way   On a day like today,   Look up at the sky and know life's so amazing   And I know I will be okay   Cause I know the sun's gonna shine my way      So I just h.It's how we do it, our heads in our hands..Sometimes I think that I know   What love's all about   And when I see the light   I know I'll be all right..I know you think you deserve an explanation on the meanings of life..Got those swollen hand blues..And me, I'll repay the favor with your favorite thing you love to do..My mama said she can't understand me   She can't see my motivation   Just give me some security,   I'm a paranoid schizoid product of the twentieth century..And what about the boy that this story's about?.Send that wire to us   I make them change their name to Diddy, retire the puff   I'm getting acting money   You niggas is Kevin Hart, y'all be acting funny   I'mma a keep a linebacker, tell 'em tackle for me   Yo, you seen my last pic, go double-tap that for me   Cock back, Red octagon, stop that      [Hook].Sunny, thank you for the truth you let me see..My sweet everything   Hey God, I really don't know who I am."
"As said before there would be no books for anyone to read if everybody removed what they felt was offensive. The libraries would have a very watered down material base and there would be no reason to use this place anymore. Some material is not suitable for young ages there is much from advanced material that can be learned; thus the libraries should sperate their books only as they do already.     Some material does seem to advanced for others but these materials are needed to advance academic gwroth. Some people should think that school should not read @PERSON1 due to racism in the south. This was true history so there should be no restrictions to that sort of book. If there were those soprt of restrictions then schools would lack much of histories best literature.     Just as the movies do for the gerneal population, @CAPS1 is for @NUM1 and up while @NUM2 is for @NUM3 and up. These are good standard that keep the youth from seeing what they are not yet ready for. This concept should be used the same way in these libraries where there seems to be a problem.Yet this is already done in libraries. There would be no reason to break these sectiopns up more then they already are broken. There is the young adult section, adult, and youth. Those are the main catagories that most perople want sperate due to offensivce material such as drugs, sex, and alchohol.     Much of the media that is public today is censered and that benefits much of the youth, but there is a point where the public needs to realize that sheltering the outh can stunt them academically.Thanks anyways""      Turkey for me   Turkey for you   Let's eat the turkey   In my big brown shoe   Love to eat the turkey   At the table   I once saw a movie   With Betty Grable   Eat that turkey   All night long   Fifty million Elvis fans   Can't be wrong   Turkey lurkey doo and   Turkey lurkey dap   I eat that turkey   Then I take a nap      Thanksgiving is a special night   Jimmy Walker used to say Dynomite   That's right   Turkey with gravy and cranberry   Can't believe the Mets traded Darryl Strawberry   Turkey for you and   Turkey for me   Can't believe Tyson   Gave that girl V.D..(No cigar!).Whoa, whoa, I'm radioactive, radioactive..'Cause see, we could go get it crackin, but you know what'll happen,   We be under the covers, makin' love to each other   I got a double bed, one's to sleep on   The other one's to get my freak on, it's all for the (ladies)   Yeah I ball for the (ladies) Hit the mall for the (ladies)   Keep it fly for the (ladies) Keep my eye on the (ladies)   Hot tub for the (ladies) pop bub' for the (ladies)   I got love for my (ladies)      [Chorus]      We gon' Chi-town step it out, 'til the club lettin' out   Then we gon' sex it out, 'til we all checking out   I got my chicks I'ma bring to the telly   We 'bout to do the damn thing, sing to 'em Kelly..Who's got the brain of JFK?.The bastard won't even eat nothing he's fed   He just hung himself in the bedroom he's dead""   ""Debbie don't let that fucker get you upset   Go in there, stick a fuckin' cigarette to his neck   I bet you he's fakin' it, I bet you   I bet he probably just want's to see how upset you would get   I'll go handle this of course, unless you object""   ""Ahh go fuck his brains out, if any's left in his head""      [Chorus]   If you could count the skeletons in my closet   Under my bed and up under my faucet   Then you would know I've completely lost it   Is he nuts?.Cute..Shirley was a lady whose teeth were made of gold   She danced before the music and everything it told      Huckleberry Grove   Where the music plays into tomorrow night   Huckleberry Grove   Only fools would need to argue or to fight      Shirley had eight children and each of them were told   You got joy for singing burning in your soul      Huckleberry Grove   Where the idiots can't ease you of your mind   Huckleberry Grove   Take a free train, leave your luggage far behind      Oh she sings shangri-la   Oh she sings shangri-la      Shirley was a lady who mostly stayed at home   But she went out dancing down Huckleberry Grove      Huckleberry Grove   Where the music plays into tomorrow night   Huckleberry Grove   You'll be groovin' on the best days of your life   Huckleberry Grove   Where the music's guaranteed to blow your mind   Huckleberry Grove   Leave your luggage, get a free train, get behind      Oh she sings shangri-la   Oh she sings shangri-la.It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas   Ev'rywhere you go,   Take a look in the five-and-ten, it's glistening once again   With candy canes and silver lanes that glow..How come we can't talk the way we used to do?.It's so long since I sang songs to you   I forget all the words I once knew   I could look back   But I can't waste the time      Did it matter   They sometimes didn't rhyme   It's so long since I sang songs for you      It's so long since you smile just for me   Now your smile's just an old use to be   Does it matter   That I can take the time      Would you rather   I write you one more line   Can my songs once again be for you      Claudie made a fool out of me   Made me find another place to be   I've been living alone   In a house that wasn't my home   With Claudie is the place I want to be      When I left did you think of me crying   Did you care that I felt I was dying   I pretended   That I don't give a damn   All along   I've know what I really am   I'm a fool little Claudie just for you      Claudie made a fool out of me   Made me find another place to be   I've been living alone   In a house that wasn't my home   With Claudie is the place I want to be.Our love is like a new car smell   Sooner or later it all goes to hell   Somebody farts or spills some taco bell   Our love is like a new car smell   Our love is like a barbeque ignition   You know that button you push lights the propane emission   It works for a month then the spark goes missing   Our love is like a barbeque ignition   Our love is like a video game   That you play alot and then it gets lame   Then a new one comes out that's better but the same   Our love is like a video game   Our love..

"Some people think that offensive books should be off the selves, but some other people think that this should not be allowed.     I do not believe that certain materials (books, movies, and magazines.  If we take evey book off the self then we would not have any book to read.  If we start taking offensive books off the self then every body coming in would be taking @NUM1 books off the self.  Then with in two days there would be not books left.     If we do not have any books then are eyes would be bad. We should not take books off the selves because of some people like to read.  If people do not like the books in the library then they should not go to the library to get books.     This is why people should not take offensice books off the selves.

"Imagine your child or someone that is very close to you. He's only around @NUM1 old just starting to learn how to be an adult and take on responibliltys. He wants to try new things. He listeans to his friends talking about drinking alchol and how much fun is it. He thinks it sounds amazing to drink. He dosnt no something is bad about it or not. No one every told him. So he starts to drink an dlater died of alchol posing. Now, you dont want this to ever happen to someone who is very close to you. If people are to scared to talk about the bad things in life. Like sex, drugs, etc..Then they should make books and movies to show how bad these thing are. There should not be censorship in libraries. Some of you @MONTH1 say 'well there to young they cant hanndle these things yet.' @CAPS1 your opinon you should think of there maturity level, aslo they can learn from other peoples mistakes, and it would educate people.     How do you tell on someones maturity level? There are many ways to tell. If you talk to someone about sex and they start to laugh and make jokes then there not very mature. But, you cant asociate that every @NUM2 year old is immature. Many people @MONTH1 take this as a serious thing. Others @MONTH1 not but, they still will be able to see them in there own way. Putting censorship in libraries would not be a good idea.     Many topics in books, movies, music, magazines, etc.. @MONTH1 have inapropte things in them. Like sex, drugs, drinking, bad language. Should all these things be taken out on libraires and off the shevles? @CAPS1 a hard question to answer. But, what you can answer from that is it would allow people to learn from there mistakes. If theres a movie and a guy and he is doing drugs and later dies. People could assume that drugs kill you. But, what about the other thing? Its hard to show how its bad to say an offensive word to someone, that they herd on the radio. But, when they here that word or read about something or watch. They can ask about it and we can say that saing those things or doing them can be offensive.      Now, can you educate someone from letting the person listean, read , or watch about something offensive or etc..? It depends on the person. But, you can educate someone about the subject matter. No matter how offensive the topic is. We should teach people about them. If we dont, its bound to repeat it self. Say if we censor the holocaust becuase of how horifying it was. No one would no about it and we would most likely repeat the holocaust. Censoring certain things a library would not be that good of an idea.      Ceratin people can hanndle talking about certain subjects. Its not always a good thing to censor offensive subjects. We need to teach people about these thing to educate them, and also so they can learn on what has been done and not repeat it, also some people can handle these materials, they just need to have a high maturitly level. These are some reasons why there should not be censorship in libraries and other places.Yes, I did, yes, I did   Somebody please tell him who the eff I is   I am Nicki Minaj, I mack them dudes up

"Offensive books do belong in the library, just in a completely different area, away from the children. If we all chose a book that we didn't want in the library, there would be none left. So, since everyone has a different opinion about what is offensvie and what isn't, who's to say what can and can't be in the library?     When I was little, my grandma would take me to the library almost every @DATE1. I noticed that she tried to keep me from getting certain books and was fine with others. My @CAPS1 did the same thing, but they had different opinions on what was okay for me to read and what wasn't. Grandma wanted me to get religious books and @CAPS1 was okay with that and things like '@CAPS2 the @CAPS3 @CAPS4 @CAPS5', and '@PERSON1'.      Even at home, everyone's opinion is very different. For instance, when it comes to music at my house; @CAPS1 likes country, @CAPS7 likes metal, my brother likes alternative, my unlcle likes rock, and I like a combonation of all of it.      That just does to show how different people have different opinions; some more strict than others. If we relied on peoples' opinions to keep our librarys free of offense, there would be nothing in it.Back in the days I made up my mind   That I would be a king, you know, genuine   Reign supreme at the top of the heap   And like working all day, no time to sleep   Destined to rise, in front of your eyes   So we surmise, it's time for the prize   The time has come, we gotta be number one   The world is full of power and we got to get some   No more beggin' and useless teardrops   So I'm trading these teardrops for props   Goin' all the way and with my powerful team   Conquering the world and I'ma rise like cream   All out, putting heads to bed   'Cause I'm a grown man and I hate to get spoon-fed   Wisdom, son, I rose in the east   Till we reach the top, won't be no peace, 'cause it's      [Chorus:]   Strictly business, strictly business   Ain't no way I'm gonna stop   Strictly business, ain't no time to get more   Gotta make it to the top      Everything we do, gotta be brand new   The moves we make, gotta make the earth shake   Sitting at my desk, 'cause I manifest to my team   Big plans that'll make us the best   'Cause we can rule this game we all play   Pop champagne and make everyday a holiday   Smooth as a rose but hard like steel   From now on, I'ma make my dreams real   On a mission, gotta get there   If you want to rule, you gotta be in there   Our masterplan is the best   And ain't a man alive that'll beat us to a conquest   'Cause this is the reason we was born   To rock on and on and on and on   Look at my eyes, it's hypnotizing   Word is bond, we gotta keep on rising      [Chorus:]      I'ma be a legend in all the books and mags   Stuffin' the cash inside garbage bags   Ain't no time to waste, we gotta motivate   Pass anybody that stops to get gas   Forever and a day, my destiny's set   No sweat, I make it rougher than rougher gets   Hold on tight, if not, get blown away   Pick up the pieces 'cause we're known to say   Radical things to get a champion's ring   Give it up, punk, don't make me swing   We planned ahead to get the butter and the bread   Dressed in black and I'm stayin' out the red   So when it comes to like taking charge   Get props for where they do and stop frontin' on tar   Gotta go for what you know to be the cream of the crop   With the power of God, I'ma rise to the top, it's      [Chorus:]      Uncle L (uhh!).My

yours cannot be mine   And I'm bored by dreams..Another day, another small town   A summer breeze   The bougainvillea is still in bloom   His room      (phone rings, no-one answers)      The morning comes, they take their showers   They go to work, they do their hours   It's a routine   They lean on..And when you wake you will fly away,   Holding tight to the legs of all your angels..Mississippi river so big and wide, blond haired woman on the other side..Hey mama don't you do me wrong   Come and love your daddy all night long   Oh yes ma'm, you don't do right, don't do right, yeah-yeah

clear, saying just what we feel   Lying in the grass with the sun on our backs   It doesn't really matter what we do or what we say   With every little movement, we give ourselves away      Opposite and opposite, decisions are reversed   Facing one another with words that couldn't hurt   With every little word you're getting closer to me   Talking loud and clear, saying just what you feel today      Talking loud and clear, saying just what we feel   Lying in the grass, we've got time on our hands   Body next to body with silence all around   We understand each other but didn't make a sound   Promises and promises of vows we shall return   Facing one another, I thought my heart would burn   You turn to move away but then get closer to me   Talking loud and clear, saying just what you feel today.Now you see what I am..When I met you, oh   You know at first you had me so confused   I used to lay awake at night   Just copin' with the feelings I so long refused      Well, I surrendered my love   I saw you turn your heart stone-cold to ice, darlin'   I put my heart on the line for you   Oh, I did, I put my heart on the line, yeah   First you take me to the highest ground   Then you keep me hanging like some foolish clown      [Chorus]   It's such a fools' game, yeah   It's such a fools' game   I keep playing such a fools' game, yeah (forever)   I keep on playin', keep on playin' this fools' game   Yeah, this fools' game      I can't take another sleepless night   It's time to light the fire down inside of you   I don't mind: I have the sun on my back      To get a feeling that you never knew   You never knew   Got the secret in the palm of your hands   Will you keep it, woman?.Far, far from here   Still you are near to me      [Chorus]      I have seen you in the evening   In the morning light you hold me   Closer than the air around me   You surround me always      Everywhere I go   I see your face through the crowd   I hear your voice clear and loud   You are the light that I seek   You have found me      [Chorus: Repeat x3].Would you trade your place with jesus on the cross if you could   Shining through eternity ?.Don't cha wish your girlfriend was a freak like me?.(Can I say)   My heart is beating double time, yeah   And do you feel the same?"
"Should the librari be censord on the books it has on the shelvs? I think it should be. There are many offensive books and thangs on the shelvs. I wouldnt want my kid or anybody els kid reading offensive books. So lets get rid of all the bad stuff or atleast filtyer it all.     I beleve any book, movie and magazines that have alot of profanity or bad pictures in them should be removed or not be able to be cheked out to a certion age. If they wana keep teh books on the shelves they should make it where you have to be in high school and have a permsion slip to get the books. Removing teh  books and thangs complitly @MONTH1 cause to much troubl so we should defntly make sure the kid is a certian age and has permsion.     I would not want my @NUM1 year old kid read a book with bad language in it. Kids cach on to that stuff and they will start talking like that and it would not be a good thing. There is alot going on in socaty now a days that badly influnce children. They do not need to read about how guys rob places and are crimanals. I think thats why we have so much of a probly to day becouse evry one sees it at a young age and they want to be lyk that wehn tehy get older but that is a very bad thing. They do not need books and movies that make it worse on them and make them think bad things are good. If we do not filter wat they do at a young age they will end up being hellins and outa of countral becouse they will think just becouse someone in a book or movie did it that its ok for them to do it but its not.     I would not wnat a young kid to read bad things. I say lets put a ge limit on them and mack our socity beeter and are kids to become beter adoults later on in ther life. We need to filter out the bad and put new in for our younger kids. If we don't who knows how theyl grow up to be the world could go to hell if we dont stop the kids from learning bad things.

"Censorship at  the library is not needed at all times. It is the parents who should take the books away from the kids. It isn't the libraries job to tell people what to do. There are certin cases when it's needed though.     It's the parent's job to tell the kids what to do. They are the ones in charge of the kids. they are the ones who should tell teach them right from wrong. They are the ones who are raising the kids, not the library. Other wise, they parents are having their job done for them.     The libraries have the right to get what ever books they want as long as there isn't anything really bad in them. I do get it if they pull off books, movies, and magizines for adults, but if there is one little word in there, people will just have to get over it.     Isn't that why people are wanting classic books, such as '@CAPS1 @CAPS2's @CAPS3' and 'The @CAPS4 of @ORGANIZATION1,' changed? Because black people find it offensive? It's not rignt. People are trying to rewrite history; to sugar-coat the truth. Well, the books are like the real world. People aren't always going to be nice to you. They can be down right mean some times. The whole world is just corupted.     There shouldn't be a problem with just one little bad word in great works of liturature. People will cuss you out if they feel like it while in books, the language limited to one or two bad words. They shouldn't be trying to change great books because the minority find it offensive. The library shouldn't be the ones who tell us what we can and can not read.

"I belive that the view on censorship in libraries are fine as they are for many reasons. The main reasons that i belive censorship in libraries are fine are that almost everything in the library are for people to learn about weather they read it or watch a movie about it. Another reason is that if they took everything that was offecsive or unliked then there would be a lot less information for people to learn about in libraries.     I agree with Katherine Paterson in her quote because it means that if we took away every book that someone found offensive then there would be no books left. Every person has different things that offend them and it would not be possible to remove everything from the library that offended someone. For example, if someone wanted to learn about a historic war from the past, but if someone was offended by the war because they lost a family member or friend to it, should the piece of writing be taken away? Libraries are a place that someone can go to, to learn about something. They hold a lot of information about many different subjects that people go to learn about even if it @MONTH1 be offensive to some people. If someone doesn't like something or finds it offensive then they should just leave it on the shelf and move on because someone else might learn something important from it. There are things in life that people need to be opened to or informed about even though they @MONTH1 not always be plesent. Libraries are the place that people get introduced to these things and if these things are removed then where will people go to be informed about this information.     To sum it all up, yes there are things in libraries that some people @MONTH1 find offensive but other people @MONTH1 learn from it and it would be unfair to take this information away from everyone else. A library is a place to go to learn about different things and should alway have information on different subjects and topics. Many people have learned things from a library that have affected their lives and will keep learning more things as long as they are still opened to a wide source of information..Take the line between us   And hold it close to you,   I want us to get together,   Like lovers do..And I dreamt that one of that noble host   Came forth my hand to claim..I wake up in the morning while you're still asleep   I wipe away another tear from your cheek   This is not the first time you've been crying in your sleep   I know that you're affected by what people say   But I can promise you there will come a day   As long as we're together our love will find a way      [Chorus:]   I would love to run away with you   I wish that I could run away with you   Without a trace, a secret place   Where nothing stands in our way   I would love to run away with you   I wish that I could run away with you   To someplace far, shinning star   The two of us all alone      We were born and raised in two different worlds   Separated by our faith and belief   Our love was not accepted but we were meant to be   And even if they tried to tear our love apart   You and I will always share the same heart   There's nothing they can do cause this is our destiny   I'll give up my life just to be with you   I'll take you where ever you want me to      [Chorus:]      You, and I love belongs to you,   You and I, love belongs to us,   I'll give up my life if you want me to   I'll take you where ever you want to go,   Where you want to go      [Chorus x 2].Don't need a Dictionary      (I said A) Bow chika bow wow, That's

"Censorship in Libraries      I believe that there should be censorship in libraries. In @DATE1's society there are many kids who are hurting and are getting into bad things. There are somethings kids just should not see. Censorship should be used in libraries to steer kids in the right direction, to take some stress off of parents, and because some offensive movies are actually offensive.      Censorship in libraries can steer kids in the right direction. Odds are, if a kid sees his role model on the front of a movie case smoking a cigarette, then that kid is probably going to become curious about smoking. This has happened to me before. I once saw this kid that I looked up to drinking, and I almost took up drinking myself, but because I had the right peers, I didn't. The point is that when kids see someone they look up to doing a certain thing, it has a great impact. If that movie case is sensored then that kid would never even think about smoking because of his role model.     Every parent is worried about their kid getting into trouble with the law, right? Some of the movies that a kid can get at a library has the actors doing illegal things in it. A kid will see this and then they will probably think it is cool and go out and do the same thing. I have seen plenty of movies that made me want to go out and do what they did in the movie. What if that thing they see in a movie is murder? It maybe crazy to think that a kid would go out and murder someone because he saw people do it in a movie, but it could happen. A couple years ago I can remember reading an article in the newspaper about a kid shooting his father in the head. This kid was only six years old, but he thought that playing with guns was safe because he saw them do it in the movies.      Censorship can take some of the stress off of some parents' backs. Parents stress all the time about where their kids are, what they are doing, who they are with, and so on. If the library censors some of the music and movies that kids watch then his parents will not have to worry too much about him going off and doing bad things because he sees his peers do it. This makes parents feel good and confident in their child's life.      Finally, offensive movies are actually offensive, whether this be to the kid himself, the parents, or the audience that the movie is targeting. Keeping offensive movies censored can relieve a lot of hate in a kid's life. I say this from experience. In movies we always see the smart kids getting picked on and it seems like the athletes get all of the attention. Well I am sort of considered that smart kid. I feel that, because of some of the movies my peers have watched, they find it okay to pick on me. This creates hate inside of their hearts, all because censorship was not used.      In conclusion it has to be obvious that I feel censorship should be used in libraries. Censorship should be used in libraries to steer kids in the right direction, to take some stress off of parents, and because some offensive movies are actually offensive. With censorship, all of these things can be accomplished. This is not only helpful to the kids, but the parents as well. In my experience, censorship is a good thing to have..Every morning got sun to shine   Every day got plenty of time   Every night   There's a moon so fine   There for you, my Amber Jean..Never let him see you when your breaking   Never let him see you when you fall   That's how we live   And that's how we try      Tell The world you've got it all together   You never let him see whats underneath   We cover it up   With the crooked smile   But it only lasts for a little while      There's no such thing as perfect people   There no such thing as a perfect life   So come as you are, broken and scarred   Lift up your heart and be amazed, and be changed   By a perfect God   Yea      Suddenly its like a weight is lifted   When you hear the words that you are loved   He knows where you are   And where you've been   And you never have to go there again      There's no such thing as perfect people   There's no such thing as a perfect life   So come as you are, broken and scarred   Lift up your heart and be amazed and be changed   By a perfect God      Who lived, and died, to give you life   To heal our imperfections   So look up, and see love, and let grace be enough      There no such thing as perfect people   Yea   There's no such thing as a perfect life   So come as you are, broken and scarred   Lift up your heart and be amazed and be changed   By a perfect God   By a perfect God   By a perfect God   Yea   By a perfect God   Be changed by a perfect God   Be changed.They say, Ruby you're like a dream   Not always what you seem   And though my heart may break when I awake   Let it be so   I only know, Ruby, it's you      They say, Ruby you're like a song   You don't know right from wrong   And in your eyes I see heart aches for me   But from the start, who stole my heart?.I'm beggin' to you baby please..It doesn't matter what I want   It doesn't matter what I need   It doesn't matter if I cry   Don't matter if I bleed   You've been on a road   Don't know where it goes or where it leads      It doesn't matter what I want   It doesn't matter what I need   If you've made up your mind to go   I won't beg you to stay   You've been in a cage   Throw you to the wind you fly away      It doesn't matter what I want   It doesn't matter what I need   It doesn't matter if I cry   Doesn't matter if I bleed   Feel the sting of tears   Falling on this face you've loved for years.I'm finding out where my head's at   Like loose change in a laundromat   It chews me through   From Dallas Crane to Motley Crue, oh   Yeah, but I know just why I'm masquerading   And why my tracks is fading   And bash out to hammer the blue   Who put the devil in you?.I can wait forever if you say you'll be there too..Shepherds quake at the sight   Glories stream from heaven afar   Heavenly hosts sing Alleluia!.Sayonara Moon up in the sky..Three men out at sea..There's a road outside Columbus, Ohio..And I cry does it make you feel better, sing it      All Gods' children, there they go, taking the free ride.[what we smokin?].Love gives   Love takes   It takes a lot of lucky breaks   Lucky strikes   Lucky stars   I don't know how I got this far   Who knows where it's coming from   Or where it's going to   Can I go all the way with you?.I was lost,   I was scared I was losing my mind..What is love?.(Where I stand?).Chorus:      Turn, Turn, Turn   Turn, Turn, Turn   Turn, Turn, Turn      Verse 1      Bring on all the seasons   Repeat your earlier deeds   Show the children your face   Most of all teach them to...

"No, cause if that is the case evry  book you read could be offense to somebody. If they think the book is bad then don't read it.First off a book should not be banned from a libary.It is just a book.Second the only reason they would want to band a book is because people like to start drama. Third reason every could be offense to somebody.          First off they should not band a book just because people don't like it.If your child read an adult book that is good for them, for reading those big words.And if they just happen to see a naked picture it is not the end of the world. I bet it is not the first and it won't be the last.     Second some people would try to band a book just to start drama. They know it will cause a lot of crazy things with the author.     Finaly If they band books for being offense then they would not have a libary. Cause any body says something is offense.In all they should not band one book..May everyone live,   And may everyone die..Charlie was a loser till that sunny day   No-one saw him leaving as he sailed

"Should we have the right to be able to remove materials from shelves if they are found offensive? I believe that we should not have the right to be able to do this. I believe that if we had the right there would be no materials left for future children to read. A big thing to consider when you think about this right, is even though our materials speak of discrimination, or use a word that someone might find offensive, or even if we did not like the book, movie or magazine and thought that it was a waist of space. We should never have the right to be able to remove these materials.     I know of several people that think the harmless childs first book is trying to discriminate someone, or a race of people. There are books out there that are discriminating certain races of people, or informing us of a time when people were discriminated against. If we would have the right to remove these materials, all of them would eventualy be gone. Our future children wouldnt know that the event even happened or if they did half of their information would more than likely be wrong, since over years people would probably change the story to a version that they wanted their child to think.     If someone found one single word in the book or even a movie that they thought was offensive then they would have the right to remove the material from another persons view. If someone found a curse word in the material that they found offensive, or if they just find the idea of using curse words offensive they would be able have the material removed and that would mean that thousands of good books and movies would disappear for a word that one person did not like.     Some people might find them to be a waist of space and just remove it, if they did not like the book, movie, music or magazine. There are some people out there that like to read or listen to them and @MONTH1 find some of the them that we cant stand to look at, good or entertaining. Some people do not like a book by its size or by how big or small the words are. These arent ways to judge a book.     I think that nobody should have the right to remove a book, movie, music, or magazine from the shelf. We all should keep these materials as a reference to future generations. Past people in the world have destroyed materials that they didnt like, now we will never know what they were about or even trying to tell us. There is no reason to remove a material just for the oppinion of one person or even the oppinion a a group of people..And though his body bids him   To enter in with her,   There was something in her

"Removing certain materials from the shelves of libraries is not the way to go. No matter how offensive they might be, there are many other ways to solve this problem. I believe that certain materials such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should not be removed from libraries for being too offensive.      First off, many people have different opinions about what is offensive and what is not. For example, many people have different intrests than others. Some people @MONTH1 like certain kinds of books and movies while others @MONTH1 not. For instance, one of my favorite types of movies to watch is a comedy. On the other hand, there are many friends of mine that love to watch horror movies. This is something you can not change. Everyone is going to have their own preference on what they want to read, listen to, or watch. Why would you take things away that people actually enjoy? There are other ways to solve this problem.      I believe that we can solve this problem by just seperating certain materials from others in the library. For example, if something is thought to be offensive, then it can be placed with others like it. These materials do not have to be removed completely. Mothers are often worried about their children picking up things in the library that they think are offensive. If these materials are seperated from others, there will not be a problem. Certain materials do not have to be removed completly from a library.      All in all, there is no need to remove materials from a library because many people have different interests. In conclusion, I believe that materials should not be removed from libraries for being to offensive.Are you awake   Have you anything to say   Are you aware of what surrounds you   And all the times

"I'm really sick and my head really hurts at this moment while having to write this paper, so please take @CAPS1 easy on me.      Any source of literature is someone's own creation of imaginiation, taken in whatever direction they so choose for @CAPS1 be to be taken. The creation of that art form as writing would be nothing less then lonesome trash floating the winding streets if @CAPS1 were censored.       @CAPS1 is almost like when watching television; your kids are up and want to stay up late to watch the new horror movie but no way, that movie is way to scary for them, plus @CAPS1 shows some nudity. If the movie is not appropriate for your children then do not let them watch @CAPS1. In a library though, your mother might not always be there to pre-read your books for you. So maybe you just have to assume responsibility and read the book if you choose to, or not read the book depending on how your mother would feel about @CAPS1 of course.      The thought of there being censorship in libraries is quite ridiculous. Of course I would not like to see @PERSON1: @CAPS1 in my childrens section but that is all up to just having books in their right sections. Have the explicit books on one side of the library and the non on the other side. The main point is that most people that make use of the library are old enough to choose a book of their liking and if they are not they have their mother accompanying them.Waiting for that other shoe to drop   And you swear this world's gonna come to a stop   Drowning on dry land a can't come up for air   Your knees are so weak and you look at that mountain   Say there's no way over and no way around it   And it feels like you're so far from home   Even God's not there   But      Oh but every single sparrow flying   And every broken soul that's crying   He can see yeah you're in His reach   If He can hold an ocean back with one little shore   Then what's all this worry and doubting for   Oh I believe He holds everything      When it's late at night and you're staring at the stack of bills   It don't add up and you don't know how it will   Clinging to your mother's faith with a half-hearted prayer   But you still don't know   When the anchor man breaks in on your TV   And says these times they won't be easy   And fear sets in and you wanna give in   Just let it go   Oh let it go      Every single sparrow flying   And every broken soul that's crying   He can see yeah you're in His reach   If he can hold an ocean back with one little shore   Then what's all this worry and doubting for   Oh I believe, yeah I believe He holds everything, he holds everything.(Pretend to shake rattle while making 'chh' sound)         Here is baby's cradle,   (Fingers intertwined, with pointer   Fingers up -- like church steeple)      Soft and warm and white..Mother   You're holding my heart, screaming   Motherfucker   That left me broken, bleeding   Son of   The man you loved and left for   The son of a bitch   Who tried to show me death's door      Oh      Everything's eliminated   Everything is dedicated   To the meaningless stuff i've hated   Everything was overrated      Love song for the dear departed   Head stone for the broken hearted   I'm used to kill, for flowers to steal   Head trip for the mortal earth bound   One sip of the blood that i've found   Lying here   I'm dying here      Ascend   Obituary's rain down   It's our fate   We're lying naked face down      Oh      All together decapitated   Can you see me grab ?.What about sunrise?.Word - feel it!.I love the winter weather   So the two of us can get together   There's nothing sweeter, finer   When it's nice and cold I can hold my baby closer to me   And collect the kisses that are due me   I love the winter weather   Because I've got my love to keep me warm   I love the winter weather   'Cause that's when you and I can get together      There's nothing sweeter, finer   When there's ice and snow   Don't you know I'll hold you tightly to me   And I will get that love that is due me   I love the winter weather   Because I've got my love to keep me warm   Take the summer you can have a ball   Take the springtime or even the fall   But I guess I like the winter most of all      I love the winter weather   When the two of us can get together   There's nothing sweeter, finer   When it's nice and cold I can hold my baby closer to me   And collect the kisses that are due me      I love the winter weather   Because I've got my love to keep me warm   Take the summer you can have a ball   Take the springtime even the fall   But I guess I like the winter most of all   Oh, I love winter.I can't live with all your lies again   I can't trust anything with you my friend      Can't you see the pain in my eyes?.Never wanted to be no pop singer,   Never want to write no pop songs..Blues   From my G.I..Cause you got a big B-U-T, T, see   Can I get wit'cha, can I get wit'cha   Can I get wit'cha, can I get wit'cha   ""Why you wanna get with me?"".But until that morning   Honey, n-n-nothing's going to harm you now,   No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no   No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no   No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,   Don't you cry,   Cry..The best things in live aren't given, these things ain't for you and me,   Every time you shout Forbidden, makes me wonder what you see..Now Simon said within his heart,   Lord if you only knew the kind of woman   That's touching you,   But Jesus knew about her past,   He knew about the sin,   Yet He saw in her a repentant heart   That had come to worship Him..Does your mother tell you things?.Chopped off his hand and said 'Rightio!

"There are many books, music, movies, and magazines that people find offensive. Some people even believe these things should be taken off the shelves. I do not believe that the books, music, movies, or magazines should be taken off the shelves completely. Not everyone finds these things offensive and they should not be taken off the shelves because a few people do not agree with them.     First, people have different views on what they find offensive. Not everyone will find the same things offensive or want the same books or song to be removed. With people always having different views it is difficult to take books, music, movies, or magazines off the shelves for everyone. Just because one person does not agree with what is being said in the movie or book does not mean that every single person wants that movie or book to be removed. If one person found my favorite book offensive I would not want it taken off the shelves completely.      Equally important, if every book, song, movie, and magazine that someone finds offensive is taken off the shelve there would not be many books, movies, songs, or magazines left. Author Katherine Paterson once said, 'But if I have the right to remove a book from the shelf-that work I abhor-then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' @CAPS1 is saying that if every single book that offends someone is taken off the shelves there would be no books for anyone to read. People find different things offensive and if everyone took these things off the shelves there would be none left for anyone.      Finally, if someone finds a book offensive they do not have to read it. When someone finds a book, movie, song, or magazine offensive they don't need to watch it or read it. Instead of taking it off the shelves the person could just not read it. Not everyone finds the same books offensive and taking them off the shelves could upset many people. When someone finds something offensive they could just avoid that instead of getting it removed and upsetting other people. If someone was offened by one of my favorite books, I would prefere if they just avoid reading it instead if taking it off the shelves so that I can not read it.      Some people find many books, songs, movies, and magazines offensive. They would like these things to be removed from the shelves permenatly. I, however, do not believe that these things should be removed. Taking these off the shelves could make some people happy, it could also upset even more. Not everyone finds the same things offensive and should not be taken off the shelves because a few people do not agree with them.I'm blowing up my mind   Lemme lemme see what I can do   (It's summertime, boy!).You seem to come and go   At times my mind is crystal clear   And then I think of you   Then the spin of the room I'm in   Brings you into view   Love that once   Held my mind completely in control   Now makes it spin like tornado winds   As it comes and goes.Since my baby left me I've been losing, I've been losing,   I've been losing my mind, baby baby babe..This ain't serious   This will make you delirious   If we didn't buss   Every artist woulda fraid of us      'Murderer', blood is on you shoulder   Buju gimme di money and report it tomorrow   Tek Mad Cobra drop top a Southboro   Mi mek Frisco walk like him a disco   Rob Roundhead wid out a gun   Teck him chain and run   How a four hundren pound man   Fi try run mi dung   Buccaneer seh widout ooman   Him no have no career   So mi kidnap every gal   Him have and carry dem up a Vere   Warlord no fraid a dread   But mi have plait up head   You di boss but gimme   Di dough before 'people dead'   Gimme di glasses and   Di black skullcap 'pon yuh head   But Ashey yuh n'have nuh money   Dog piss and go a yuh bed   Cassette Jones get extort   Cah him a gwaan well   Mi would rob Cassette Ninja   But him tings nah sell   Spragga Benz, Assassin   Is robable but 'low Lexus, 'cause   Him flop a Sting, yuh simi   If a never DJ game mi go   Irie FM go rob DJ Wayne   Derail di irie train   Tek weh a shiny chain   Same thing for Collin from Fame   Cause mi nuh rob disc jockey when dem lame      This ain't serious,   This will make you delirious..(I don't need)Get rich (no education), or die tryin'..Is that all there is?.Tight..But lately she gets to wonder to herself, what's the good of going on anymore?.I say ""Put your hand right there""   I pulled my groin   I pulled my groin   I pulled my groin   Though I do not enjoy walking   I am really happy talking   'bout my groin   I pulled my groin   I pulled my groin   It's the treatment that I love   Because I've bought some oil to rub   I pulled my groin   I pulled my groin   Unless we're in playoff time   When I've got a lower body injury that   Will have to be a game time decision   I pulled my groin   It hurts me when I skate   But not when I master..

"There I was, shuffling my way through the library, finding the perfect books to check out.  It was then that I had stumbled upon a book that looked incredibly interesting.  The cover page featured a depressed girl with the look of hope plastered on her face and the back included the summary of a book I wanted to get my hands on.  The book, titled @CAPS1, was about a girl who went through some troubled times but found her way out of it.  Stories, novels, magazines, or books on tape of any type find their way onto our library shelves, it is then our job to discover them.  Whether literature includes stories of love and breakbreak, sorrow and depression, or the success of a sports team, it should all be allowed on our library shelves.      Opinion, everyone has one that conflicts with someone elses.  Our world revolves around these different viewpoints and ideas, should our literature and music not reflect these opposing sides?  Literature is an escape for many people, it is their way of experiencing the world and to live through the main character of whatever they are reading.  If we remove books that @MONTH1 be offensive to one, we are taking away that opportunity for others. In my opinion, the removal of the potentially offensive material in our libraries, is sheltering our world.       Regardless of how hard we try, children and teenagers will one day be exposed to the offensive material we are attempting to remove from their lives.  We should not attempt to hide what our actual world is like, rather allow them to experience it in a safe way, like reading or listening to music.  If someone views material as offensive, it should be the parent's responsibility to regulate whether their child reads or listen to it or not.  The removal of the potentially offensive material would not be any help.     In conclusion, offensive material should not be removed from our libraries, rather regulated through our parents or elders.  The idea of regulating what is on our shelves is not the most effective.  If any material has the potential of being offensive, it is not the library's role to regulate whether or not it is displayed to the public.They're the best kind   I love America   Turn me on   Well, I gotta go now   I love America   Bye bye, I tell you what though, I really do love it   You ain't going to catch me at no may-day rally.Please, don't look so downhearted,   Love plays such funny games..It's not the way you lead me   By the hand into the bedroom   It's not the way you throw your clothes   Upon the bathroom floor      Been thinking about you   I just couldn't wait to see   Fling my arms around you   As we fall in ecstasy      Ooh sometimes   The truth is harder than the pain inside yeah   Ooh sometimes   It's the broken heart that decides      It's not the way that you caress me   Toy with my affection   It's not my sense of emptiness   You fill with your desire      Climb in bed beside me   We can lock the world outside   Touch me, satisfy me   Warm your body next to mine      Ooh sometimes   The truth is harder than the pain inside yeah   Ooh sometimes   It's the broken heart that decides      Ooh sometimes   The truth is harder than the pain inside yeah   Ooh sometimes   It's the broken heart that decides.I went down to the crossroads, tried to flag a ride..We have come from the ashes of the burning away   Pouring blood in the fire on the altar of pain   Led into temptation, now the black gods align   Here there is no salvation and your blood is my wine..She's got a trail of broken hearts behind her   Like a shadow where no shadow's cast   I ain't the first one and I doubt that I'll be the last..Pastie suppers down at Davey's chipper   Gravy rings, wagon wheels, barmbracks, snowballs..Nothing   What's That?.You just got to be out of your head   Whe you say you'll go look for the bottom of the top   Well I'll be waiting and won't give it a rest   [?????????????????????????????].Can you pay my telephone bills?.Stop!.You never listen when I need someone to talk to   So you switch the subject   Cause, cause it's beyond you   When you talk about your dreams, I'm never included   I need to stop sleeping on myself   Wake up and do it on my own!.My face like a mannequin..My God,   I don't even think that I love you,   Won't you tell me,   Tell me, tell me, tell me      How could you settle for a boy like me,   When all I could see was the end of the week   All the things we sign,   And the things we buy,   Ain't gonna keep us together,   It's just a matter of time..This is sort of like jazz in it's own peculiar way..I'm gonna walk myself into town and ride on back   Guess it means you're quick and I'm clean   My sparkling machine   It's only forty minutes by feet   I'll be back in three   Ride to the hills at night   To watch the lights go down and your neighbours fight   'Cause I'm the boy to keep you up at night      It's a magic carpet and chrome   Can't reach me by phone   A new deck of cards through the wheels   To show you just deep I feel   In the rear view mirrors I see   My dust as you're following me   Drag to the corner at night   To watch the lights go down and your parents die   'Cause I'm the boy to keep you up at night..All the way from memphis.Intro:Ne-Yo   Timbo   Hey, Ne-Yo   Say what?.All is well all is well   Angels and men rejoice   For tonight darkness fell   Into the dawn of love's light   Sing A-le   Sing Alleluia   All is well all is well   Let there be peace on earth   Christ is come go and tell   That He is in the manger   Sing A-le   Sing Alleluia      All is well all is well   Lift up your voices and sing   Born is now Emmanuel   Born is our Lord and Savior   Sing Alleluia   Sing Alleluia   All is well.Write a fictional story,   For your fee..Won't you change partners and dance with me?.I'm alive when you're touching me,   Alive when you're shoving me down."
"Maybe, to a sense I do not think that boo'ks should be removed to an extent. The reason for this is becasue that some books, magazine and other stuff can be informative. They can help you wtih certain questions. They @MONTH1 not always answer what you need but they are there to look back at and see what type of generation we have.      But, there is also other reasons things that can be offense to others. People @MONTH1 take that aspect to the next level to where they are getting hurt. I think that maybe certain books and magazines should be removed. They tend to do damage to others and can hurt other poeple. The sense of this nautre is to ask the store to remove the books or magazine. The store can not take the books off the shelf if one person is offended by the book.      If you take every offensive book of the the shelf then you will not learn from the other mistakes it has taken on other peoples lives. They maybe think it would be a good idea to books off the shelf but younger adults could not learn the mature items that the parents do not want to terach. They @MONTH1 think they are doing t the right thinking by not showing you sexual offenive stuff. You @MONTH1 not want kids or others to see this sexuality and see what the world is becoming.      Also, I can see why they would want to take that stuff off the shelves. They @MONTH1 not like what they see but they think it is the truth and is very offensive to see the sexual, mental illness people have. Certain books @MONTH1 stay on the shelf such as a @CAPS1 book. @CAPS1 books so the human body they do not hid the human body we should know about the human body. So the @CAPS1 books and magazines should stay on the shelf. If you want to look at naked provakadive stuff then go to a sex store. Do not put out books in public that can show the sexually side of humanbeings.     The @CAPS1 magazines are there to learn not for enjoyment. You can go to a different store for enjoyment. But, if you take off stuff that can be offensive to others then that means you would have to take off the @CAPS1 items. People could get offenive by not looking like the poeple in the magazine. That could offend them so would you take it off the shelf or not. Not you would not becasue a @CAPS1 book is there for you learning envoirment not to ofen you. That also could go for the sexual magaizes. Yes, sex is good for you but would you want to teach that to ounger kids that fast. You would want to teach them about sexual introcourse not a magazine. I know that @CAPS1 books and tapes can be incouraging sex but they are mainly talking to adults.     As far as music and tapes go no I do not think that those types should be removed. That is for enjoyment and people liek to relax to this sorta stuff. I mean I do not buy tapes of @CAPS2's or music but othe people do. They enjoy it if you did take it off then what else would they put up? You have to think about the younger generations. The older generations lived a happy not violent life. But, for teenagers now in certain places they have it hard. They need to make a living on the street. They need something to listen to. This offensive music is to listen sure some music is horrible but what music isnt these days.        If music is what you are instersed in then why would we take it off the shelves. People make a living listeing to music and cerating it for others. It is a wonderful thing it really is what makes the world go around. Making stores and stands take the music and newspapers off would be a disappointment to see such a wonderful thing go down the hole because it hurt others.      If you go back to the @NUM1's there music was about drugs as well and nobody ever had a problem about that. Maybe people don't have a problem with it but its becaseu they grew up around it. Just like we have grown up to the rap and the sexual musice. We are teenagers and you were once a teenager. You know you would not be listeing to a beetles song that wouod not be about drugs or sex or getting high. The beetles sang about all the stuff singers sing about now.      Generations change and so does the enivorment but  you can not change they way we grew up. You can try to make it better but it will take a lot of will power. The generations now are tough and they wont let down. You might as well stop trying to take down what we grew up to away from us. Nobody was trying to take away your music so why would you take away ours.     Its not something you want to take away it's somthing you want to look back and see how much are generations have changed from one to another.A kiss that is never tasted,   Forever and ever is wasted..I can't break the ice,   Shrinks in the heat,   Falling like an acrobat and landing on my feet..Be prepared   To fill you plate   Be prepared   Don't hesitate   Be prepared   For a great big bust   Be prepared   To do what you must   Be prepared   To take a hit   Be prepared   To go for it   Be prepared   For a sneak attack   Be prepared   Just don't look back      They say, where there's a will there's a way   We've heard, these are the things that they say   So....

  For something like a second,   I was healed, and my heart   Was at ease      O baby I waited   So long for your kiss   For something to happen   Oh, something like this      And you're weak and you're harmless   And you're sleeping in your harness   And the wind's going wild   In the trees   And it's not exactly prison   But you'll never be forgiven   For whatever you've done   With the keys      O baby I waited   So long for your kiss   For something to happen   Oh, something like this      It's dark and it's snowing   Oh my love I must be going   The river is starting to freeze   And I'm sick of pretending   I'm broken from bending   I've lived too long   On my knees      And she dances so graceful   And your heart's hard and hateful   And she's naked   But that's just a tease   And you turn in disgust   From your hatred and from your love   And she comes to you   Light as the breeze      O baby I waited   So long for your kiss   For something to happen   Oh, something like this      There's blood on every bracelet   You can see it, you can taste it   And it's please baby   Please baby please   And she says, drink deeply, pilgrim   But don't forget there's still a woman   Beneath this   Resplendent chemise      So I knelt there at the delta   At the alpha and omega   I knelt there   Like one who believes   And like a blessing come from heaven   For something like a second   I was cured, and my heart   Was at ease      O baby I waited   So long for your kiss   For something to happen   Oh, something like this.I can always feel it's there, creeping one step behind

Harder   Life without you baby is hard      You know the whole affair could be   Simply   Settled right from the start   If we both see   There's no chance if we dance in the dark   Lose our way and

"I believe the current way materials are censored and removed works, and should continue. While everyone @MONTH1 dislike a particular novel or book, libraries can not remove every book a person dislikes, as Katherine Paterson said. When a book appears so controversial to the point where the majority of people disapprove of it, then the book usually is taken off of the shelves.     The possibility children will see the offensve material appears unlikely. Most public libraries do not put their offensive material near the childrens books. At my local library, their is a section that has the more offensive or obscene books all in one place. To acquire these books you must have a parents permission or be @NUM1 years of age. It is very unlikely a child would ever see the materials in question.     Numerous people who find the materials offensive must also remember the time and place the story originated. @PERSON3 @PERSON2 @MONTH1 have had racial slurs in it, but if one considers the time and place of the novel, these slurs were normal for the time. Someone can not be frustrated with a novel written @NUM2 years ago because it has something offensive in it by todays standards.     While I believe, for the most part, libraries should not censor or remove materials, there should be some restrictions set in place to keep extremely harmful materials out of libraries. For instance, libraries should not have dirty magazines or movies on their shelves. If a high majority of people want a particular material banned, then it is hard to ignore them. When a book is so vulgar people begin to protest the book, there are questions as to whether the book should remain on library shelves. When a high percentage of people join that cause, then it should be banned.     Censoring or removing materials from libraries remains a hot topic today. I believe the current system in place to censor or remove books does its job, and that it should continue. If few people disapprove of a particular material, the book remains in most shelves uncensored. When a lot of people begin to protest that same material, it has a high probability of being banned. With this process, every book with a racial slur or questionable scene is not removed, while the ones that truly deserve it are removed..He don't need no sedatives to ease his troubled mind..(alternate intro)   Everything'll work out if you let it   Everything'll work out if you let it   Everything'll work out if you let it   Let it in your heart      Everything works if you let it   If you let it in your heart   Yeah everything works if you let it   If you let it in your heart      She is the girl of his dreams   He wants her, he thinks 'forget it'   He's got a pain in his heart he feels like crying   So lonesome for love he feels like dying      But don't stop the dream   He can fix it, I know he can   He's the world's world's greatest   At the work that he does   When he moves on down the line      She is the girl of his dreams   He wants her, he thinks 'forget it'   He'd love to look inside her heart   And see if she agrees      But don't stop the dream   He can fix it, I know he can   He's good, he's great   At the work that he does   And there's magic in the air      Everything'll work out if you let it   Everything'll work out if you let it   Everything'll work out if you let it   Let it in your heart      Good times, bad times don't know what to do   Half the time and all the time   Don't know if it's true   Someday, somewhere know if it's true   She'll look inside her heart and decide   It's really you, whoa      Everything'll work out if you let it   Everything'll work out if you let it   Everything'll work out if you let it   Let it in your heart      Everything works if you let it   If you let it in your heart   Yeah everything works if you let it   If you let it in your heart.If they are fresh prunes Knows no   (cheeky chanky, cheeky chanky)   And they just lay there   Tell me and sing me and just if I don't know   And I know I think The love I have for you   Will never end (well maybe)   And so my love, I offer you   A love that is strong A prune that is true      This is the exciting part   This is like the Supremes, see the way it builds up...

Especially when I know you've gone away      There's a girl from Soho with a teeshirt saying ""I Blow""   she's with the ""jive five 2 plus 3""   And the girls for pay dates are giving cut rates   or

gonna make it soon   This is one place I respected   Now I feel it's really dejected   No-one cares and the people just stare   And a man on the box says   ""Hey you, don't walk away, vote for me

grieving   Friends said go, but my dad said no   And my mum kept saying   ""Don't go, don't go away   Don't leave us, you've got to stay   Just raise them kids, oh mother no""      No prospects, just

weeks to pay   When sunshine calls, but I won't go      This is our town"
"The library is meant to be a place that is filled with materials of all different genres and types. Many of us go to the library because we are looking for something in particular, rather than just browsing. Although some materials that people need to research at the library @MONTH1 be considered inapproproate for certain audiences, it still serves as a useful resource for others. This @MONTH1 include getting information for a research paper, renting a movie that needs to be watched for school, or looking for a certain type of book to read. By taking certain books, music, movies, or magazines off the shelves, we are limiting the amount of materials for people to borrow.     At many schools, students are asked to write research papers. What is considered a valid subject for a high school research paper @MONTH1 include information that is not suitable for all groups of people. A student @MONTH1 write a research paper on the effects a certain drug has on an individual. Just because the student chooses this topic, does not mean that he or she supports it. Some adults @MONTH1 say that information on drugs should not be on the shelves in a library because it @MONTH1 include material that they consider graphic, but a student looks at this material only as a resource for an educational purpose.     My freshman year we read @ORGANIZATION1 and @PERSON1. We also watched the movie to get a better understanding of the differences between our time periods. There is death and violence in the movie, along with a brief flash of nudity. Many would consider even this great literary work as a movie inappropriate. The movie helped us to get a real life picture of how things were back then. We were mature enough to look past the graphic scences and see the movie for what it really was. If this move was taken off the shelf, some people wouldn't have fully understood the story because they couldn't picture it.     Sometimes, we just want a good book to read. Many teens gravitate to the young adult section because it includes age-related material. Many books in this section @MONTH1 include works that have a dark or graphic theme with subjects that are inappropriate for younger children. If we eliminated books from this section because they are being censored, we will end up with even less teens that read. Certain books provide an escape for some teens, and @MONTH1 even help them to confront or deal with problems in their own lives.     If libraries start censoring books we @MONTH1 end up with less and less readers as the years go on. Instead of censoring the books, we should censor the people reading the books. If a parent doesn't want a younger child to read about a certain topic, then they should keep them away from that material. Libraries can put age approval marks on certain books to permit only certain age groups to read them. Authors of the books should not be punished for what they choose to write about by taking their books out of the library. No matter what a person's purpose for reading is, they should have a choice of what kind of material the book contains..[End Chorus]      Living like a ghost you walk   By everyone you know..Ooh, how

"I will be talking about, do think books, music, or even magazines should be removed from libraries if they are found offensive. In my opinion I don't think books, music, movies, or magazines should be removed from shelves if they are found offensive too some people. Because not all people have the same interests.     First of all I think things shouldn't be removed from library shelves because people don't like the items because they get offended. But the people who like the item say like an explicit @CAPS1 they would probably buy it. But also the people who don't the explicit @CAPS2 would get offended and would want it off the shelves.     Another example can be a book. what if a person didn't like what he/she read and gets offended. They would return the book and would not want to sell anymore and wouldn't mention it to a friend. But another person comes along and picks the same book and did like what he/she did read and that person would probably recommend it to a friend.     The same way goes for a magazine also. What if a person gets offended at an advertizement. A person likes it and returns it, then comes along another person who gets offended at it and doesn't like it it shouldn't stop selling for that particcular person.     In conclusion I think things in the library shouldn't stop selling because one person gets offended at it. they shouldn've look at the item in first place..I'll kindle my fires with the words   I can't send you   And the roads I can't follow   And the songs I can't sing      Well, all you young ladies   Who dream of tomorrow   While you're a listenin'   These words will I say   Cling to today with its joy   And its sorrow   You'll need all your memories   When youth melts away..Illegalize guns and lobbying   (Jail murderers and extortionists)   Legalize drugs and prostitution   (Free salesmen and saleswomen)      Murder the government Murder the government   Murder the government And then do it again yeah   Murder the government Murder the government   Murder the government and then   Murder the government.yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah   (Yeah) We'll be alright (ahh!).Ooh, ooh, ooh....Iron sounds sear the wound   Hungry screams fill the air   Kindred blood, infant blood, child flesh for their feast   Judgment falls on the son   Judgment falls on the King   Storm of blood raging free   Taste the blood on my hands      Great sword of flame - split the night   Great sword of flame in the sky   Great sword of flame - rip the night   Great sword of flame in the sky      Open veins, tear his heart, rip the eyes from his head   Under God, under siege bind their souls to deceit   Vengeance wrought by the gods, forged in sin   Forged by me!.Night time in Budapest   So many people are waiting in line   Darkness without a glow   What a night to be watching a Christmas show      What a magical mystery feeling   Dancing at the end of their silvery strings   Almost human in size   Like children with plague in their flesh   These puppets are oh so grotesque      Night time in Budapest   The puppet theater is so dark inside   Gas lamps light the stage   We're watching as the curtain begins to rise      What a magical mystery feeling   Dancing at the end of their silvery strings   Almost human in size   Like children with plague in their flesh   These puppets are so grotesque      Here come the puppets   There is one, two--I see three puppets waiting in the wing   Then they start to walk in line   And suddenly they're all on the stage   I see the puppet master high above on the walkway   He pulls one string and up goes a leg, down goes a head   He pulls one more and he lets them all go      No strings, none of them fall, no strings at all      I take a look at the Little Drummer Boy up on the stage, oh no   I think he looked at me, me, is he alive?.Sitting by the fireside with a book in your hand   Two lazy dogs sittin' watchin' your man   Three roses were bought with you in mind   Three roses were bought with you in mind      I gotta stop and see what I'm on about   Stop and feel what I want I gotta   Stop and see what I'm on about   Stop and feel what I want with you   Ah      Walking through a wonderland, I got you by the hand   Every move we made, just as if it were planned   Three roses were bought with you in mind   Three roses were bought with you in mind      I gotta stop and see what I'm on about   Stop and feel what I want I gotta   Stop and see what I'm on about   Stop and feel what I want with you   Ah.Yesterday, just a dream I don't remember   Tomorrow, still a hope I've yet to endure   I'm out of time   I'm out of rhyme   I'm out of reason   Season's change and leave me out in the cold   The story's old   The tale been told by many scholars   Got a fistful of dollar   And a pocketful of love   God above if you hear me cryin'   I've tried to sell my soul   But no one's buyin'   Lord, strike me down now if I'm lyin'   It's gettin' cold   It's time for dyin..My sweet everything   Hey God, I really don't know who I am..Say you wanna get down, huh?.And as you roll the ball down the alley of      Life...Striking out the pagan religions of the past...

"Should there be censorship in libraries? People think that there should be and some think it shouldn't matter. I think there shouldn't be because maybe some people like those books. I have three reasons why there shouldn't be censorship. My reasons are first people like certain books and should be able to get what ever they want. Second, the libraries should be able to put what ever they want on the shelfs. Third, if you don't like what the books say then don't get the book.      Libraries have many books for you to choose from and you can pick which book you want to check out. Libraries don't need to censor their books because some people might want books like that. Everybody has there own preference on the kinds of books and music that they like. Censorship wouldn't allow them to get what they want which would make them mad. There is all kinds of genres of books and music around, some have more strong language in them then other genres. Some people like their music uncensored and should be able to get it. Libraries and entertainment stores are the ones who buy the books and music not you.     Libraries have the freedom to get what ever books they want to and put them on shelves. If you don't like what certain books or music say then go get something you do like. There is no rule that says you have to get a certain kind of music. Some people like the music genre called rap which does have some strong language in it but its your choice to listen to it. the stores just put the products on the shelf to make money not to get you angry about what the products say. There are sections on the shelves that say what genre they are.     People that want to say something about what the language is like in the book should not have checked it out. You have the right to ask what certain music, books, or movies are like, and movies have ratings on the case. Music and movies have ratings which tell you how strong the language is on the cases. People can not say to monitor that when it tells you everything thats in the movie or @CAPS1. The libraires and stores usually mark the sections on what genre they are. That can tell you where the uncensored parts are. You can stay away from those sections if you find them offensive.      The libraries should not have to censor there books and entertainment store should not need to censor all the music and movies. Its your choice what to get not theirs. People can stay away from those areas that they find offensive. Everybody should be able to get what they want even if it might offend others..I say, it's over, baby..I am a lonely visitor..Call on me baby   When you need a hand..You're blowing down the shaky street   You're hearing my heart beat   In the record breaking heat   Where we were born in time..Drop it..(What!).Call me good   Call me bad   Call me anything you want to baby   But I know that you're sad   And I know I'll make you happy   With the one thing that you never had      Baby, I'm your man (don't you know that?).We was sittin' ducks for the police man..Righteous!.Every place that I go,   Well, it seems so strange..She don't look back, she ain't doin nothin' wrong   Lord have mercy, baby's got her blue jeans on..You guys gonna help us out right now?.All stand up, let me hear you say never say never   All hands up, are you ready for the weekend are you ever   All stand up, let me hear you say never say never   All hands up, let me hear you say we're gonna get together      Working all week till Friday   Wish I could do it my way   Until when I'm living it up   I ain't giving it up   Making the best of my lot   One of these days when I stop   And I'm gonna be living it up   I won't be giving it up   Telling you now it's my day   Oh I'm gonna do it my way      All stand up, let me hear you say never say never   All hands up, are you ready for the weekend are you ever   All stand up, let me hear you say never say never   All hands up, let me hear you say we're gonna get together      The job it just drives me crazy   Guess I'm a little lazy   I don't care 'cause what do they know   They'll be there when I go   Every day feel like screaming   Nothing gonna stop me dreaming   And there's one thing sure that I know   I can't wait for the whistle to blow   Telling you now it's Friday   I'm gonna do it my way      All stand up, let me hear you say never say never      All stand up, let me hear you say never say never   All hands up, are you ready for the weekend are you ever   All stand up, let me hear you say never say never   All hands up, let me hear you say we're gonna get together      Living and loving and learning   Gotta keep the whole world turning   So come on let's give it a try   No use in wondering why   Running away and hiding   Taking our time and finding   If we stop then it's all gonna go   Don't wait for the whistle to blow   Everyday feel like screaming   Nothing gonna stop me dreaming      All stand up, let me hear you say never say never   All hands up, are you ready for the weekend are you ever   All stand up, let me hear you say never say never   All hands up, let me hear you say we're gonna get together      All hands up, let me hear you say never say never   All hands up, let me hear you say never say never   All hands up, let me hear you say never say never say never say.All of the riddle comes perfectly clear..Only models in my section, get them uglies way from me,   And when they be like, I just play dummy..It didn't, but it seemed that way..There we sit on a line, wasting fortunes at a time, and pray..Are your senses racing endlessly   Tracing   Past impressions?.It's raining, It's raining..And I was almost persuaded to strip myself of my pride..Rule cyberspace and crunch numbers like I do?.When it came no one was spared."
"I do not think that libraries or any one should have censorship to books, movies, music, magazines ect. People who put there time to writing all of there thought and ideas in that should not be just thrown off the shelf. People who wrote that stuff have freedom of seach and the wright to write that stuff or say that stuff.      Yes I have read books that I have found offensive or that I don't like, but I dont think they should not be in libraries. They are there because some other people @MONTH1 like that kind of stuff no reason why we should exclude what they like to read out of the libraries that everyone shares and goes to. There would be nothing left in libraries because almost everything out there someone could find offensive.     For example people such as @ORGANIZATION1. People say his lyrics and music say alot of bad stuff but most of his music is about him and his life. He has the freedom of speach to wright and publish that for the world to see and hear. His music is just i @CAPS1 of his life. In history @CAPS2 because he killed people. Should take him off the shelf because jews @MONTH1 think it was offensive, yeah it might be but it lets people know about our history and what has happened. If we keep that cencored who know history my repeat its self. which is a saying I have heard many of times.          So censorship or not I just think they had the freedom of speach to write that stuff down and be put in a library for people to see learn, edgucate, and entertain themselves by. Doesn't mean if it offeneds you that its offensive to other people.(Take my hand..A fiddle and guitar band, yeah...And if you do not know me, then how could you be my friend?.la la, la la la la! ).Its

myself alive on the inside   So I could shut you out   And let you go away for a long time      I guess it's okay I puked the day away   I guess it's better you trapped yourself in your own way   And if you want me back   You're gonna have to ask      I think the chain broke away   And I felt it the day that I had my own time   I took advantage of myself and felt fine   But it was worth the night   I caught an early flight and I made it home      I guess it's okay I puked the day away   I guess it's better you trapped yourself in your own way   And if you want me back   You're gonna have to ask

"Dear @CAPS1,     @CAPS2 are many books, music, and magazines that are saturated with offensive words or obscene themes.  However, just because a book or song contains an foul word does not mean that the book needs to be sheltered from the public's eyes.  @CAPS2 are many reasons we should not censor public media.  We cannot ignore wrongdoings happening in our world; plus, in @LOCATION1, we have the freedom of speech; and, finally, if media was censored, people @MONTH1 start to think every little word has an offensive connotation.     If a bystander observes a person being abused in a hallway or alley, the bystander just cannot pretend like the incident never happened.  If the world never reported accidents, @CAPS2 would be too much crime and terror.  Sometimes, a book or movie is like a cry for help or a way to raise awareness about some wrongdoing in the world today.  Most of the time, I only hear about an event through movies or books, and I want to know the honest story, not a fairytale version of it.  After all, if the language in some slavery books was not as vivid as it is, some people @MONTH1 not oppose slavery as strongly as they do.    Here in @LOCATION1, we have the freedom of speech.  We are allowed to give our opinions on any topic, and describe it in any way.  We should be permitted to say anything we want, even though in our hearts, we should know what is right and wrong.  People should at least be trusted enough to use their own conscience.     Also, another reason why books and other media should not be censored is because people @MONTH1 judge almost every little word offensive then.  Then we @MONTH1 have 'no books left on the shelf' according to Katherine Paterson.  Once people are allowed to censure books or other media, they would look for words with negative connotations.  If a word was close to being offensive in one person's perspective, it would be left out.  Then, many words would be gone.     Sure some types of media, especially songs and movies, just spill out nasty themes and foul language.  However, I have the choice to watch a movie or listen to a song.  I can always change the radio station if I do not like what I am hearing.  People however, just cannot remove the words of another right from their mouth, no matter how bad it is.  We just cannot pretend that we all live in a perfect world where everyone is polite and caring.  If we hear about something wrong in our world today, we need to act.  However, we might not act if we do not know the full extent of its terror.                                                            Sincerely,                                                              @PERSON2.It's a tiny little heart that challenges the coin   But the coin has no north or no south   Big coin says it will never ever leave you   Big coin, big mouth.L.

"Books That Are Offensive     @CAPS1 view point is that books should not be taken off the shelfs if taken offensive to one person. Sometimes people get help from books that are offensive to others because somebody is doing something wrong and the book @MONTH1 help the other person. Everybody should be able to read a book if they want in a library. In a library everybody should have the right to read every book.     The idea of taking a book off the shelf is a bad because people want to read books like that. Some people have a problem with that type of book but if they don't like it then tell people not to read it not take it off the shelf. If anything put it in a different area or just move it put all that type of book in one area not mixed in.     When people need help they read a book or look it up. So if the book is offensive but can help somebody with problems then don't even move it. People do have a reason to read books that are offensive. We don't know all of the reasons but there are alot of them.     If a movie is not good for children or just very horid it @MONTH1 need to be put in a place where nobody will look. Kids and grown ups are the same and nobody needs to see a movie if it is really bad.       Usually when somebody takes something offensive they are guilty of something and know they are but will not admit it. People think other people write things that are just offensive on purpose ,but they don't they write it and somebody is guilty if something and can not live up to it. Sometimes just the reading is read wrong and misunderstood.     Everybody has had a book that they thought was offensive but then the next person read it and they might think it is funny. The biggest problem is some people can't read. then some people read so fast they do not comprehend it correctly.     I don't feel like them certain materials should be taken off the shelf if found offensive because that person @MONTH1 be feeling guilty of something. If the materials should be moved they should just be moved to a different area not off of the shelves totally. If it is taken offensive they should tell the librarian and then if very many more people say it is offensive then it can be taken off the shelf..Being boring is the way to go!.I'll make you feel better..They got stuck in the revolving doors   All over this world..Oh dear God we ask for your favour   Come and sweep through this place   Oh we desire You      I just want to be with You be where You are   Dwell in your presence oh God   Oh I want to walk with You      And I will climb this mountain   And I'll step of the shore   And I have chosen to follow   And be by Your side forever more      Tell me what You want me to do Lord God   Tell me what You want for my life   Its Your's Oh God it's Yours   Do your will   Have Your way   Be Lord God in this place   Oh I want Your will to be done.I've dishonored one who trusted me,   I have broken all the rules..(without ya loving in ma life?.Bells ring!.I got kicked off Noah's Ark   I turn my cheek to unkind remarks   There was two of everything   But one of me   And when the rains came tumbling down   I held my breath and I stood my ground   And I watched that ship go sailing   Out to sea..yeah!.I lost out..See the boy on the walkway   Where the young have their own say,   And it screams from the wall..If I promised boy to you   That I'll never talk again   And I'll never love again   I'll never write a song   Won't even sing along   I'll never love again      How, how, how so speechless   You left me speechless, so speechless baby      Will you ever talk again?.Baby, you just knocked me out, bop, bop!.Please help the cause against loneliness   Would you like to note my home address?.I heard a lonely woman cry for a   young man!.How she cried when I left her   I know it filled her heart with pain   She said, son, please don't leave me   For we may never meet again..Bury my heart   at Wounded Knee!.Be here with me now      Do you ever think that   We're just chasing our tails?.The only good god is a dead god..And can you tell me   Why I'm afraid it's me?.Every time i face this pain   I hear it coming back again   And i've been calling out your name (can't you hear it?).Lala how the life goes on."
"Newspaper staff and/or whom it @MONTH1 concern,      Reading material found in a library is very useful and informative to the world, there is no limit to what could be found on paper. Whether it be offensive or not, having limits to books will only create tension, effect the economy, and will lead to illegal activity, ironically enough, in which offensive books will be written and sold, completely undercover.      In today's world, it would be nearly impossible to pick up a book and factually state that it is not offensive. Almost everyone has some little issue with something in the world today, and because of that, original and unoffensive material are hard to come by. With the stripping of offensive material from libraries, authors will be devastated, not just emotionally, but will be out of a job and will have less income. Because of how virtually impossible it is to write a book that is not offensive, authors will become very frustrated, and most are very passionate about what they do. Also, because almost all reading material is offensive in some way, there will be little to no reading material on the selves of the world or nation's libraries. @CAPS1 could potentially lead to violent protests that quickly tear down even the most successful of nations. However, physical devastation would not be the only toll paid for the stripping of offensive reading material from libraries      Books cost money; to make books costs money, to buy books costs money. Paper companies would take a major nose-dive in the market, having almost no clientel. When a major divistion such as the paper industry falls, it will bring others down as @CAPS2, and due to the nation's market complexity, almost all major companies rely on paper. @CAPS1 would ruin the economy. Some might say, '@CAPS1 means that the people of @LOCATION1 will be much more green!' @CAPS2, the past few centuries when economics and the environment are put on a scale, economics takes the cake by a mile. Obviously, @CAPS1 will do much more harm than good. The people of the world always have a priority. Also, the majority of the people don't enjoy having something taken that they have grown so fond to.      People, in general, want what they can't have. An obvious example would be illegal drugs; the drug market is extremely successful, but it's illegal. If people were to have these currently illegal drugs for their use, being completely legal, chances are that the success of drug marketing will plummet. The opposite situation for books: We have them now, but when they are taken, we will want them even more. People who read tend to be very passionate about literature and very intellegent. All it takes is one group to gain numbers, and have a very talented speaker persuede others to follow in a potentially violent revolt to be given back permission to write and publish alleged 'offensive' books. All other material found in libraries, such as music and movies, being taken away will have the same effects, give or take a few similarities or differences.      Avoiding such problems is easy, keep the books and all other material in a library on the shelves. It will only be problematic to take it all away, especially for being offensive, when there are very few books that the general population will find not offensive. If keeping the material in libraries means individuals will become offended for very different reasons, let it be organized chaos. @CAPS1 is how people work, and keeping the material on the selves is how the people are pleased or motivated.The birds like leaves on Winterwood,   Sing hopeful songs on dismal days..Reflections of a person that used to be..Hey, do you know what's going on   Do you?.I

"Censorship helps prevent people from viewing, listening, or read disturbing images or ideas for certain age groups. But in the case of libraries, all the books would have to be taken off the shelves. And if all the books are taken off the shelves, then all the books in stores would have to be thrown out as well.     Books are essential part of life. They have great ideas and thoughts expressed through these amazing pieces of word art. People who think that the books in libraries should be censored, are fools. These people want to keep their children and themselves safe, and that is understandable, but at the same time they are hurting people with the decision they have decided to put forth. Authors are hurt because it is their work that is being censored. People who enjoy reading the books, that are wanted censored, would no longer be able to read those books.     It is mainly the choice of the person to avoid these books if they truely find it offensive to themselves. They should not go all out of their way and try to censor them, because they would eventually might cause everyone or some people to think that they could find a book that should be censored. And if that happens, then there would be no more books on the shelves. The government will take notice and ban these books or worse remove all books forever just like what happened in @CAPS1 @NUM1.     Over all, books are a good thing. They gives us inspiration, and help us pull through life with the thoughts expressed in them. It is your choice to avoid the books that upset you, not what other people think about them..Swagger just flow sweeter then honey oats..Hold her hand through the black light   Baby it's a forest land of trick slides   Honey just take your time   Close her eyes      ""I'm scared,"" she whispered   As she wants to hide   Into a back room where   She paints on a smile   She hears a sound   She hears a sound      It could have been love   It could have been anybody   Anybody, uh-oh   She waited for love   But there wasn't anybody   Around so she left   Town with the rock show      Keep it cool at the freakshow   Baby it's a happy place   If you lose it, honey   Just take your time   Close his eyes      ""Touch me,"" he whispered   As he walks to the light   From the window   There's visions of   A house in the night   He hears a sound   He hears a sound      It could have been love   It could have been anybody   Anybody, uh-oh   He waited for love   But there wasn't anybody   Around so he left   Town with the rock show      Hold her, tell her that you need her   Please undress her slowly, uh-oh   Never hold the girl too tightly   She can't breathe when you speak   Uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh      It could have been love   It could have been anybody   Anybody, uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh   We waited for love   But there wasn't anybody   Around so we left   Town with the rock show      Rock show, rock show, rock show.Like anyone I knew a Dave   Drove a Plymouth shallow grave   Said, ""my girl don't just walk, she unfurls""   With motorcycle language   He stumbled through his slang pledge   Then he dragged the mud for wedding pearls      He closed both his eyes and sort of gave her a kiss   Said ""don't worry baby about what you're gonna miss   There will always be a much much more than this   Every time you go, you are all I see   Holding out for you and me      Pulled down his birthday suitcase   Brown with dust from no place   Said, ""I think its time we made a start""   They danced the waltz of charity   No car garage, two kids for free   They were pissing bliss and playing parts      She closed both her eyes, sorta gave him a kiss...

"Libraries in @LOCATION1     I am going to write a persuasive essay about what I think about some books and magazines that some people find offensive thing in the book. I dont think that just because it is offensive someone it should be taken off the shelf, because some people have different views over the book or magazine. So I am going to tell what I think over this subject.          I think if someone dose'nt like whats in the book they should just not read it or something, because some people might find it interesting. People just need to stop being so selfish and start thinking about others. For example the author of the book or magazine some how relates to them, and they probably made it so other people could relate to them also. Thats why I think people should not argue about taking books off the shelf and start thinking of others. Thats what I think about people trying to take the books off the shelf.     So whoever is reading this please take this in consideriation and relize that some people like different books than others. So don't start taking books off the shelf just because a few people find them offensive. So thats all I have to say about people that are trying to get them taken off the shelf because there offensive to them.Oh what fun it is to ride,   In a one-horse open sleigh,   Hey!.Well, I'm sitting on the bus   Rolling down through Georgia   Don't know where I'm going   And I don't care what's new   I've got nothing to lose      Well, I've had no sleep   Going on three days   Smoked my last cigarette   Somewhere near Atlanta   It's true, I've got nothing to lose      Nothing to lose since I've lost you   Feeling all alone   Used to have it all and now my heart is gone   It's true, I've got nothing to lose      Well, we're coming up on Macon   Gonna rest here a spell   Making idle conversation   With a stranger without you   I've got nothing to lose      Nothing to lose since I've lost you   Feeling all alone   Used to have it all and now my heart is gone   It's true, I've got nothing to lose      Ooh, nothing to lose   Ooh, since I lost you      You left me with no worry   You left with no cares   And you took my whole life with you   And you left me standing there   It's true, I've got nothing to lose      Nothing to lose since I've lost you   Feeling all alone   Used to have it all and now my heart is gone   It's true, I've got nothing to lose      Yes, it's true   I've got nothing to lose      I've got nothing, nothing left to lose   I've got nothing, nothing left to lose   I've got nothing, nothing left to lose   I've got nothing, nothing left to lose      Nothing left to lose.Someday soon   Someday soon   Familiar freaks will fill your living room   Rugs lash out their lizard tongues   You're not getting young   You're not getting young      But you're going to die   And you're going to be needing all of your eyes      You'll be all alone   When the animals cry   All by yourself   In some infancy's lie      Someday soon   Someday soon   Television bleeding like a harvest moon   Flush the scissors down the hole   You're getting old   You're getting old      And I hate to remind you but your going to die   And you're going to be needing all of your lies      You'll be all alone   When the animals cry   All by yourself   In some infancy's lie      Someday soon   Someday soon   Someday soon   Someday soon.You could be faking and breaking and taking it all..He had it coming, he had it coming   He only had himself to blame   If you'd been there   If you'd heard it   I bet ya, you would have done the same!.You say it's easier   Alone and undisturbed   You said yes and danced before   And got your feelings hurt   You say most days your good   It's not so bad this room   Watching the rain today   Even though it's clear and sunny   And you fight it so hard   How to tell if it's real or not      [Chorus]   Take a breath and listen (listen)   Open up stop wishin' (wishin')   All that you've been missin' (missin')   Standing in front of you   Everything you're fearin' (fearin')   All the walls you're buildin' (buildin')   Take a chance you're reason (reason)   Standing in front of you   Standing in front of you   Standing in front of you   Standing in front of you      You start to sway again   Feelin' good in your skin   You start to remember when   You didn't have to try   And then the glitter turns to dust   The color fades enough to make out pictures of a fire   That burns like love   You can close your eyes don't worry   I'll still be here in the morning      [Chorus]      And they won't break us   And they can't get through   'Cause I'm gonna be here   Standing in front of you      [Chorus].Grandma take me home!.I got your letter   I felt so scared to   Pick up the paper knife and read within   I read the contents   I got what you meant   I know its hard for you but don't give in   Maybe, maybe slow things go fast   Maybe, maybe its all in the past      Chorus:   Oh oh if you need me don't let go -

" Censorship in Libraries     I think that censorship in a library is fine some people @MONTH1 feel that children don't need to see certain things. Which that @MONTH1 be true there are a lot of things that even adult shouldn't even see themselves. If there is going to be bad things in the library the owners might make a section just for those things.      People should have the right to be able to look at anything that they want in the library.Are you kidding baby?.They're not down to earth and real like me,   Oh no!.Rupert Sheldrake in his book   Seven experiments that could change the world   Has stated that scientists' attitude   Toward their experiments affect   The results of their experiments..Cause we the mean girls   Y-yes we so fetch   And when we in the yard   Be jumping double dutch   We back to the future,   Pearl ya with da best..Looking up I see her signal with her fingers through her hair   Telling me the hands are clean..You went and you broke my heart, honey and it did not   You know I said it did not belong to you..Or I will still be a flunky, a diploma-less monkey      (Or he will still be a flunky, a diploma-less monkey)      In the eyes of this person   Whose opinion may worsen   If my evil invention's not great      I must impress my professor!.In the snow with Rosebud   And king of the mountain      Elvis are you out there somewhere   Looking like a happy man?.The love that you gave me has gone with the rain   The joy that just filled me has turned into pain      My face in the mirror reminds me of you   It's the one that you lied to when you said you'd be true      The tears in my eyes are all that you'll find   The scars on my face just deepen my mind      The love that you gave me has gone with the rain   The joy that just filled me has turned into pain.Long ago Baby Buffalo,   What's become   Of old Cotton Eyed Joe?.I have read, somewhere in a book,   They improve all your food and your wine..Matter of fact, you're on the right track   My future looks black and blue....I'm interrupted by a doorbell      3:52, who the hell   Is this?.Chorus:      Baby girl I wanna give my all to you   There's nothing in this world I would'nt do..???.[Chorus].(Emmanuel.).And it was wrong of me to ever let you go..Did you ever know you'd be heard in   The middle distance   In some over-the-mountain town?.And angels' wings?.I'm so sorry, I'm so confused,   Just tell me, am I out of time?.Will the sun ever shine?"
"Libraries are a place where anyone can find books to read, on any topic they choose.  This is a right that should stay in the reader's hands, and not the library's.  Every person can read about whatever topics they please, and those working at libraries should not have an influence on which books peole read.     Censorship of books is competely unneccessary.  If somebody wants to read about a specific topic, then they have the right to.  Reading a book that is offensive to the reader is the reader's choice; nobody forced them to read it.  Upon finding a book that is offensive, the reader then can make that decision, and not read the book.  Though just because this one reader finds this book offensive, does not mean a different person would, and this different person has the right to read this book if they choose.     Finding a book offensive is a simply an opinion, and has no factual evidence.  So who has the right to say whether a book is offensive or not?  Just because somebody running a library belives a book to be offensive or innappropriate, does not mean the book should be taken off the shelf.  There is no one person who can say whether or not a book is offensive.     Other items such as music, movies, or magazines also should not be censored, though some of them are already.  Movies for example, are all rated, and this therfore gives the viewer the choice of what level of movie they would like to watch.  The viewer should not expect to check out a rated '@CAPS1' movie, and see no material with foul language, violence, or other 'offensive' subjects.  By choosing a higher rated movie, the viewer is making their own choice of what they see, and so the librarians should not take it upon themselves to take away these films.  It is simply not thier responsibility.     Music also is rated, and if thought neccessary, has a parental warning label, telling the listener that this album has explicit content.  Though just as with movies or books, everybody has the right to listen to whichever music they please, and should not have to search at places other than a library, because the librarian thought the music to be innappropriate.     Magazines @MONTH1 not be rated, but this does not mean the library should make the executive decision to rate them, and get rid of the ones found to be 'offensive'.  As mentioned several times above, it is the reader's choice to view material; not the librarian's.     Whether the material is books, music, movies, or magazines, the consumer has the right to read, listen to, or view whatever they please, without the influence of librarians.  Each person has their own say of what material they choose to consume, and nobody else has the right to tell them otherwise..""See the light ram through the gaps in the land."".She wants a man with

"Should certain material found to be offensive be removed from the shelves of our library? Many people find material they see in libraries such as books, movies, music, magazines, etc., to be offensive; but does that mean that they should be removed? I believe along with many others that libraries should not censor out offensive materials. To censor libraries would neglect parent responsibilities, destroy our profitable media, and be unconstitutional.      Parents are responsible for their children, not only when it comes to providing food and shelter, but also when their children are viewing inappropriate or offensive material. If you do not want your child to be offended or see vulgar shows, texts, and music, do not let them see it. For instance, if a child is listening to a sexual song on their I-pod take it from them. It is not a right to have the device it is a privelage and parents are aloud to take away privelages.     In addition to neglecting the parent's responsibilities, it would be a gigantic blow to the media economically. Most media is viewed, because of the inappropriate material appearing in their shows, books, and music. If you censor all of that material out less movie tickets will be bought, less books will be sold, and less music will be listened to. In a time of recession, like the one we are currently coming out of it is more beneficial to provide as much income as possible, instead of destroying current oppurtunities for profit.      Both of these points are valid, but most importantly censoring libraries would be unconstitutional. In the preamble we are given rights to the freedom of speech and press. These offensive materials are included in this right. I understand admentments can be added to specify what type of speech and press is appropriate, but how will officers monitor that. Not to mention all the jail space that would be needed for people smuggling inappropriate material to buyers.      In brief censoring libraries is a bad idea in the areas of parent responsibilities, media economics, and our constitutional rights. When negatively effecting all of these areas the consequences are much more influential then the benefits. Obviously censoring is not the answer to offensive material.She don't wear nylon hose, oh no..[squirrel noises]      Peeper: trying the squirrel thing again..Got blood in my eyes for you, babe,   I don't care what in the world you do..Don't compromise..Then one night, the walls finally closed in,   I came home late, she said ""Where have you been?.Etc!.The iller, villa in Barbados?.Ah ..., but before we do, I feel that ah ..., I have to tell you something because I know that if you were in my place that you would do it for me..Just give me the kiss of life..Rappers just started rappin last week, get a deal next week   And go platinum next month   But pass the blunt, so I can stay hy- like -dro   Don't act like you don't know, I'm about to fly a flow   I'm three from three from a three-point land   With more devastation than a nigga can withstand   Remember me?.But now I'm lost in the crowd,   No shadow of a doubt   It's all over now,   No shadow of a doubt..So then you put me back in my place,   So I might start another day,   And once again, I will be   In a march to the sea..Can't get enough (Call me, baby!).Well I says ""Lukey the blinds are down""   Ha, me boys!.But I can't change yesterday      [Chorus]   Oh I   Can't take another day without you   Cause this heart don't beat the same without you   I forgot who I was   Got caught up in this world   Jesus I apologize   I should've lost my mind without you   Not another sleepless night without you Jesus   I'm sorry and I'm asking please   Make us how we used to be      I try and try to keep my mind on you   But trouble keeps calling me   Every time a wound heals   Something else takes the healing away   But even when I've gone too far   You don't even call my name   Mama said if you love let it go   And if it comes back then it's back to stay   You already knew I belong to only you   I run to your arms and say      [Chorus]      Never knew a life so cold   Thought that things could fulfill my soul   Tried to find love on my own   It was hard to admit I was wrong   No money, no cars, no fame, no lies, no games my life is taken      Now we've come to the break   Tell me what you gone say (you gone say)   I know (I know)   I give my life right   But you know   You ain't promised tonight   Babygirl   Without you   (I can't breathe)   Without you   (I can't exist)   Without you   (This world ain't got nothing for me   I'm coming home)      [Chorus 2x].""You forgot some spiders in my room yesterday   Now I've got this stunning pain   And my neck is feeling weird, oh I might die   Overnight some of your spiders must have bit me   They were all over me!"".All you wanted was to go out and play..Tell me why did I fall in love with you?.The last time I saw her face   Her eyes were bathed in starlight   And her hair hung long   The last time she spoke to me   Her lips were like the scented flowers   Inside a rain-drenched forest   But that was so long ago   That I can scarcely feel the way I felt before   And if time could heal the wounds   I would tear the threads away   That I might bleed some more   The last time I walked with her   Her laughter was the steeple bells   That ring to greet the morning sun   A voice that called to everyone   To love the ground we walked upon   Those were good days   The last time I held her hand   Her touch was autumn spring   And summer and winter too   The last time I let go of her   She walked away into the night   I lost her in the misty streets   A thousand months, a thousand years   When other lips will kiss her eyes   A million miles beyond the moon, that's where she is   The last time I saw her face   Her eyes were bathed in starlight   And she walked alone   The last time she kissed my cheek   Her lips were like the wilted leaves   Upon the autumn covered hills   Resting on the frozen ground   The seeds of love lie cold and still   Beneath a battered marking stone, it lies forgotten.Sing a lullabye of sweet love to me..When people ask me what I mean, I say   D-D-D-Do I stutter!.Trees are growing day by day,   And people are loving in their own way."
"No, I do not believe that anything should be taken out of a library because someone thinks it's offensive. I believe that poeple have the right to read what they want and so do authers have the right to wright what they want. One of the @CAPS1 of @CAPS2 statements is @CAPS5 of speech giving people the right to say and wright what they want.     People shouldn't take anything out of libraries because libraries are built for storing things like books, magazines, music, and movies. If people start to take those things away then what use would be for a library. If everything is taken out then nobody would have any reason for going to a library.     This brings up the @CAPS1 of @CAPS2. ''@CAPS5 of speech'' meens that people have the right to wright what they want to. if others find it offensive, then don't reed it. Also @CAPS5 of expresion lets people do this to. If people wish to express themselves by reeding it then they have that right.     One of my personal experiences is that I love music, so do my two best friends. One of them goes to the library to find music and we both listen to it. He found these bands I had never heard and I realy liked them. If someone found them ''offensive'' I would have never got to hear how good they were.      This is why I believe that people shouldn't take things out of the libraries. not only does it deny others of something they could love but it also destroys history. libraries will be around for a long time and they store so much information,it would be a shame to deny future people the right to read these wonderfull peices of work someone worked real hard on to create..What's it like to be a loon?.Why this hesitation?.And I'll be (your work I'll take no rest)..Ten thousand men on a hill,   Ten thousand men on a hill,   Some of 'm goin' down, some of 'm gonna get killed..With this foolish heart?.Rain falling down outta my eyes,   And I'm wonderin' why you had to say goodbye   And leave me baby, all in my life..Gotta run won't get my time   All my way we do some life      Oh to be, to be my man..

"I belive that beople have the right to know and learn about stuff even if it is found offensive, the reasone why i say this is because if one person finds it offensive doesn't mean that another person might think it is. If people think that a film from back in the late @NUM1's about the @ORGANIZATION1 that is used for educational perposes is racist, then they need to just grow up and to go back to school for this stuff. Just because some people think that a book with vulger language is offencive then they need to know that more than half of the worlds book have profanitey in them and just because it does, doesn't mean that they need to be removed form the shelfs in the library.     I have had my own incounters with books that i thought were offencive, there was a book that i was reading in my fresh year of high school and there were people in it that were part of the @PERSON2 and they were having meetings and one guy said that he hated negros and they he had picked one for tonigh and were going to lynch them with the nuse they had made the night before and that really hurt me because I have some one in my famliy that is black and to think about someone doing that to him, that would just break my heart and I would probaly go out and find the people that did it and kill them.       In the quote that was writen by Katherine Paterson, she talked about how if she has the right to remove a book then we do to and if we do so then there will be no more books left for us on the shelf is a great way to say that almost everybook we have has something volger in them and if we were to take them all away then there would be none left. If there was the posibility of all the books being taken away from us then there would be a huge uprising and everything would be going down hill form there, because there are people that can't go a day with out reading a part of there book and some people have devoted three hours to reading ounce a day.     What im trying to say is that there is no way to get rid of our books today that have volger langage or something offencive in them because if we tryed to do that then we would be taking every book away in the world and then no one would be learning anything.Let me say once more that I need you,   One more time or just maybe two..I'm a punk get off my ass   Because I'm fucking working class   I get up everyday and go to work   I'm treated like a fucking jerk   They suck my money every week   Now my future's looking bleak   They say the money's almost gone   But what will I do when my time comes      Hey!.You can look, tell me what you see..Take it guys!.Oh why not enjoy yourself by the fireside?.Had you been there tonight   You might also have known   How the world may be changed   In just one burst of light!.Do you hear me?.Don't open that cupboard   I don't want no bones falling out      [Chorus].Its all in you (everybody!).All things bright and beautiful,   All creatures great and small,   All things wise and wonderful,   The Lord God made them all..This ground is not the rock I thought it to be..Do you remember when we used to sing,   Sha la la la la la la la la la la te da   Just like that   Sha la la la la la la la la la la te da, la te da      So hard to find my way,   Now that I'm all on my own..Hello!.I wasn't born lookin' back, I can't tell white from black   Kesey next to me now darling, straighter than a railroad track   I've been so high, my mind was dry      I rent it out to farmers on the midnight ride   That ain't all   I ain't even got me a congressman I can call   I seen 'em dumpin' garbage, in my rivers and lakes   All right   I seen 'em send up John Sinclair, you know   Two joints is all it takes      Then suddenly I was in a tree   And dogs were barking up at me   Can't you see   I'm so damn apethetic, I can't believe I'm free      As the senator he signs the bills you know      And he's telling us which way we have to go      Think it's time we got together and declared   When you see them coming and you get so scared      Rain is falling down, but you know I'm feeling fine   I think I'll watch the tv set, let America steal my mind   But you know I'm cool, Momma had a rule   She didn't raise no fool to be true to someone else   I'm gonna be myself   I'm runnin' down that highway child      Highway child   Highway child.Everywhere I go,   Everyone I know   Whispers that you're growing tired of me,   Say it isn't so..No one ever told me   During all those tears I cried   That one day you would hold me   I just kept hoping inside      True love was waiting   True love would find me in time   True love was waiting   Your love would finally be mine      No one ever showed me   Such care and tenderness   Baby you know me   And what moves me the best      It's true love waiting   It's true love making up for lost time   It's true love waiting   Your love it's finally mine      And I can't erase these lines on my face   But I'd turn back time if I could   But all the years wanting, the desperate longing,   Are maybe what makes this so good      True love, waiting   True love that found us in time   True love is waiting   Your love is finally mine      True love is waiting   Your love is finally mine.Is this the way   You want it to be   Is this the way   It's gonna be   It's gonna be      Oh my God, oh my God   What we gonna do   In this world   In this world we live in   In this world we live in      I see these men   Every day at the corner   Of Queens and Commissioner   Begging for a dollar every day   Begging for a dime every day      Trying to make a living   Out there   But it's so hard   But it's so hard      Begging for a dollar   Begging for a dime   Begging for a dollar   Begging for a dime      One of them   Swallowed his pride   His broken pride   And came to me, he said   I quit, I give up   What are the rules   What did I do to deserve this   Begging for a dollar every day   Begging for a dime every day   Trying to make a living   Out there      Begging for a dollar   Begging for a dime.Bidin' my time,   That's the kind of guy I'm,   While other grow dizzy, I'll keep busy,   Bidin' my time..Give me the gift of your sweet love   In the light of the day,   In the dark of night..I heard it all before, I've heard it all before   I can't hear it anymore   Your hair was long, your eyes was blue   Guess what I'm gonna do to you      Oh, how I cannot bear the thought of you   I said, oh, how I cannot bear the thought of you   We were young and we were pure   And life was just an open door   I said oh, oh, how I cannot bear the thought...

"My views are that if it is offensive to someone or other people the certain maeterial shouldn't be taken off the shelf. I think you should have to have permission from a parent, or guardian if the material is explicit. For example in a store where you buy cd's, games ect... you have to be of age to buy the material that should be the same with books.          Say a book has a certain word on it like '@CAPS1' it shouldnt be taken off the shelf just because of its name. That brings up the subject don't judge a book by its cover. Just because the name isn't to someones standards it shouldn't matter. Pick the book up read the back and see what it's actualy about. Then if it's what you was exspecting it to be talk to someone who is in charge, and explain top them what the problem is in your case.     Also you could always have a section of the store, or librarie just for adults only. It @MONTH1 sound stupid, but it can actualy help out alot. There is tons of books out there that have things in them not appropriate for children. Such as love books, they talk about love, and passion in ways that are very innappropriate for children.      If there was a section of a store or librarie it could help keep these things out of your children, or other childrens minds. You or anyone else wouldnt have to worry about children picking certain material up that you wouldn't want them to see. Just keep this in mind next time your in a librarie and you see something you wouldn't like for your children to see.Don't you wish you had the answers, well I know..They say we're crazy..When you are suffering, know that I have betrayed you..He came dancing across the water   Cortez, Cortez   What a killer..Would you like to watch T.V.?.As a freer , as a mother, as a beautiful flower, as a wife, as a lover have me climbing up your tower..I can't sing the songs that you sing,   I can't find the gorgeous words..Let's add the harmony, let's add the harmony,   'cause if we sing together, our love will hold..She's waitin'   There I know   But for now   All I can hold   Are my memories   Of old Sata Fe.Imaginary enemy!.When I touch it, it gives forth a sound   It's got wires that vibrate and give music   What can this thing be that I found?.You were under the impression   That when you were walking forward   You'd end up further onward   But things ain't quite that simple..Maybe it was the fast paced switch up..Next time you see me!.She said..Paul rodgers      It's like a soft caressing sea   Or making love in harmony   Or the centre of a starry galaxy   It's like the richness that's inside   The one I'm trying to describe   Or the living water stretching far and wide   Searching for a shadow in the morning sun   Playing with your woman when there's work to be done   People, won't you listen when I tell the truth   I give her all my sugar, she's got such a sweet tooth yeah yeah   It's like a sound that rests my soul   Or like a part that's now a whole   Or as something that is burning bright as gold   I want her near me everyday   Then I want to hear her say   There is somthing here between us as we lay   Searching for a shadow in the morning sun   Playing with your woman when there's work to be done   People, won't you listen when I tell the truth   I give her all my sugar, she's got such a sweet tooth yeah yeah.We are the hunters,   So one by one   You know we'll find you..America, your head's too big   Because America   Your belly's too big   And I love you   I just wish you'd stay where you is      Oh...in America   The land of the free, they said   And of opportunity   In a just and a truthful way   But where the president   Is never black, female or gay   And until that day   You've got nothing to say to me   To help me believe      Oh...in America   It brought you the hamburger   Oh well America you know where   You can shove your hamburger   And don't you wonder   Why in Estonia they say   Hey you big fat pig   You fat pig, You fat pig      Steely blue eyes   With no love in them   Scan The World   And a humorless smile   With no warmth within   Greets the world   And I, I have got nothing   To offer you   No-no-no-no-no   Just this heart, deep and true   Which you say you don't need      See with your eyes   Touch with your hands, please   Hear through your ears   Know in your soul, please   For haven't you me with you now?.How can I be thankful when they start to thank the Lord?.Hey, how ya doin'?.Walk it down..When our check bounces at the store   And the whole world seems at war   You bring me peace of mind once more   With just a little love      When the boss says I'm ten minutes late   And the stack of bills just won't wait   Oh, you take the worries away   With just a little love      [Chorus]   Just a little love   And affection   You bring a touch of perfection   To a world that's sometimes crazy   And so mixed up   Just a little love   You have changed me   You make me see why the good Lord made me   And you can do miracles   With just a little love      When our old car won't run   And all my dreams come undone   You'll make it right won't ya hun   With just a little love      When it seems like all the truths are gone   When I'm trying so hard to hold on   You make it easy to be strong   With just a little love      [Chorus]"
"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @MONTH1 @CAPS3, I am a student from @CAPS4 @CAPS5 @CAPS6 @CAPS7, I do think that certain materials such as books. music, movies, magazines, etc, should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive because, some students read book on a daily basics and reading also keep some students out of trouble. The @CAPS8 I say that is because if you find a book you might be interesting in the book and you might share @CAPS2 with you youger sisters or brothers to keep them from doing the wrong things. Also some books that are offensive shows students to not do the things they see in the book. Some books that are offensive show how people that do bad thing have to pay the cost and people can learn from other people mistakes. Some books that are offensive show people what to do or what not to do so you wouldn' t have to pay that cost from doing something wrong.     Also music can be offensive because of the curseing that some of the songs have in @CAPS2.The music is sometimes good to listen to because songs speak and takes action in a certain way.The offensive part about the music is that some music is calm music and @CAPS2 keeps you motivated inside and some music have bad vibes to @CAPS2 and can make you do bad things.Most of the time music can make you happy and you can undertsand alot in life just by listening to music. Music is a description of life meaning that life is ful of offensive things but you have to be very selfcentered to understand.     Some movies can also be offensive because of the actions in the movies. Movies are enjoyable and you can also relate to some movies in your own way. At times movies can be very interesting because of the actions and drama in the movies. The titles in the movie can also be offensive but that don't mean the movie is a bad relation in the story.     Magazines can also be offensive because of the things inside of the magazine. Some magazines shows appropriate things that children and adults can relate to. Also there are different things like activitys and things for family and freinds to enjoy. Many magazines are different in there own way @CAPS2 depends on how the cover is and the person who created the magzine. Some things are good about magazines because they show you posters of some of the super stars in the music career.     There are alot of things that can be offensive in the world but you have to learn how to seperate yourself from the negative things in life. Also all things are not offensive because you can relate to some of the books and music that we here in these days. The most important thing is that you don't have to listen what the magazines and movies are telling you because, you have a mind of your own. People don't listen to what the books and etc, are going by because some of the things they are talking about is false information. So thats why i say @CAPS7 i do believe that cartain materials should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive.

"People all around the world think differently about music, books, and movies. Some think that books and music should have different kinds of ratings. Some people think that a song should be rated '@CAPS1' for mature when others could think that it shouldn't have any rating at all. Level rating stops young kids from buying something they are not mature enough for. Level ratings help the parents know what the kids are getting into.      If everyone could pull off a book or magazine, etc then there would be no books left. This is why we have levels of maturty on the material. Levels are letters, such as '@CAPS1' for mature. '@CAPS1' means that their will probably be some naked and sexual play into the video or song. With this on their it warns the parent so that if they do not want their child listening to it they can take it away. This leaves the parent with some control over what kids can watch and hear.     Stores won't let kids under the age of @NUM1 buy a rated @CAPS4 movie. Rated @CAPS4 stands for sexual act, language, and blood. It can stand for more things such as drugs. I am happy that my nine year old can't buy a rated @CAPS4 movie, but senice the law says a @NUM1 year old kid should be aloud to watch it, then its saying they should be mature enough to see or hear it.     We should be happy that we can have some control over what are children watch and listen too. We could try getting rid of all bad books, movies etc, but over time I'@CAPS1 sure more will be made. I am also sure that over time we will find a old copy of a book on a website. We cannot save our kids their whole life, so over time we have got to let them grow up. Our kids will decide if they are mature enough to watch something we would rather them not watch. We just have to raise them the best we can..Who's to say?.Oh, hold me, Jesus, I'm shakin' like a leaf   You have been king of my glory, won't you be my prince of peace?.Remember that   Laughing   Discovery   Oh how I look back and reflect   How I felt it   I was sick   I don't have to feel so wrong   Now I wake up dreaming saffron, turmeric and brass      With just the slightest bit of finesse   I might have made a little less mess   But it was what it was   Let's all get on with it   Now!.CHORUS   You know that I am ... hooked on love..My sweet ebony angel   We're going a long long way..Then twist it..Where has my love gone?.Akon, Enrique   Red One, Konvict   One day at a time      Saw you in the club   You were dancing with somebody   So close so tight   You were killing me so slowly   My friends were telling me what you're doing   Can drive a man so crazy   Trying to live my life   It's been 6 months since you left me      So I oh I oh I   Still thinking about you baby   I try I try   But I guess I gotta take it      One day at a time   I gotta let you go   One day at a time   It seems so impossible   One day at a time   I gotta let you go   And I know, yes I know   I gotta take it one day at a time      One day, one day, one day   One day at a time   One day, one day, one day   One day at a time      I am not the jealous heart   But you stole my heart baby   Dancing with that guy   Made it so hard for me to watch baby   I just been around running in circle   I'm going through it in my mind baby   Had to suck up the tears from my night strolls   To stop from crying out loud baby      Oh I oh I   Still thinking about you baby   I try I try   Can't stop thinking about you baby   Oh I oh I   I keep thinking about you baby   I try I try   But I guess I gotta take it      One day at a time   Said I gotta let you go   One day at a time   But it seems so impossible   One day at a time   Said I gotta let you go   And I know, and I know   I gotta take it one day at a time      First thing I gotta do is try to face it (try to face it)   But your voice keeps playing in my ear (playing in my ear)   It just makes me crazy trying to fake it (trying to fake it)   The true event's so bad, it's not what I wanna hear   But I guess I gotta take it      One day at a time   I gotta let you go   One day at a time   It seems so impossible   One day at a time   I gotta let you go   And I know, yes I know   I gotta take it one day at a time      One day at a time   Said I gotta let you go   One day at a time   But it seems so impossible   One day at a time   Said I gotta let you go   And I know, yes I know   I gotta take it one day at a time      One day at a time   Said I gotta let you go   One day at a time   But it seems so impossible   One day at a time   Said I gotta let you go   And I know, yes I know   I gotta take it one day at a time.When the devil made that woman   Lord, she threw the pattern away   She was built for speed with the tools   You need to make a new fool every day..You're just too used to my honey..Aaw, baby, you're close!.Don't you do no trav'lin',   Fly in no machines..Snowball fights outside..Unknown, talk to unknown   Ever, lasts forever   Well it's a shock, shock to your soft side   Summer moon   Catch your shut eyes in your room   In my room   In your room   In my room      Louder, lips speak louder   Better, back together   Still it's a shock, shock to your soft side   Summer moon   Catch your shut eyes in my room   In your room   In my room   In your room      Whats the time   Whats the day   Go and leave me   Whats the time [Repeat x2]   Whats the place   Go and leave me      Out,      Leave me out [Repeat x3].Nothing don't pay nothing, maybe see what follow on..Well his mama told him   Someday you will be a man   And you will be the leader   Of a big old band   Many people coming   From miles around   To hear you play your music   Till the sun goes down   Maybe some day   Your name will be in light   Saying Johnny B.

"'Book or no Book?' Certain studies have shown that there are many people in this world that have many diffrent intrest. Wheather that be cars, boats, toys, or animals it shouldn't matter what the intrest is. I firmly beleive that a library should have books over tons of things. Just because one person might not agree with it doesn't mean that another should not be able to read or possible learn about it.      This is a on going debate nation wide and there is going to have to be a decision made fast!! There are to many people making enimies all over the world. I was asked to submit my opinion and i beleive that they should be allowed to check out any book that they want too. If the opposite person does not agree with the fact that those books are being checked outh then they don't have to watch it.      There are multiple solutions to the problem. The librarys could have diffrent sections for diffrent types of books or such as sorting them by class or hobbies. There could also be age limits so that kids don't get ahold of anyting that they shouldn't be watching or reading.That way the other people would never even have to see the books that he or she does not agree with.      Well i cant wait to see how the results turn out!! I also hope they people make the right vote. Im not saying that my vote is the only way, its just my opinion. Either way there will be angry people and people that will be bursting with joy.

"A colossal number of significant and life-changing books can be found in the millions of libraries throughout the world. The big question is whether or not individuals should get rid of the books of lesser importance, and the books that are found offensive to a number of people. In my opinion, there are a certain number of books wasting away on the shelves of the library that need to be disposed of. That is why libraries need to discover which books are creating issues, such as books on race or religion. Although Katherine Paterson boldly argues against taking books off of the shelves, I strongly disagree and believe that libraries should remove materials that are creating tension or books wasting away on the shelves.     Race is an extremely important topic in the world today, and I believe books that discrimate against certain ethnicity's need to be removed immediately from libraries. @CAPS2, there are exceptions to this proposal. For instance, books talking about the civil war and underground railroad need to be kept in libraries because they are significant historical events. Unlike fantastic books about our nation's history, there are also books about race that are of lesser importance, and they @MONTH1 offend people. In that case, libraries need to crack down on this issue and remove offensive books from the shelves!     Secondly, libraries need to be extremely cautious about what music is made available to the public. It is important that we teach our children the difference between right and wrong at a young age, and if the kids hear some of the derogatory music on the shelves, they will lose all sense of what is right and wrong. As Katherine Paterson mentions in her quote,' All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf.' @CAPS1, that same quote can easily apply to the music on display in the libraries.  By libraries exposing children to derogatory music, they are creating enormous liabilities for the children and their families. Overall, our society would benefit greatly if libraries removed derogatory and offensive music.     Lastly, Katherine Paterson says that if we keep removing offensive books from the shelves, there will be 'no books left on the shelf for any of us.' @CAPS2, that is a nieve comment as @CAPS1 as an exaggeration. There are millions of libraries throughout the world and thousands of items in each of those libraries. Therefore, it would benefit our society if we would dispose of the items creating the greatest amount of tension, and there is one simple but effective way of doing that. When people are at the check out desk at the library, the library could have a sheet of paper asking if the customer found a certain book offensive. If the same item appears regularly on the list, remove the item. That would benefit everybody greatly because the offensive items would no longer be on the shelves, and it takes little effort from all parties involved.     In conclusion, I oppose Katherine Paterson's decision and believe libraries should remove offensive materials immediately. One highly controversial topic is race, and if the book is not informing us about a historical event, it should be removed. Certain derogatory and offensive music is available in libraries, and it should be removed from the shelves as @CAPS1. A quick and efficient way of figuring out which books are offensive is to have a list available to the public where they can write down which book they find offensive. Ultimately, libraries need to take action and dispose of the offensive materials that pose a threat to our society.Well I just washed my car   And I think it's gonna rain   I'm not gonna quiver or

"Do I believe that certain materials should be taken off book sheleves if found offensive? There are many answers to this question and many people have different views to the question. For instance, you have to look at all of the different races, customs, and more of what people believe in to find the true answer. Some materials are very offensive, but should they be taken off the shelves of our very own libraries?     There are thousands of books in a library, and hundreds are written every single year. These books range from romance, action packed, and scary. Now many books are starting to be found offensive to our society today. I have read many books and have not found hardly any book to ever be offensive. There are offensive things in other matierals such as: music, movies, and magazines.      I do recall listening to music, watching movies and reading magazines and not liking what i was doing at all. Some music today is just extremely bad. From the fowl language and missinterpretation of words, music has become worse. Some movies that I have watched are not very well either. Movies can be offensive in many other ways than any other material there is. You got the scary, gorry and the movies with all of the different sex scenes that are made every year. This can teach the younger kids what is wrong and right, as well let them be aware of what life is about.     I do believe that all of these materials should stay on the shelves of our libraries. Learning from books, music, movies, and magazines is good in a way. Knowing that many things in this world today are offensive to people, I think that it can only make our society stronger to help us understand all of the different views that our people have. Yes it can go in bad directions, but there are many ways to get people to understand what is right and what is wrong to push them to stride for the best.      Knowing that materials on our shelves are offensive, I still believe that the right thing to do is to keep them there. Clearly people get mad and upset when reading, listening, or watching these materials, but this is what makes us who we are. There will always be offensive stuff being said written and so on, but the way you can handle it yourself will show everyone around you that it is possible to change their own views of the offensive matter and look at it the better way..Bad boys, bad boys whatcha gonna do whatcha gonna do?.Screams and nightmares   Of a life I want   Can't see living this lie no   A world I haunt   You've lost all

"Censorship has become a major part of the media now-a-days. It is everywhere: books, movies, songs, and television shows. The government is trying to make the children of @DATE1 less corrupt, but they will end up learning everything that is censored for their friends and peers anyways. I feel censorship is a waste of time for the government. Children learn mature information sooner than they should in @DATE1's society.     Censorship should be more for the media children and young teens pay attention to. It should not be put into more mature movies and music, such as movies with adult content and rap. Those are more of items for grown up and teenagers than for children. If parents allow their children to listen to and watch that certain media, then they must feel their children are mature enough and know enough to not be majorly effected by it. Censorship also ruins the quality of books, music, and movies.     Certain words help to better express people and their views. If they can not use the specific word they feel describes them the best, it tends to ruin the quality of their character. People cannot be themselves when they have to watch what they say and are looked down upon because of their choice of language. I, myself, am very free with my language and the inappropriate and vulgar things I say. They are just a part of my nature and help me to be more expressive of myself. There are probably better, more appropriate words to use when I am in public, but then I would not feel like I am being quite myself. I think censorship is corrupting our society.     The government is trying to control us with censorship. I am not one of those paranoid people that thinks the government is out to get them. This just happens to be one of my opinions of censorship. We should get rid of it. It is changing the way people are and the way they feel they can act around others. People have to be careful of what they say, and I feel that makes speaking and attempting to express yourself so much more challenging. Censorship should be stopped before it ruins the quality of all the media..In the moment you come before me,   In that moment I see you only   Isobella, oh!.Hello cowgirl in the sand   Is this place at your command?.Yeah she likes to run   With us high riding cowboys   She says she feels a whole lot   More at home on the range   She can handle her feelings   In most all situations   She just can

My clock goes ticking through the night   Counting the seconds I don't sleep   I wish that I could turn back time   But some things were never meant to keep   Was it just another love affair?.So hard to cross that line,   That holds us to the right time..But over in a land that's in my back yard   There's a people who succeed, they don't try hard      Well, they found a way to live with ease   By eating from the bush instead of the trees      Apple bush, apple tree   Path to eternity   Find you a path and you follow the call      Apple bush, apple tree   Back to eternity   Cut you a path with a chance you may fall      Well, over in a corner, standing there   Telling my house that they haven't a single care      But my house does not listen (worry) it's got a path of it's own   Yet the bush, and a tree, never leave it alone      Apple Bush, apple tree   Back to eternity   Find you a path and you buy with a call      Apple bush, apple tree   Back to eternity   Cut you a path with a chance you may fall      Someday like my house you're going to chose too   If you cut this new path well the old one will do   and you live with the people who live with ease   The red apple bush, the blue apple tree.Had to think I had heaven right here in my hand   And oh, just let it slip away like sand..I'll get through some day..What do you want?.The words mean, I am a truthful man   From the land of the palm trees   And before dying, I want to share the poems of my soul   My poems are soft green,   My poems are also flaming crimson   My poems are like a wounded fawn   Seeking refuge in the forest   The last verse says ""con los pobres de la tierra""   With the poor people of this earth   I want to share my fate   The streams of the mountain   Pleases me more than the sea.[Dial tone]

love is, love is hard to find   It's suddenly a game   And you won this heart of mine      [Bridge]   I never believe it   After all that I've been through   So good to receive it   All alone that I

you see it   Love is burning out   And I just have to say   That's the way it's turning now   Well it's plain to see   Baby, what you do to me   What used to be a dream   Is now everything that's on me, yeah      [Bridge      [Chorus: x 2]      (Moving on) moving on baby   (Moving on) moving on   (Looking on) looking on baby   (Looking on) looking on      [Bridge]      [Chorus: x 4].Have you had too much of my love?.The city streets are full of people going nowhere making time   The change from night to day is really only hours   It's just along the line, can't you see the sign?.Advice is cheap you can take it from me   It's your's to keep cause opinions are free   Nobody knows about the trouble I've seen   Nobody's perfect, mister, nobody's clean   It coasts too much and takes too long to find out too late   Some words aren't heard 'til after they're spoken   Your role was protective, your soul was too defective   Some people just don't have a heart to be broken      We could've gone all the way to the Great Wall of China   If you only had a little more faith in me   In lieu of diamonds, gold, and platinum   reminders will still shine bright   All the king's men and all the king's horse   Can't put you together the way you used to be   We could have been standing on the Great Wall Of China      You take a piece of whatever you touch   Too many pieces means you're touching too much   You never win if you can't play it straight   You only beat me if you get me to hate   It must be so lonely to think that you have only   Somebody elses life to live if they let you   I ain't too selective, but it don't take no detective   To find out how fast your friends will forget you      We could have gone all the way to the Great Wall of China   Now all you're going to be is history   Help yourself, it's all you can eat at the Empire Diner tonight   You coulda had class, you coulda been a contender   Charlie, you shoulda looked out for me   You could have been standing, standing on the Great Wall of China      This was not your calling, just look how far you've fallen   I heard your story, man, you've got to be joking   Keep things in perspective, this is my true objective   Why tear this heart out if it's only been broken?"

"How would you feel if you were forced to only enjoy the exact things that everyone else enjoys? If you were limited to only certain subjects because all of the other choices were thrown out you might begin to feel trapped. Everyone in this world is different from the next person. So I believe that each person should be able to read any book they would like without any restrictions. Some reasons for my opinion are personal values, unique interests, and the fact that people should have a right to read the books that they like without judgement from others.     For my first reason goes along with personal values. For example a person of higher authority @MONTH1 find a particular book, magazine, or movie inappropriate due to their values and beliefs. So if this person is the owner of the library they would be able to throw out all books and movies pertaining to that topic. This would make it unfair for the people who do enjoy these topics.      My next reason is that every single person has their own unique interests. If someone begins to dispose of books that they are not interested in the library will lose all of the visitors that do find that topic enjoyable. This can cause the library problems and be a disappointment to those who find reading about that certain topic a great way to pass time. Everyone likes different things and has different views. They should not be forced to read only the things that are selected by another person.     People should also have a right to read the books that they like without judgement from others. I know from experience that being ostracized for doing what you enjoy is completely unfair. If everyone did the things that every other person does our world would not accomplish anything out of the ordinary. Many people find inspiration from books and movies so if these were limited to only particular subjects people would begin to feel pressured to be the same. Every person should have a right to enjoy the things that make them happy without being hurt by the opinions and judgements of others.     Books should be something that each person should have a choice in. If there are endless choices of books and movies a person could learn about many different things and develope a more open mind. If everyone in this world opened their mind people would become more accepting of others. So I believe anything that is published should be there for the public to read. No one should be limited because of other people's values or interest. The right to read the books, magazines, and watch the movies you like should always be present..(yeah)   You'll tell your girlfriends, won't ya?.So many 25th's of December   Just as many 4th of July's   And we're still holding it together   It only comes down to you and I      I know you can still remember   Things we said right from the start   When we said that this could be special   I'm keeping those words deep down in my heart      Another year has gone by   And I'm still the one by your side   After everything that's gone by   There's still no one saying goodbye   Though another year has gone by      I never been much for occasions   You never let another birthday go by   Without announcing how much you love me   But the truth was always there   Right there in your eyes      And we're still holding hands when we're walking   Acting like we've only just met   But how can that be - when there's so much history   I guess that's how true lovers can get      Another year has gone by   And I'm still the one by your side   After everything that's gone by   There's still no one saying goodbye   Though another year has gone by      Another year has gone by   And I'm still the one by your side   After everything that's gone by   There's still no one saying goodbye   Though another year has gone by.[Intro: J.

"Should we remove books and media because they are offensive? I do not believe so. In this essay I will describe to you why I think this way.      The word offensive is a contreversial word. Is it kissing that makes books and media offensive or is it curse words or fighting. Many people see many different things.      Many off the books today's youth read are 'offensive' to older generations. That is because today's standerds are different. Children are more free to do what they want and say what they want, making offensive a changed word.     If a book, song, or video is offensive then the parents should take that up with their children. Things that are offensive for some people are just fine for other people. Just because it is out there does not mean that we have to see it.      So in conclusion I do not think that books and media should be removed from the shelf for being offensive, because offensive is a changing word and it is different for every person..I guess there's nothin' more funky king can do   But to try to get next to you..Girl come kiss come hug me!.Without you I can't make my way,   I surrender, dear..Darlin', I'm feeling pretty lonesome   I'd call you on the phone some   But I don't have dime   Darlin', you're so far behind me   Tomorrow is gonna find me   Further down the line   Take a piece of paper   A pencil in my hand   I'm gonna write   Darlin', I know I feel the cold nights   Thinking of the old nights   Spent alone with you   Darlin', tears are in my eyes now   Know that I should try now   To make it back to you   Darlin', I love you more than ever   I wish we were together   Darlin' mine   Darlin', I'm feeling pretty lonesome   I'd call you on the phone some   But I don't have a dime   Darlin', you're so far behind me   Tomorrow's gonna find me   Further down the line   Darlin', tears are in my eyes (oh, in my eyes)   You that I should try now (I should try to make it back to you)   To make it back to you.All summer long you smelled like lotion and we made love when we took the notion   Summer is gone and it's hard to believe how lonely I am raking up leaves   Raking up leaves and counting the days   Yes and counting the nights that you've been away   The winter winds blow and memories freeze   I'm missing you and raking up leaves   [ sax ]   Expecting the sun just any day now wish you were here to go out and play now   You say you'll return when they're on the trees   I'm hungry for you and raking up leaves   Raking up leaves and counting the days....Don't you remember me..Nigga make it ruff!.It's a modern life   But it's not what you're looking for..Falling and spinning   Losing and winning   Keeping my head   Watching for signals   Wearisome vigil   Was I misled   I remember you said   That you don't want to forget me   It doesn't matter   Which of our fantasies fled..Down the dead end street, he strikes to kill the weed..There are higher heights, there are deeper seas,   Whatever you need to do, Lord do in me..(...

"In my personal opinion, I do believe that certain materials whether it be in books, music, magazines, or movies be romoved or edited more carefully. Most parents, including mine, expect their kids to behave with manners and not use foul language or make out with their boyfriend or girlfriend in inappropriate times, and yet we promote it and that's unacceptable.      In bookstores or even libraries, they have some books on the shelves that can be considered inappropriate. We encourage and even push kids to read, but we can't even say, pick any book you want. These books @MONTH1 have foul language, gang violence, or even sexual jestures that I wouldn't even consider giving to a niece or a baby cousin.      There are many types of music out in the real world. Everyone has their favorite music and they have their least favorite. In my opinion, you can't make everyone happy so your just going to have to ignore it. There are different cd's, cassate tapes, or even records, that you can buy. Yes, I think what some people put in their music is not appropriate but we can always change the station on the radio. You don't have to purchase that cd, and you can always ride with no music on.      Magazines can get pretty ugly sometimes. Whether it's @PERSON1 on the front page with no hair, or @LOCATION1's next top model. Quite frankly, I don't mind seeing that in magazines but strict parents @MONTH1 not want their kids being exposed to @NUM1 actions. Magazines could talk about anything such as someone on drugs, alcohol, or winning the lottory. You just have to choose what you and your kids look at wisely.      People can get pretty crazy on what they do and how they do it. Whether it be in writing, singing, or pictures, you know there is always someone going to do something inappropriate.

"Censorship in libraries!Do you believe that certianmaterials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive?NO!, I do not think they should be removed. I believe everyone is intitled to there own opinion, @CAPS1 if something is offensiv eto one person @CAPS2 @MONTH1 not be to another. No one thinks the same or has the same opinion about somethings thats why there is a variety of books, music, movies etc. If you take out the 'offensive' things, @CAPS2 @MONTH1 cause offense to another.People just need to stop being sefish and understand everyone is different and we all have different interests.Make it mine!.Did you dream about it?.Sorry about that, Russel..Before you have your buttered toast, have a song..Mother do you think she's good enough, for me?.Like a drifter in the dark   Seeking out what isn't there   Looking only for a spark      From a girl who's all alone   Maybe she's a-driftin' too   Like a shadow in the night   Waitin' just to meet with you      And then perhaps in love you'll stay   Or fall and go your separate ways   Still searchin' for a spark   Like a drifter in the dark      [Repeat: x8]   Doodn doo doo doodn doo (da da da da da)      Do you ever walk alone?.It's none of my business   But if I may   Remind you of the time   When you did something you knew was wrong   It wasn't called a crime   And I'm not saying that you should give   A sucker an even break   I'm talking about the time   That you were cruel for cruelty's sake   I'm talking about the time   That you were cruel for cruelty's sake      [Chorus]   How you gonna pay for   How you gonna pay for   How you gonna pay for the sin?.(What have I, what have I, what have I done to deserve this?).Took a ride when I should'a walked,   Got there way to fast..Learn the pachuco hop, and let me twirl you!.Well, I know what a fool I was   To think that you could love me, too..Was there fire engine red that she left upon your cheek?.So what the fuck is with you..Whoa, whoa, I'm radioactive, radioactive..Somebody tells me that you've been taken off the air..Love is everywhere..Stop everything!.When you smile, I can tell, we know each other,   very well..You won't believe all of the things that she put me through..And his tiny room!.Happy birthday, happy birthday, happy birthday (woo, shake!).You're gonna lose your head, my friend   Literally!"
"I do not believe that any material should be removed from library shelves.  I stand frmly with this because it is a choice to read material that is found offensive.  I would not expect a young child to seek out inappropiate materials because they are not interested in them.  Just as I would not expect an adult to go searching for a little kid book.  Basically there is a maturity barrier that seperates what each age level is interested in reading.     There is no point in removing any material from libraries because you would accomplish nothing.  People who would get offended mainly children are already exposed to violent videogames which glorify war and violence.  And you can not just go ahead and remove material that you think is offensive.     If you removed offensive material from libraries then I guess you would have to shut down the internet as well.  A child could much more easily go to a computer and find anything offensive they want to find with the click of a button.  Also at a library their are age level restrictions on cards that prevent a child from checking out offensive material.     Some people might enjoy material that is offensive.  If material is removed  alot of people would be upset that libraries do not carry what they wanted.  There would be alot of complaints, and problems.  And some people might stop going to the library because the content was limited..     The best thing to do is allow libraries to have whatever material they want to have.  Many people will be satasified, and most people will be happy.I see my baby   I get week in my knees..c'mon!"".Illinois, I'm your boy..Cause I'm right good of holding on to secrets   And don't believe they show..Though i know that evenin's empire has returned into sand,   Vanished from my hand,   Left me blindly here to stand but still not sleeping..Guard well the secret of steel..Used to always stay at home, be a good girl..Without question..Listen to the blackbird sadly sing   For you, for me   Look at all the pointless suffering   Humanity   I am dreaming of a garden   And I see the midnight flight   Of a blackbird, through my vision   To the light   To the light   She is standing in the doorway   With the love light in her eye   And she beckons me to journey   Through the night   Through the night   Listen to the blackbird sadly sing   For you, for me   Look at all the pointless suffering   Humanity   To the people, who are naked   As they breathe in amber haze   Wandering endlessly narcotic   Through the maze   Through the maze   To the leaders, who are timeless   As they flaunt their warlike ways   Flying endlessly o'er the wasteland   Seeking praise   Seeking praise   Listen to the blackbird sadly sing   For you, for me   Look at all the pointless suffering   Humanity.Oh, why don'tcha      Shake your kitty   Shake your kitty (meow)   Put your arms around me, babe   I'm giving you permission to feel me      Shake your kitty   Shake your kitty (meow)   Put your arms around me, babe   I'm giving you permission to feel me      You'll never call me by my name   But I still want you   You play some pretty tricky games   But I still want you   Your best friend drives a fancy car   But I still want you   You're working every hour   But, but I still want you yeah!.Who can say where she may hide   Must I travel far and wide   'til I am beside   That someone who   I can mean something to?.Look up, look down   Gotta find me a hole to hide my head in the ground   Look up, look down   Gettin' tired of my woman runnin' around      Everybody says give her a second chance   But that'll be the seventy-second time in advance   Look up, look down   Gotta get to the ground      Look up, look down   Watch the whole wide world spinnin' around   Look up, look down   Baby find my woman runnin' around      Everybody says give her a second chance   But that'll be the seventy-second time in advance   Look up, look down   Gotta get to the ground      Ra da da da da ....

"Have you ever felt as though your reading choices are dwindeling? Censorship is taking away our freedom to experince to read or listen to what we want, who has the right to tell us what we can watch, read or even listen to?     As an avid reader of all kinds of literature i cant stand censorship. Kids today need to be able to read what they want, to open up their minds to new ideas and ways of life. The so called 'banned' books are some of the best anyone can read, as @CAPS1 we should be able to read what we want, wether it is offensive or not.     If you want to put certain restictions on a book such as a age limit i can understad that, but to completely take them off the shelves then we are losing our greatest right as an @CAPS2 citisen. To read and watch or listen other media is a great way to learn about things other than what is in our back yard.     Music and television i understand some censorship, i dont want my little brother or any younger youth hearing the '@CAPS3 bomb' or seeing anythin obsene, but these days its getting harder and harder to control what they watch or listen to seeing how it's so easy to obtain those sources of media.      Many kids today have access to the enternet which can be good and bad. If a parent does not want their kids watching or listening to anything obscene then they have the right to but certain blocks on their computer. Kisd these days mainly use two kinds of media which are the enternet and @CAPS4, but a kid who wants to read should have as many choices as possible weather it be fiction, classics such as 'The @CAPS5 snd The @CAPS6', or educational litterature.     So is our reading choices becoming scarese? Yes i believe so, na it all has to do with censorship. We cant read some of the classics because the're 'racist' or are 'pornagraphic', but you have to understand for the time they were written the weren't. so let everyone read what they want when they want..I need me..Go and tell Lord Grenville that the tide is on the turn   It's time to haul the anchor up and leave the land astern   We'll be gone before the dawn returns   Like voices onthe

"'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf.  But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf-that work I abhor-then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else.  And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.'  @CAPS1 many people believe that certain books should be banned from schools, just the opposite is true as students can learn valuable life lessons from these books, get a deeper understanding of the past, and comprehend the true meaning of an author's unique style.     Over the years many well-written books have been on a 'censored list', meaning that they are at a risk of being removed from the library.  'The @CAPS2 of @ORGANIZATION1', '@ORGANIZATION2 @ORGANIZATION2', and '@CAPS3 to @ORGANIZATION3' are all examples of books that have been marked down as being offensive.  These books are all written in a style of their own and can bring a different lesson to every reader.  While one reader @MONTH1 love the story and wear out the pages, another @MONTH1 get halfway through and never finish it.  However, the belief that there is freedom of choice in reading is correct.     'The @CAPS2 of @ORGANIZATION1' by @PERSON1 is a classic example of a censored book.  Throughout the book there is foul language used that is considered offensive to some.  However, at the period of time the book was written, these words were not considered to be wrong.  Books like this should be saved for older generations to read; however, we also have to realize that if a parent allows their children to read that book at a young age, there is nothing that can be done about it.  None-the-less, removing the book from the library is not the correct response.     Ever heard the saying 'learn from past mistakes'?  Books are a fantastic way to learn about the past in a fun and enjoyable way.  They are a tool of knowledge.  Removing a book from a library is like removing hundreds of pages of knowledge.  Every story has a unique style, which @MONTH1 appeal to some and not to others.  Many books give readers a deeper understanding of what the time period was like when the book was written.     '@ORGANIZATION2' has been a known censored book from the beginning due to its somewhat dark and gloomy aspects at certain points throughout the story.  How many kids do we see at school carrying around one of the '@ORGANIZATION2 @ORGANIZATION2' books?  They often state that it is their favorite book of all time.  If the book were to be removed from the library, it would cause many students to never have the opportunity to read a fantastically written book, which has a unique style about it.     Throughout our twelve years of school, students are taught to think for themselves and make their own decisions.  How are we encouraging this if we are removing materials from their grasp?  If we cannot let students make such a simple decision as to whether or not to read a book, we are teaching poor life lessons..Are you coming to get me now?.Some folks called me a dreamer   Other folks left and called me a fool   All I ever wanted to be was a winner   'cos I know a winner can never lose..We are rotting      We're going down   In a spiral to the ground   No one, No one's gonna save us now      Not even God   No one saved us   No one's gonna save us      Where do you expect us to go when the bombs fall?.Tell you from the word ""go,""   Destined to deceive her..In... the dark..You yourself set me on this course when I was a child,   Walking down these men streets like a boy gone wild,   Programmed for survival..Now the darkness comes   And I'll pray for   The end of us all..Blue sky, devil eye   Cyanide, suicide   Double down, let it ride   Lose your money   Bruise your pride   Easy come, easy went   Ghetto slums tenements   Things look real, Old Testament   Blame it all on the president      [Chorus:]   The emperor's got brand new clothes   And everybody but him knows he's naked   But you don't say a word   The emperor's got brand new jewels   Wake up soon you silly fools   He's naked   But you don't say a word   The rich they get richer   The poor they get poorer   While liberty stands naked screaming in horror   The emperor raped her but we just ignore her   The rich they get richer   The poor they get poorer      Euthanize, youth will rise   Scrutinize, truth from lies   Time to revolutionize   Organize, weaponize   Easy come, easy go   Think I'm movin' just a little bit too slow   Got front row tickets to the big freak show   Wait for the whole freakin' thing to blow      [Chorus:]      Homicide, genocide   Victimize, paralyze   Empathize and analyze   Compromise and vandalize   Easy come, hard to take   Wide awake the original fake   Find the heart, drive the stake   Wait for the whole freakin' thing to break      [Chorus:].Well..Well, I hear mariachi static on my radio   And the tubes they glow in the dark   And I'm there with her in Ensenada   And I'm here in Echo Park      Carmelita, hold me tighter   I think I'm sinking down...

"Books movies and music should not be removed from the shelves. For many of years people would come to the libaray for them. some  @MONTH1 be volger as well as they @MONTH1 be offensive, but there should be a age check out law. as well as being with in consideration for this centerys ways.     There are many people who thribe off of the horrable thing people put out in to the world. They love to pain of others. Instead of taking the offensive work off the shelves, there should be a age limmit to what sertan age groupes should read. Yees there are young kids who are reading this kind of things, but that lyes with the parents.           If there was a age limmit of what people should be able to read then that would solve the problem.As well we could have the parents sign out the book saying it is okay for their child to read such a book.      if we  had all of this then there would not be any more problems. it would be a nice controled libaray. so in conclustion this is the way to go. this is the futur of tommorw.Boo-ba-doo-ba-doop!.[Verse 1: Niall Horan]   Counted all my mistakes and there's only one   Standing out from the list of the things I've done   All the rest of my crimes don't come close   To the look on your face when I let you go   So I built you a house from a broken home   And I wrote you a song with the words you spoke   It took me some time but I figured out   How to fix up a heart that I let down      [Chorus:]   Now I'm searching every lonely place   Every corner calling out your name   Tryin to find you but I just don't know   Where do broken hearts go?.Just call it anything!.Can you feel it?.Nobody knows the trouble I've seen   Nobody knows but Jesus   Nobody knows the trouble I've seen   Glory, Hallelujah      Sometimes I'm up   And sometimes I'm down   Yes, Lord, you know sometimes I'm almost to the ground   Oh, yes, Lord, still      Nobody knows the trouble I've seen   Nobody knows but Jesus   Nobody knows the trouble I've seen   Glory, Hallelujah      If you get there before I do   Oh, yes, Lord, don't forget to   Tell all my friends I'm coming too   Oh, yes, Lord, still      Nobody knows the trouble I've seen   Nobody knows but Jesus   Nobody knows the trouble I've seen   Glory, Hallelujah      Although you see me   Goin' on so, oh, yes   I have my trials here below   Oh, yes, Lord.Bewitched, bothered and bewildered, am I.

"There is alot of different thing that can offensive to all sorts of  people . so if we started taking thing off tv or out of book ,and magazines we would be always takeing stuff out. if it to graphic for kids put it in the adults area. would censorship be the awnser to take out  stuff no. we need to be more aware of where ur children are an there would be less probblem.     If we made the change the age limited on movie we might be even better off . If parent were to watch the movie then the parent would be able to tell them what ok an what not. we need to put more true history stuff in them an make them where you want to watch them we could be teaching kids more stuff so they know.the music should be censorship some what like with rap. there is alot of rap music that should be cleaned up so little kid dont hear it.      There might even be a better way to controll this stuff so little kids cant get a hold of it. We can have teacher help tell the kids an let them no that it not right for them to watch that. we also need to look at some of the new cartoons that are on tv. There are some that need to be clean up. There are also lot of different in what people want. Then there some that dont care about it to. Maybe someday we will figure it out and be able to do it.Untie your beans, uncage your tomatoes   Let potted plants free, don't mash that potato!.It wasn't the same, now it goes to show,   Sometime you never can tell..Here you are now   Fresh from your war   Back from the edge of time   And all that you were   Stripped to the bone   I thought you' d want to know      That when you feel the world is crashing   All around your feet   Come running headlong into my arms   Breathless   I'll never judge you   I can only love you   Come now running headlong   Into my arms   Breathless      Lay down your guns   Too weak to run   Nothing can harm you here   Your precious heart   Broken and scarred   Somehow you made it through   I only ask that you won't go again      When you feel the world is crashing   All around your feet   Come running headlong into my arms   Breathless   I'll never judge you   I can only love you   Come now running headlong   Into my arms   Breathless      I'm so glad to see you smiling   So good to hear your laugh   I think that you've found you even   Missed yourself   I'm only asking this because I think that   Truth be told   Oh, you'll never go again   Again      When you feel the world is crashing   All around your feet   Come running headlong into my arms   Breathless   I'll never judge you   I can only love you   Come now running headlong   Into my arms   Breathless   Breathless   So when you feel the world is crashing down   I want you come run into my arms.I need a C-O-O-L are-I-D-E-are..That's the good old sunny south..You and everyone today..You got me worn out trying   (Ooh, baby blue)   (What can I do?).Send me love,   Such sweet love..Scars on my fingers, bruises my neck   Crashin' my trains, warship my wreck   warship my wreck!.Hey Mambo, Mambo Italiano!.Wollt Ihr das Bett in Flammen sehen   Wollt Ihr in Haut und Haaren untergehen   Ihr wollt doch auch den Dolch ins Laken stecken   Ihr wollt doch auch das Blut vom Degen lecken   Rammstein   Ihr seht die Kreuze auf dem Kissen   Ihr meint euch darf die Unschuld kussen   Ihr glaubt zu toten ware schwer   Doch wo kommen all die Toten her   Rammstein   Sex ist eine Schlacht   Liebe ist Krieg   Wollt Ihr das Bett in Flammen sehen   Wollt Ihr in Haut und Haaren untergehen   Ihr wollt doch auch den Dolch ins Laken stecken   Ihr wollt doch auch das Blut vom Degen lecken   Rammstein.Where your heart wants to play   And your feet want to dance,   Where the close of each day   Brings a night of romance..No wasted   No wanting the can't have   Untasted   Seems everything I have      Yeah ready   Heard everything you said   I'm steady   Even though it's half past dead      Welcome to the unforgiving   Franernity of pain where   The lines remains uncrossed   Are entertained      Greetings from the other side   Where all has gone array here   But in all honesty takes me away   There      See your new Jerusalem   In saturated red   Commencement of the requiem   Begins at half past dead   Half past dead      Welcome to the humiliating   Theater insane where   Our daily theme   Is always inhumane here   Rebuild your shattered castles   From ashes to the sky   Pick-up your fallen icons   Where they lie,   There      See your new Jerusalem   In saturated red   Commencement of the requiem   Begins at half past dead   Half past dead      All eyes front and looking toward the sky   Better then I do   One step up if you're not afraid to die   Better then you do      Violent movement spawns brutality   Better then I do   Charging out into infinity   Better then you do      Peace comes to the war inside my head   Better then I do   Peace comes late, the clock strikes   Half past dead.(Extend fingers, one at a time)      Once I saw an anthill   (Hold fisted left hand outward.).(Woah-oh, it's a modern life.).Considering   So many folks, dissatisfied with everything,   Who need someone to understand they're lonely, they're lonely,   And they're not alone..I can call, wish you well,   And try to change this..Je t'en prie,   Je t'en prie,   Je t'en prie,   Je t'en prie,   Je t'en prie,   Je t'en prie--   Ne t'enfuis   Pas!.Yeah!.And I'm here to free you   And I'm here to free you   Verse 3   I'm protected by the leaves of a four leaf clover   And I, I never lie for you   And I, expect to die for my life won't live much longer   And I, I never lie for you   And I'm here to free you   And I'm here to free you   To free you   And I'm here to free you   And I'm here to free you.Yea!.The biggest trick   The biggest trick they play on you   To make you think   The show won't go on without you      We go in boxes   We go in boxes   Wooden boss   We go in boxes   We go in boxes   Wooden boxes      Now the room has been emptied   I'm alone in my bed   The heart is a box   Which the soul has fled   The spell has been broken   And the last word is said"
"A library is a public place for all ages. They have many different kinds of books for specific reasons. For the children they have a nice comfy spot for them to pick a book and sit down and read it. For adults they have coffe tables, sofa seats, and many different things while they read their books. never should a library have to disclousre certain materials because of the ages that come in and out.              Censoring a library would not make it any easier to keep young children away from certain materials that are offensive. I feel that when a child is in a library they should go to their specific areas for which they came for, they should also be monitored while in the library. Most kids woldn't go to a book that doesn't have a lot of pictures or colors in it any way. The library is a public place and is made for all ages, even though there are book stores that sell just adult books, movies, and magazines, they still shouldn't throw them out of a library. There should be equal rights all over, yes even in libraries.     The world is full of offensive things period. Now while a child a is not within a library they could be at home or in a public place and see things that they could also see in a book at the library. The removal of certain books, movies, and magazines wouldn't really stop anything. I think that if the parents teach thier children right from wrong there is nothing wrong with them being in a library that has adult books, movies, and magazines. If I owned a library I personally would not mind all kinds of books that are appropriate to a certain exstint in my selction of books. I have been to plenty of libraries and have seen stuff that I thought shouldn't be in thier but at the same I was not in my right section or doing what I was supposed to be doing. This subject really doesn't bother me, so no I don't think they should remover certain books just because children are in the library..Well, if you want an assen-ell,   The government will wish you well,   And if you steal a million bucks,   The government will wish you luck..Will you make us laugh, will you make us cry?.But nowadays in other ways   Sweet maids are one encaptured   You'll hear the best authorities declaring   Learn to croon   Ya da da dee da da da da   La da da da dee da da da   La da da da dee   Just murmur da da dee da da da dee   And when you do   She answer da da dee da da dee dee   And nestle closer to you   Learn to croon   You'll eliminate each rival soon   If you're heading for a sunny honeymoon   Learn to croon.There's Frank James and Jesse James   Billy the Kid and all the rest   Supposed to be some bad cats   Way out in the West      If those cats could of dug me   And my gangster ways   They would have hung up their guns   And dug into their graves      Cause I'm a gangster   A gangster of love   I'm a gangster   A gangster of love   Now look here   When I go into a bar   Girls from near and far   Say I'm a gangster   A gangster of love      I jumped in my white horse Cadillac   I rode across the border line   I roped 55 girls   I kissed them all the same time      Took 25 or 30, put 'em all on a freight   There was a million dollar reward for me in each and every state   Sheriff says is your name Stevie ""Guitar"" Miller in a very deep voice   And I said yes sir brother sheriff, and that's your wife on the back of my horse      I can't help it   I'm a gangster   I can't help it   You know, I'm a gangster.You got soul....

"I do not feel these types of things should not be taken off the shelves.What i think is that thing should come with a rateing because  this is a free country and for some one to do something like that it would be takeing away someone's freedom of speach.To many people have faught in the past for just simply freedom of speach.I think that if people rate the  thing's  that come out then they will not go in to the wrong hands. That's like saying they should have taken @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 when it first came out off the market because it has violance in it ,profange language,and guns that company will had lost a lot of money because it is inapprotive for kids.I think that parent's shouldn't go buy a @NUM1 or @NUM2 years old something like that but some parents do .It not the creaters fault of the actions of how people react to what ever is put out there because the buyers have to be more responseable and make sure that what ever it is is supervised and carefully montoired. There's an old saying ' every thing isn't made for every body' .I strongly belive that;That saying is so true .Every body don't like the same thing that some one eles likes but its okay for that person but it's not okay for you because as they say everything isn't for every body and you can't fource nothing on some one.Well every thing isn't approtive  for every one we all have are limites to every thing and if you watch what kids watch and do than things want be so inapprotive for this wold . Certion books young children should not read because they have sex in them and they talk about things that a child should not even be thinking about at that age.When children read books like that they tend to think about sex and how what they read about will feel but children should not be thinking about that type of stuff that why its there parent's responseabitly to montoir what there children read because that there job as parent's to do not the person who wrote the book because they @MONTH1 think there writing to a much older group that can relate to what there talking about but then again there just speacking there mind and infourceing there freedom of speach right one of the rights that we as a people together have been fighting for .I also feel that music help's us to express are selfs so if someone feels that the music is inapprotive for there child then they need to watch what there child is listen to.Music brings out the different moods in every body.All magazines are not for every one because as we all know there are adult magazines the produce certion imagary that children should not see but you can not blame the creater only the buyer is in fault for leaving it in the wrong place after there done with it .There just people trying to make money  off things that they know that people like..When we were together   Everything was so grand   Now that we're parted   There's one sound   That I just can't stand      I can't stand the rain   Against my window   Bringing back sweet memories   I can't stand the rain.[Verse 1]   Angin tolonglah aku sedang jatuh cinta

"Katherine Paterson, who is an author, thought that if a book was not one that she would want her children to read that it should be taken off the shelf at the library. If you found a book in your public library offensive, would you want that book removed from your sight and public view? Personally, I wouldn't. I would not want the book to be removed because that book could be a good learning experience for others. In this essay, I will explain from my personal experience @CAPS5 I disagree with Katherine Paterson.     In the sixth grade, I learned about how to find a certain book in a public library using a system. We had to find certain books in our school library, using this system, as an assignment. One of the books we had to find was the @CAPS1 @CAPS2. I found it very easily because I knew where it should have been and what it looks like. But there was a child in my class who had never seen a @CAPS2 in her life. After helping her find the @CAPS2, she ask, '@CAPS5 is this book so important to people? I don't understand it.' I explained to her in the best of my ability the life of @CAPS6 and @CAPS5 this was important to me. She soon found out that it was something she wanted to learn more about.     It is against the law in some states that a @CAPS2 be in school at all. This is because of others beliefs or non-beliefs. If it were not for the library having the @CAPS2 on a shelf that girl would never have learned something that is now important to her. A book can be offensive to other people but that book can change a person's life forever. Katherine Paterson believed that some books should not be found in libraries. Unfortunatley, other people think this also. One book can change a person's life, what if that book was not in the library to change another?.I die hopeless, despairing, and never before   Have I loved life like this!.Baby, you left a hurtin' only your love can heal   And I understand that's how I made you feel   Well, my life without you would just fall apart   Right from the body come my lonely heart..When I wake up in the morning, love   And the sunlight hurts my eyes   And something strange without a warning, love   Bears heavy on my mind      [Chorus]   Then I look at you   And the world is all right with me   Just one look at you   And I know it's gonna be   A lovely day   lovely day, lovely day, lovely day      When the day that lies ahead of me   Seems impossible to face   When somebody else instead of me   Always seems to know the way      [Chorus]      It's gonna be a lovely day (it's gonna be)   It's gonna be today   It's gonna be a lovely day   Today I love the world and I love you      [Chorus]      It's gonna be today   A lovely day today   It's gonna be today   A lovely day today.I will give thanks to the lord   With all my heart   I will tell of all thy wonders   I will be glad and exult in thee      I will

maybe Memphis, maybe Mexico..Come on..She told me you can try   But it's impossible to find her..In the calling out to one another   Of the lovers up and down the strand   In the sound of the waves and the cries   Of the seagulls circling the sand   In the fragments of the songs   Carried down the wind from some radio   In the murmuring of the city in the distance   Ominous and low      I hear the sound of the world where we played   And the far too simple beauty   Of the promises we made      If you ever need holding   Call my name, Ill be there   If you ever need holding   And no holding back, Ill see you through   Sky blue and black      Where the touch of the lover ends   And the soul of the friend begins   Theres a need to be separate and a need to be one   And a struggle neither wins   Where you gave me the world I was in   And a place I could make a stand   I could never see how you doubted me   When Id let go of your hand      Yeah, and I was much younger then   And I must have thought that I would know   If things were going to end      And the heavens were rolling   Like a wheel on a track   And our sky was unfolding   And itll never fold back   Sky blue and black      And Id have fought the world for you   If I thought that you wanted me to   Or put aside what was true or untrue   If Id known thats what you needed   What you needed me to do      But the moment has passed by me now   To have put away my pride   And just come through for you somehow      If you ever need holding   Call my name, Ill be there   If you ever need holding   And no holding back, Ill see you through      Youre the color of the sky   Reflected in each store-front window pane   Youre the whispering and the sighing   Of my tires in the rain   Youre the hidden cost and the thing thats lost   In everything I do   Yeah and Ill never stop looking for you   In the sunlight and the shadows   And the faces on the avenue   Thats the way love is   Thats the way love is   Thats the way love is   Sky blue and black.Yo I want to get high   I want to get high      Walking through campus with my backpack   Bailin' to orientation   So I can change the nation   See many faces but none of 'em

"Whose to say what is appropriate for whom? whose to judge right and wrong for anyone? It depends on a point of view like most things. The sheltered must learn one day, and if kids learn now about the truth, such as, not to stick forks in outlets, then they won't be as curious when they are older. Being sheltered is not always a good thing and censor ship of what we read, watch, or listen to is ridculous, and disrespectful to authors.          In matters of censorship, I find it to be pointless. Censorship doesn't prevent your kids from learning about anything, except mother won't let me watch that. it just keeps your kids more curious and more obligated to hide things from you and like they cannot ask you questions or be open and honest with you. Causes children to go behind your back more and when they're in trouble they'll as if your they're last place where they can ask for help, where you should be they're first resort.         No, I do not believe that libraries should censor anything. Its altering a authors work. How would it feel if you had written something and it had been published and was in the library and didn't like something about it so they decided to just bleep it out or not allow certain people to read it? I believe censorship should be illegal not required.          Sheltering things from kids prevents them from maturing, and discovering the real world. The idea that the world has no evil, or hiding the evil from your children will in most cases cause them to rebel and in other cases leave them unprepared for the future and the real world. Wouldn't you rather be able to help your kids and teach them about things instead of tell them that everything is perfect and only bad people use that kind of language. Or make them feel like a bad person for do something your grandparents did when they were young?      I conclude that censorship is injust, unfair, and is the real wrong. Not the profanity or the violence that will one day be apart of their life in some way. You don't go through everyday in the 'real world' with a mindset of there's nothing wrong in this world. Or everything is censored and everything is controlled  I believe censorship is just another way of controlling the mind through nuture.Version Girl, what's your name?.With fists flying up in the air   Like we're holding onto something   That's invisible there,   'Cause we're living at the mercy of   The pain and the fear   Until we get it, forget it,   Let it all disappear..We sat there and talked as an hour passed like old friends..I will never let you change your mind      [Chorus x 2]      Every time I wind up back at your door   Every time I wind up back at your door.Like a fire in the ring, like a fire in the ring..I'm a vain, a pro and a nation,   Had to do drugs to stop the,   F-food cravings..Satisfy my soul, satisfy my soul, satisfy my soul, satisfy my soul:   That's all I want you to do, that's all I'll take from you,   Satisfy my soul, satisfy my soul..Bless me, lord!"".You could make a total fool of me..Have you seen me, well I've seen you..Ooh ooh ooh complete control, even over this song      They said we'd be artistically free   When we signed that bit of paper   They meant let's make a lotsa mon-ee   An' worry about it later      Ooh ooh ooh I'll never understand   Ooh ooh ooh complete control -

"Censorship in @ORGANIZATION1 has been around for as long as their has been the various mediums of art. In many cases the censorship @CAPS9 of what many would agree as not suitable material for anyone to create and enjoy. But then in other more serious issues that the censor has deemed not suitable for a certain audience, or even to a whole country. What @CAPS9 it that gives a select few the right to ban any given number of imaginative creations, even if they are in some aspects more lued in nature?     Censorship has and @CAPS9 still a very usefull tool that many governments employ to accomplish a wide variety of tasks, considered to ensure the 'safety' of both our minds and bodies. Some of the more widely know cases of this most despicable tactic of control come from the countries of @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @LOCATION3, @LOCATION4R, @CAPS3 @LOCATION5, and @LOCATION2. In these countries all materials that are deemed potentially hazardous to the wellfare of the @ORGANIZATION2 are heavily policed and in many cases destroyed. The most noteworthy instances of this occured in @LOCATION3, where the @CAPS4 would gather up large amounts of books from the people and burn them in massive rallies. The people were so enthralled by the @CAPS5 leadership that they would often times freely relenquish their books with no resistance, and in some cases join in and throw the books in themselves. The same thing @CAPS9 still occuring in @LOCATION5 today, wtih a censor still on their internet surfing possibilities. In @DATE1 the popular search engine @ORGANIZATION3 attempted to set up shop in the country, but quickly entered into dispute with the @ORGANIZATION2 about the censoring of certain materials. Some months after the argument began over the censoring of @LOCATION5's people, the company completely removed all bans for a short time, much to the dismay of the @ORGANIZATION2. During that time it @CAPS9 reported that some of the main search topics were that of many social reformers and of different religions than that of the @ORGANIZATION2's sanctioned religion. But the one country that takes the cake for having the most censorship @CAPS9 @LOCATION2, they're @ORGANIZATION2 has restricted and policed any technology in the country. The common people live in a so called '@CAPS6 @CAPS7 @CAPS8'.     In our home country of the @LOCATION1 we are promised many rights to protect our freedom as citizens. We are promised the freedom of speech as well as press, and in censoring our libraries they would restrict both. If we do not stand up and protect our rights, then who will? Are we not a @ORGANIZATION2 for the people, by the people? Why are we allowing the censorship of our own intellectual creations in a place that was created to provide access to said materials for those who are less fortunate, so they themselves can gain knowledge and understanding. If we as a people were to allow such a blatent restriction on our given freedoms, then we are in no position to have them in the first place. Our country was founded and later almost torn apart by the men and women who were willing to risk it all in order to protect their freedoms in this country. Are we descendants of those same people? If so why should we allow ourselves to squander what was hard fought for and earned by our forefathers.     The censor often poses a few questions that do cause one to wonder '@CAPS9 it really better off this way?'. They point out that for every great work of intellegent art, other of a more deviant nature create some more innapropriate pieces of 'art'. Pornography @CAPS9 the most prevalent of their examples, pointing out that if they did not restrict it, then who would stop the hundreds of children that not only roam the libraries bookshelves but also the provided internet services. It @CAPS9 a reasonable question, once that should be take into consideration, but in answer to it I believe that it @CAPS9 and will always be the job of the parent or guardian that bring the child with them. It @CAPS9 simply not enough to drop a child off at the local library and hope they find something interesting. Helping that child find what they want @CAPS9 a journey that should be taken by both the parent and the child. And what about those who believe the censor isn't always right about what @CAPS9 and what @CAPS9 not acceptable for the general @ORGANIZATION1? As author Katherine Paterson once said 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf-- that work I abhor -- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.'     Censorship has been around for a very long time, and will most likely never be fully cut out of any functioning @ORGANIZATION2. That @CAPS9 sadly an inevibility that cannot be avoided. But the amount that it occurs in your daily life will be directly affected by how much of your freedom you are willing to stand up for..The Valleys of Neptune is arising --      3..Shrivel-up   Well

"Censorship has become a major topic when it comes to books, music, and movies.  These are being censored because people don't want young kids to read, listen, or watch these materials.  What about the adults?  Books, music, and movies being taken off of the shelfs in libraries because of censorship, is not fair to the adults.     Books now are being rewriten so they won't have offevsive language in them.  To @CAPS1 A @CAPS2 is a classic example of this.  Changing the offensive language in this book would totally ruin it.  This book is mainly about the racism that whites had towards the african americans, and if that was altered the readers wouldn't get a sense of that racism.  If libraries have books that are censored they should put them on a shelf just for censored books so adults could still be able to read them.     Music is another peice of material that censorship has gotten a hold of.  Offensive language is being taken out  of songs and uncensored cd's are not being sold in some stores because of censorship.  Some adults like the original songs with the original words.  Libraries should carry both the explicit and the clean verions of cd's to they some them that are suitable for kids and the ones that adults can listen to.     Movies are another peice of material that censorship has taken over.  They are being rated @CAPS3, suitable for all ages, @NUM1, suitable for children @NUM2 and older, and rated @CAPS4, suitable for people @NUM3 and older.  These rating are good guidelines, but parents should be the ones to make the final decision on whether or not their child should be able to watch a certain movie.  Libraries should have all kind of movies on their shelfs.  If a twelve year old kid wants to watch a @NUM1 or rated @CAPS4 movie, he or she should be able to with the consint of a parent or guardian.     Censoship is a good thing but it doesn't need to be taken to the extreme.  If an adult wants to read a censored book, he or she should still be able to read it at their local libary and if a young kid wants to watch a rated @CAPS4 movie, he or she should be able to with the consint of a parent or guardian..Put me in the motorcade   Put me in the death parade   Dress me up and take me   Dress me up and make me your dying god      Angels with needles poke through our eyes

"There should not be a certain kinds of books in the library. Books should not be tooken off the shelf just because some people find them offensive. Do not get the book, other people might like it, its just for entertainment.     If you do not like the book do not have to get the book. While looking for a book if there is one that does not seem right just look past. It will not even be a bother. There is a lot of books in the library, just find a different book instead of just focusing on that one book. There will always be many more books there to look at. If there is a bad book just go to a different section in the library. There is going to be more good books for a person than bad books.     If other people would like the book then the library will not take the book off of the shelves. It @MONTH1 be offensive to some people but there will be some other people in the world that likes that same book. Some people go to the library just to see them kind of books. Certain people like certain types of books, maybe it was not the right section for a person to be in. The book could be a interesting book all there is to do is try it. If anything the reader might even like the book and check it out.     The books are there for entertainment. Thats why they have so much different sections and selections to choose from. If an adult does not like a kid book because its giving the kid the wrong idea then do not get the book for the kid. A different parent might come in and think that the book will be great for their child though.      Books should be sat out on the shelf for anybody that goes to the library. The librarians will not take books off the shelf for one persons opinion. When  all they have to do is do not get the book, think that others might like it, or remember they are there for the readers entertainment..Guitar ]      Sounds of laughter everywhere and the dancing girls swayin' to and fro      I must declare my heart is there although I've been from Maine to Mexico      But I'm sad to say...

"Walking in to the library and looking for a good book or magazine to read, you run into some of those disgusting books that are offensive to some people. Some people think they should be removed from the shelves, and I am one of them. Are you?     There are some books, magazines, movies, and ect., that we all run into that have very bad language, racism, bad religious talking, and even some about sex. Nobody needs to be reading those kind of books, it is bad for our minds and is very offensive to some people. A lot of people do not like to hear curse words or see them. Seeing those words in a book will make that person think wrong things about the library and put the wrong words in their head. Then there are those books about racism and that is the worst topic to most people. If someone came across that in a book, it would hurt their feelings and they would not want to finish that book. Their are others that are very religious and if they come across something that is wrong about their religion the will be very offended.      There are a few ways that the library could handle the books that offend people. The librarian could think about putting a warning sign up and seperating those books, magazines, and etc., into their own section for people that do get offended by those things know where they are and know not to look there. Or inside the front cover the librarian could put a warning note on there to show the person that there are some things in there that @MONTH1 offend someone. It would be very helpful to so many people!      In every library you won't see that all the books are perfectly good. We all know that there are going to be some bad things in books, but there are some books that are way too inapropriate and those books can be removed. There are just way too many people that get offended while reading the books they want to read. Let's put a stop to it.     In conclusion, many of the libraries around are going to have the kind of books that offend some people. There can be a stop to that by removing them from the shelves or at least warning others about the things in the books, magazines, and all the other entertainment people like these days. It would be amazing to know that all the people that love to read will not be offended by what they are reading!.Oh!.I found you..It's deep insignus   That knows me well   It's all around me   My mind can tell      And all the children   They know my name   They scream forever   I know the pain      Oh, feel the pain   Oh, feel the pain   Oh, feel the pain   Oh, feel the pain      It's a sleep insignus   That knows me well   She's got the fever   She's hot as hell      And all the children   They know my name   When night is coming   They'll scream in pain      Oh, scream in pain   Oh, scream in pain   Oh, scream in pain   Oh, scream in pain      Yayaya....Whenever I was down did you try to pick me up?.I'm alive   'Cause Jesus gave me life   He opened up my eyes   I can see clearly now      Oh, everybody dance now, oh      Everybody, give it up for Jesus   Give Him glory, for He has redeemed us   Everybody, give it up for Jesus   Praise His name      My desire   Is to lift You higher   It's only burning brighter   This passion inside of me      Oh, everybody dance now, oh      Everybody, give it up for Jesus   Give Him glory, for He has redeemed us   Everybody, give it up for Jesus   Praise His name   [x2]      This praise is bursting out   And I can't contain it now   This praise is bursting out   Out, out, 1, 2, let's go      Everybody, give it up for Jesus   Give Him glory, for He has redeemed us   Everybody, give it up for Jesus   Praise His name   [x2].[Verse 1: Niall]   Remember the day we were giving up when you told me I didn't give you enough   And all of your friends were saying I'll be leaving you   She's lying in bed with my t-shirt on, just thinking how I went about it wrong   This isn't the stain of a red wine, I'm bleeding love      [Pre-Chorus: Liam]   Please believe me, don't you see   The things you mean to me?.To sleep, perchance to dream ...

  When all she had to do was step into the light   For everyone to start to roar..It's good to see your face in the morning   It helps me to face the day   I see you lighting candles   As I turn away      I want you, I need you in a way that confuses me but   It's good to hold you   But it's better when you're not there   It's better when you're not there   It's better when I don't care about the things you say in the world's worst way   It's better when you're not there      But somehow it waits 'til the morning   I feel your eyes on me   It's a such a perfect moment   It almost sets me free      I wanted to keep you holding in while you're pulling away   It's good to know you but it's better when you're not there   It's better when you're not there   It's better when I don't care about the things you say in the world's worst way   It's better when you're not there   It's better when you're not there      It's good to see your face in the picture   It's amazing what I miss   It's always right in the moment   When you're colored by your kiss      I wanted to tell you there are times when I think of your face   It's good to know you   But it's better you're not there   It's better when you're not there   It's better when I don't care about the things you say in the worlds worst way   It's better when you're not there   It's better when you're not there.Deep in my bones, straight from inside..Mother, mother ocean, I've heard you call   Wanted to sail upon your waters   Since I was three feet tall   You've seen it all, you've seen it all      Watch the men who rode you   Switch from sails to steam   And in your belly you can hold the treasures   Few have ever seen   Most of them dream   Most of them dream      Yes, I am a pirate two hundred years too late   Cannons don't thunder there's nothin' to plunder   I'm an over forty victim of fate   Arriving too late, arriving too late      But I've done a bit of smugglin'   I've run my share of grass   Made enough money to buy Miami   But I pissed it away so fast   Never meant to last   Never meant to last      I have been drunk now for over two weeks   Passed out and I rallied and I sprung a few leaks   But I've got to stop wishin', got to go fishin'   I'm down to rock bottom again..She said I know you gave me everything   But love is not enough, love is not enough, love is not enough      Who the fuck

You ain't gotta worry bout sharin' this success with Wayne   Now it's just petty change   But I still feel the pain      Rollin' down 20 man   With this Jack in my cup, feelin' down on my luck   And I'm doin 120 man   Maybe I'm givin' up, baby I'm givin up   Baby what is happening?.I'm cryin' on a gravel shoulder..(When will you make up your mind?)"
"Many people in the @LOCATION1 read. Books, magazines, news papers, and music are a great passing time. I enjoy reading books about people with special powers; such as necromancers. If we were to take such books that offend someone out of our libraries, what would we have left? I, for one, don't like reading @ORGANIZATION1 books, which seem to be the only type of book that wouldn't offend someone, unless they have some severe hatred towards letters.      Think for a moment about what you like. Think about your interest in music, art, and the style of books or magazines that you read. Now imagine all of those gone from the one place you can get away from screaming children or annoying neighbors: the library. You @MONTH1 be baffled as to why all of your loves have dissappeared. That book you love, the one about necromancers, it's offensive to @CAPS1 because only @CAPS2 has the power of waking the dead. The song that you have had stuck in your head all day is now no longer online. Its use of certain words are offensive to those with 'sensitive' ears.      If I were to walk into a library and find that all the 'offensive' works had been band, I would be shocked. Every one in the universe finds certain things offensive. My @CAPS3 @CAPS4 teacher thinks that rap and hip-hop or pop songs are offensive to women and their bodies, but I think that some of those songs hold a different meaning. If everything offensive were to be taken away, what would be left? Nothing that a teenager or an adult would want to read. Heck, @PERSON1' works are offensive to some people, they think he was crazy, and who wants their children to read a book written by a bafoon?      Also, the less the library contains, the less people go. Libraries would soon close because everything is being found as offensive. All of the books we had hoped to read would have to be bought online, if it were still allowed.     For all of the Book @CAPS5 out there, finding an attention-getting, eye-opening book is like finding buried treasure. It's an event that changes your life, makes your blood rush, and leaves you hanging onto your seat. It's an adventure played in your head, one that you set the specific details of each character, or it's the book that provides the knowledge that feeds your brain every time a new sentence is stored. Taking away everything offensive is like having a child being taken away, you can't replace that love with a distraction.Best Man sent all their clothes back, Roches Stores   Sent back their booze..Don't look now, you better watch that sword that's hanging over you   It's a long hard road and they will spit you out   When they get through with you   Don't hang your head, so the wise man

"Certain materials, such as books, music, magizines, etc., should never be removed just because a certain person, or group of people, find it offensive. The authors of these books have the right, as stated in the @CAPS1 of the @LOCATION1, to have the freedom to say what the wish within the context of their own individual wrighting. Also, certain materials that some people find offensive have little to no offensiveness to many other people who @MONTH1 enjoy the book or movie. Finally, many books that are on the shelves of many of our libraries have no end to the amount of things that @MONTH1 be considered offensive, but allow a certain knowledge to be had by, not only the writer, but the reader as well.      If something is stated in such an important document as the @CAPS1 of the @LOCATION1, one that set the standard for living and set the laws of a nation to parchment, than it should, for lack of a better term, be taken with the utmost respect and dignity. Several great leaders, such as the first president of the @ORGANIZATION1, @LOCATION2, decided that freedom of the press was a viable asset to a new and growing country. This simple fact alone should hold more than enough levity to allow all materials, no matter how offensive, to not only be published, but also enjoyed by all people. It is this simple freedom that causes books to be published, even written, no matter how offensive they @MONTH1 be.     Certain materials that a person, or group of people, find offensive @MONTH1 not be offensive to everyone. No matter what religion, ethnicity, or moral values you hold, just because it is offensive to you does not mean that it is offensive to everyone. Many people in this world serve in their nations military, ones used to fight more battles than any history book could hold, is just one example that not everyone in this world holds the same morals or ideas that others do, and tensions will always arise because of it. That being said, this also holds true to the way certain people percieve literature and art. @ORGANIZATION3 would hate @ORGANIZATION2's art, and @ORGANIZATION2 would hate @ORGANIZATION3's, however, neither has the right to condone it or to keep it from the eyes of the world.     Many times literature gets removed before their true meaning can be shown to anyone. This is disheartening for several reasons, one being that whatever we, as a human race, could've learned from this piece is now lost forever. Many books could teach the older generations how to leave a legacy for generations to come. Others @MONTH1 teach how future generations can change the world by simply working hard and doing their best. These are best portrayed in books that are sometimes removed from the shelves because of hard lessons or graphic words used.      Is censorship in libraries ok? No. Not at all. All works of literature should be allowed to be read and enjoyed, not only by the author, but also by the young, the old, and all ages in between, of all races and religions. The longer we allow materials to be removed from the shelves of our libraries, the less of a chance we are giving, not only ourselves, but future generations to learn and be all that they can possibly be..And I tried him for my self, and ooooo I'm a living witness that God will take the pain away      He'll take the pain away,I know   He'll take the pain away (x2)      Hold on don't give up      If

spouse   Something in your blouse got me feeling so aroused   What you about   On that independent shit   Trade it all for a husband and some kids   You ever wonder what it all really mean   You ever wonder if you'll find your dreams.The journey begins with curiosity   And evolves into soul-felt questions   On the stones that we walk   And choose to make our path   Sometimes never knowing   Other times knowing too much      Filtering out the bad that holds us back   Take hold of what is true to your hunger   A hunger that will not go away   Plans for tomorrow, they will remain      Won't you join me on the perennial quest   Reaching into the dark, retrieving light   Search for answers on the perennial quest   Where dreams are followed, and time is a test      No time for mental crutches   The maker has moved on   I will take it raw and be on my way      Those that stood beside me   I'm glad you understand   Behind these written words   I share the simple plan   To hang on to the way that we feel      From rivers of sorrow   To oceans deep with hope   I have travelled them   Now, there is no turning back   The limit, the sky   I ask my questions Why?.93 million miles from the sun   People get ready, get ready   'Cause here it comes, it's a light   A beautiful light, over the horizon   Into our eyes   Oh, my my how beautiful   Oh my beautiful mother   She told me, son in life you're gonna go far   If you do it right, you'll love where you are   Just know, wherever you go   You can always come home      240 thousand miles from the moon   We've come a long way to belong here   To share this view of the night   A glorious night   Over the horizon is another bright sky   Oh my my how beautiful, oh my irrefutable father   He told me, son sometimes it may seem dark   But the absence of the light is a necessary part   Just know, you're never alone, you can always come back home      Oh, oh      You can always come back      Every road is a slippery slope   But there is always a hand that you can hold on to   Looking deeper through the telescope   You can see that your home's inside of you      Just know, that wherever you go   No you're never alone   You will always get back home      Oh, oh   Oh, oh   Oh      93 million miles from the sun   People get ready, get ready   'Cause here it comes, it's a light   A beautiful light, over the horizon   Into our eyes"
"Some books on the shelf at libraries have bad things in it, whether it is what the book is about, the curse words in them, or just not very aproprit for some of the age groups. Should the books at the libraries be censored or should we just leave them for the reader to decide if they want to read it or not?     I dont think any of the books, or magazines should be censered. If some one wants to read a book with curse words in it or anything like that then let them. The parents @MONTH1 not let some kids read them but some parents just dont care. I think if they read them they might say them but they will learn not to say them and that they are not very nice to say.       Should the movies you get at libraries be censered? I dont think they should because the parents arent going to let them get it or watch the movie if they dont think it is something they need to be watching. The kids know what they can and cant watch so if it is something they know they cant watch then they shouldnt get it. The kids might get it but the parents could take it away and tell them they cant watch it.      Should all books.magazines, music, or movies from libraries be censered? No. If it is a library at school everything has to be school approprit. If the book, movie, magazine, or music is not approprit they the school cant lone it out. A public library can but there are mostly adults there. The kids should know what they can and cant watch, read, or listen to, so they should know better than to get something they cant read, watch, listen to, or look at. Some parents @MONTH1 agree to censering them but if you do that you are limiting the books everyone can read. Even the parents or adults wouldnt be able to read them aswell.What do you see?.I wanna be a New York Ranger   I wanna live the life of danger   I wanna be a New York Ranger   I wanna live the life of

"To censor, or not to censor? That is the question. I am positive that there are a great amount of different views portaining to this topic. Everyone will have very good points on either using, or not using censorship in the library. Although this is true, I believe that there are many more valid reasons not to use censorship in libraries. First of all, how offensive can library material truly be?     I do not believe that is very offensive at all. There will be movies and material specifically designed for a mature an older age group. This is fine; if the person choosing the material is of age then he or she should have no reason not to choose advanced material. A mature person will not want to read elementary books their entire life. Sooner or later, they will have to be intruduced into the real life. It would not be beneficial to them or society if they are sheltered their entire lives. Also, if the person is still a child, there should be no reason for a child to choose the older level of material. There @MONTH1 be times when he does; however, this is not a problem because all the parent has to do is explain to him that he is not of age yet. This is an easy fix. As I said earlier, ther is no reason we all need to read the same thing.     Variety is what makes libraries apealing to the customers. Who would want to go to a library with all the same books? I myself would not. Within the library, there are sections specifically just for children. If all the slightly offensive material was to be taken out of libraries, that would eliminate a large portion of the customers. Also, this would discourage writers from even producing thier material; thus hindering their income and motivation. We have freedom and choice in @LOCATION1, and I feel this would go against @CAPS1 values if they were to induce censorhip in a harmless library.      No one is perfect and we all make mistakes. However, we can also improve and learn from them. If a person does choose an inapropriate book, they will most likely learn and improve from their mistake. We have a choice about what to choose when we go into the library. I believe if not all, the majority of the time we make the right choice.     Libraries are a supercenter of learning and information. This would not be true if certain portions of information began to be removed. I have had many worthwhile times in the library and was never once harmed or offended. Libraries are here to help and not to hinder our learning. I am most likely not the only one who feels pleased with the way libraries are now and feel no need to change what is good.Do you dream of me?.Heart beyond repair,   All the edges worn and frayed   Magnifying love betrayed..Hey there baby, you're not shy   We talk for hours and you seem just fine girl, but...

"Leave @CAPS1 on the Shelves                                             In every library it is intitle to have all types of books, movies, and magazines.Even if they are good or bad. Not everyone in this world is going to have the same likings.If there are people that are offened of what types of sources they find in the library I don't think it should be taken off of the shelves. Everyone in able to agree or disagree in what types of things they like.      If the library didn't how would people learn about things today that are going on in this world, because not everything that is said on television is true. Every library in the world should not take certian books, movies, and magazines down just so kids or anyone else can't read @CAPS1 or watch @CAPS1 because there might be other people who would like to read @CAPS1 or watch @CAPS1. If the libraries took down certain books, movies, and magazines then it shouldn't even be called a library because it is suppose to have all types of sources.     Not everyone is going to have the same opinion on whether or not certain books,movies, or magazines should be in the library, but all types of these sources should stay in the library beacuse if they are offensive to some people there aren't going to be like that for everyone so that wouldnt't be fair for the other people who enjoy reading, looking at magazines to see whats new ,or watching all different types of moive, and listening to music.     I think that the librarians should not take anything down in their libraries because they know what they are doing when they put those sources on the shelves and also they should stay on the shelves because if they didn't want people to feel offended then they wouldn't have made books, moive, or magazine that would offend people today.     Libraries don't leave the sources on the shelves on perpose for people to feel offended, they leave @CAPS1 for other people to read.With this being said all types or books, magazines, or movies should be left on the shelves to help other people learn what they want to learn about.Yeah, that's my bodyguard   Wear a lot of jewelry, Young don't do security   What's whiter than a napkin, harder than a

"Picture for yourself you, as a @NUM1 year old child sitting in front of one of the greatest philosophers of history, @LOCATION1. Days later, you come to find out that he has been killed for 'corrupting the minds of the children.' @CAPS1 what? One of the greatest minds in human history has been censored because they didn't like his ideas. This is censorship at a basic level, and it happens to millions of books, movies, and songs every day. Censorship is not only wrong, its unnecessary. Here's why.     @CAPS1, when it comes down to it, most books, movies, and songs are meant to be interpreted in many different ways. For example, some poems are written with a vague tone so that they can be interpreted in different ways based upon the person. Besides, most music and books are meant to entertain, not offend. Granted, some books are meant to be interpreted in a certain way, but that still doesn't mean that they were meant to offend. Think about it next to you look at a copy of '@CAPS2 @CAPS3' by @PERSON1; is it really that offensive to you?     When you are given a book in school for a class assignment, they usually expect you to read it because its of some educational value to you. Books like 'To @CAPS4 a @CAPS5' provide a huge educational value because they show what @CAPS6 culture was like, but everyday, someone new is trying to get it off the shelves of every school library in @LOCATION2 because they find it offensive. Ask yourself, is it right? The answer for me is no, since books like that hold an educational value that outweighs their offensiveness.     There's one last thing you must understand, and that is the fact that no matter how many books you take off the shelves, and no matter how many movies you ban, or how many songs you take away from us, the problem still isn't solved, its just been suppressed enough for different problems to arise, and those problem are that there are people who wanted to read this book @CAPS1 can't because you thought it was offensive. @CAPS1 this person complains to whomever banned this form of literature, and the book or other form of literature is put back on the shelves. @CAPS1 you feel it right to try and ban it again, but what does that solve? Nothing. Even if someone doesn't unban it, people can still teach and tell of what its about, making the ban worthless.     I hope that before you think about complaining about some book you found offensive, you think about this. Your complaint that causes the banning affects everyone. It affects a teacher's ability to teach, and a student's ability to learn. Is it really right of you to take away a good teaching material? Or you could ask yourself, what does it really solve? Either way, you still must know that bannig these things in wrong..I want to see you again,   And again,   And again..I'm only here to comfort you..There's one less place at our table..Brrrrrravo!.Well I says ""Lukey the blinds are down""   Ha, me boys!.And do they listen in on you?.The name she gave was Caroline   Daughter of a miner   Her ways were free   It seemed to me   That sunshine walked beside her      She came from Spencer   Across the hill   She said her pa had sent her   'cause the coal was low   And soon the snow   Would turn the skies to winter      She said she'd come   To look for work   She was not seeking favors   And for a dime a day   And a place to stay   She'd turn those hands to labor      But the times were hard, Lord,   The jobs were few   All through Tecumseh valley   But she asked around   And a job she found   Tending bar at Gypsy Sally's      She saved enough to get back home   When spring replaced the winter   But her dreams were denied   Her pa had died   The word come down from Spencer      So she turned to whorin' out on the streets   With all the lust inside her   And it was many a man   Returned again   To lay himself beside her      They found her down beneath the stairs   That led to Gypsy Sally's   In her hand when she died   Was a note that cried   Fare thee well   Tecumseh valley      The name she gave was Caroline   Daughter of a miner   Her ways were free   It seemed to me   That sunshine walked beside her.I cannot say, yeah..Sail on my brother   Sail on through the night   Sail on my sister   Sail on through the night      Beautiful as the day is long   Beautiful as the day is long      Sail on your troubles   Sail on through your doubts   Sail on your worries   Sail on soon you'll work it out      Beautiful as the day is long   Beautiful as the day is long      I've always been a believer   In the good things of life   But they don't all come wrapped in cellophane   And they don't always seem to turn out right   They don't always seen to turn out right      I've always been a believer   In the good things of life   But they don't all come wrapped in cellophane   And they don't always seem to turn out right   No, no, no,   They don't always seen to turn out right   Sometimes they do not   Humm.... sail on.I need you email me love mail   We don't use no word no   When I need to hear your voice   Baby may your kisses chill me   Send your flowers near to me, Love Mail      I need you email me love mail   We don't use no word no   When I need to hear your voice   Baby may your kisses chill me   Send your flowers near to me, Love Mail      I need you email me love mail   We don't use no word no   When I need to hear your voice (chill hear your voice)   Baby may your kisses chill me (chill me)   Send your flowers near to me, Love Mail.Just a quiet peaceful dance!.I drive through my neighborhood ringin' my bell..Baby yeah loving you the way you do is ridiculous..What's the basis?.I can't stand your alibis   Your tellin' lies, you drive me wild!.What if this song does nothing   What if this song does nothing      Bring on the requisite strangeness   It always has to get a little weird a little weird   Yea you just bring on the requisite strangeness   Bring it on then disappear disappear   Go to be a man of the boom   To Florida without the ocean   But   Don't you wanna see how it ends?.Exodus, foundation a better world..Oh cleanser of the mess I've made   Upon the hill our places trade   Stretched on a cross Your body crushed   By human hands You formed from dust      [Chorus]   How wonderful Your mercy is   How awesome are Your ways   I come, I come   To worship You   For all You've done   Oh cleanser of the mess I've made   Your boundless love for me portrayed   With patience for my learning curve   By holding back what I deserve      [Chorus]      Oh cleanser of the mess I've made   With everything at Your feet laid   I watch as all my cares erode   And from my soul these words explode      [Chorus].Come see, high above..I can't stop this feeling I got   I feel it right down to my toes   I can't stop this feeling I got   My body got to have it you know   I can't stop this feeling I got   I'll write a letter to the whole world   I can't stop this feeling I got   Every man, woman, boy and girl      Can't stop this feeling I got, I can't stop this feeling I got   I can't stop this feeling I got, I can't stop this feeling I got      I can't stop this feeling I got   You know I can't sleep at night   I can't stop, you know I love it a lot,   I'm talking about an everlasting light..Some time you'll get to see,   You where you want to be..I got a hundred years of down home running through my blood."
"There are many inapropriate types of intertainment in the world but does that mean we should take them all away? I believe that censoring things such as books, movies and music in a library is not a good idea. We would not have any diversity in the world or any type of intertainment because everyone has a different view on what they think is offensive or inapropriate.     With censoring materials in a library it will extremly limit on what we can learn. For example if someone thought that a book about how an animal catches it pray was offensive then if a person was interested in learnig about that topic they would not able to. Many peoples only way of reserch is at a library, so if they had on assignment for work and they could only get informatoin on it there they would not be able to finish their job if only one person thought a book about that topic was offincive. Also people in the medical feild have to watch many movies deminstrating sertain proseedures. What would they do if one person thought that a movie on what they were doing was offensive? They might not be able to save a persons life.     With censoring there would be no diverstiy. Censoring would cause us to have a very small choise in what we could read for intertainment. It might even cause us to not have any books to read for intertainment because it one person does not like a sertain book it can be gotten rid of. So if not all the books are gone there is still going to be a few books to chose from. It would cause all to read the same books therefor making the diverstiy very small.     I see only a few good points in censoring. Yes, it would prevent children from learning or hearing about inapropriate or offensive things but, that is what is in our world and i believe that we just have to accept it. Our society today is filled with crime, haterid, sexually things, and profanity but there is no changing that. Censoring @MONTH1 hide that for a small amount of time but its not going to keep it away forever. Censoring is not going to change our society.     I do not think that we should censor thing in our libaries. It can only lead to a downfall in our communitys. It is a great idea but i do not believe that it can help us more than it would hurt us. Censoring will cuz a lack in diversity education and a realization of our society.Tes au creux de moi   Dans ma vie, dans tout ce que je fais   Mes premiers amours, mes premiers are?.Mare di guai   che nessuno asciugher?.My mommy told me   If I were goody   That she would buy me   A rubber dolly      I got some energy to burn   It makes me jumpy and nervous   But I'm too damn old to join the military service   Hup two three four   I got to hit my baby on a Saturday night   You know the devil made me do it   I know it wasn't right      Like a loco mosquito   'Round and 'round and 'round I go   And when I'm hungry   Down I go      Please Mr. Custer I don't want to go   And spend my night in a bar with some stupid dodo   I'm sick of hanging 'round with old transvestites   They stare at my rubbers   It makes me uptight      And here I go   In love again   Here I go-oh wo wo   Like a loco mosquito      I got some energy to burn   But you always want to tap it   You're busy sucking on my gas tank   Before I can tap it      Like a loco mosquito   'Round and 'round and 'round I go   And when I'm hungry   Down I go      Loco Mosquito.St?!.Say it's not so that you rather lose me   If you're disposed to say forget it   You don't suppose you might regret it      Give it a go, let's make our break now   Don't look down your nose, or so I'll pick now   For all we know, there's not much time left   If you give me a no, you leave me be runt      I'm not saying that you can't find yourself someone better   Oh no, but in the meantime, why not give it a go, give it a go      Give it a go   Give it a go   Give it a go   Give it a go      Taken away, shed all I've got now   Catch the bouquet, let's tie the knots down   A beautiful day you're smile has crowned   If you're looking for love I think you found it      I'm not saying that you can't find yourself someone better   Oh no, but in the meantime, why not give it a go,   You could be aiming for a cool time, you know   A real twin set up hello   But in the meantime, why not give me a go, give me a go      Give it a go   Give it a go   Give it a go   Give it a go   Give it a go   Give it a go   Give it a go   Give it a go   Give it a go   Give it a go   Give it a go      I'm not saying that you can't find yourself someone better   Oh no, but in the meantime, why not give it a go,   You could be aiming for a cool time, you know   A real twin set up hello   But in the meantime, why not give me a go, give me a go      Give it a go, give it a go.You ain't ready for it bitch      I already got, two cars in the yard that don't run   So why would I wanna break shit down for you?.Who were you thinkin' about?.I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT THE QUESTION IS!!.I bombed Korea every night..(How much do you need?).Woe to the downpressors:   They'll eat the bread of sad tomorrow!.Lost through a hole in the garden wall   On the wrong side of the looking glass   Call, should you need a companion home   You know you only need to ask   Crazy Lady Blue   I sympathize with what you're going through   Crazy Lady Blue   I'm crazy just to have you be my love   Hide in the puzzle you call your world   Baby, I know all about the game   Cry when the walls of the maze crash down   I'll come and take away your pain   Crazy Lady Blue   Someday your head may get the best of you   Crazy Lady Blue   I'm crazy just to have you be my love.It's 7:00 A.M.!.Well, I used to have the notion I could swim the length of the ocean   If I knew that you were waiting for me   I used to have the notion I could swim the length of the ocean   I'd plumb the depths of every sea for you   I'd escape from my chains, and I'll reach out for you      Maybe I'm in love with you   Maybe, maybe I'm in love with you   I had to contact you, found out I was in love with you   I had to contact,      That's it, that's the law, that's the whole of the law   The whole of the law..Yep   Love Some Waffle House?.All right now, what a lovely way to burn..The girl is on to you..Will there be tomorrow, Will there be the stars   Will there be a future, Time beats in our hearts   Will there still be laughter, Will there be relief   Will there be religion, Will there be belief      Will you see your people, From your former lifes   Will you know them this time, Will you win the prize   Will there be an ending, Will there be a start   Or will there be fire, Branding you his mark      I pray for all us people, Trying to solve the riddle   I don't know where we're going   I don't know if we're being true, On Occasion Avenue      Mother, I dreamt of my last life   (You'll never find what you left behind)   Mother, I killed you with my knife   (No indulgence or its death you find)      Oh, oh, we got to make it through, Occasion Avenue      Follow your heart, Follow your truth   Follow the path that shines for you   On Occasion Avenue   How far you go, How good you do   Uncovers the prize or rebears for you   To Occasion Avenue      Domini, domini -

"Should you conceal a child from the inappropriate half of the world? Not letting them hear, see, or read the bad in the world. Letting them grow up as innocent as possible. Should libraries take these procautions?     In a world like ours were bad things happen everyday when it comes to people comminting suicide, being murdered, goverment scams, and even terrorist attacks its hard to keep people that shouldnt know, from knowing. It is very easy for our nation to figure things out, all we have to do is watch @CAPS1.V. or even go to our local library. While we already censor what goes onto our television, we dont think to care as much for our libraries. Our libraries have anything from thousands of book and magizines and now having an equal, or more, amounts of movies, @CAPS2, and videogames.     I think a library should have censorship when it comes to what they have and how they organize it. There should be different sections of libraries, much like they do now, of age groups and what is appropriate for them, and to avoid people checking-out items that are from sections above them they have an age group security check on the libraries card fileing system. This sounds very complicated but at least we are doing as much as possible for trying not to expose anyone to anything they are to young for.     When it comes to offensive material, I think that should not be taken off the shelf but put into a different place in the library. Some people need to read some thing they find offensive, maybe they need to read it for a class, maybe the book is offensive but needs to be read because it teaches a very good life lesson. There is a book that is called '@CAPS3' its by a man with the last name of @LOCATION1. It sounds very offensive but it actually teaches people the origin of the word and how it came to be offensive to people. It @MONTH1 be offensive for some people to read but it teaches a lesson in why people shouldnt say it.     Yes, there are always going to be some parents out there that don'@CAPS1 care as much when it comes to what there child read, watches, listens to, or plays. But, for there kids to get it, there parents will have to come and get it for them, that way the parents know what they are extracting from the library..Cold is the colour of the dark..There's a rumor goin' 'round on the backside of town   Jake is out to get some revenge   Has fire in his eyes since his brother died   Shot down by a so-called friend      For a fifty dollar gram is what the neighbors say   Drugs had control of his life   Caught up on crack you're tryin' to think back   The devil had him hooked you could see it in his eyes   It's a killer      There's a cold house at the corner of the street   The kids come and go there at night   Jerry drove up in front of the house   Somebody pulled out a knife   Jerry freaked out and went for his gun   Shot him right between the eyes   All he ever wanted was a twenty dollar high   But now he's locked up for the rest of his life      [Chorus]   It's a killer there's no way out baby once your in   It's a killer steal from your family   Then you'll turn on your friends   It's a killer it can happen to you      So don't you never, never give in   It's a killer      The neighborhood I used to call home   These days it's lookin' like a war zone   Unemployment on the rise but the black market thrives   Money just keeps changin' hands   The laws are gettin' tough sometimes it's not enough   To satisfy supply and demand      Trouble breaks out there's fightin' in the streets   Bullets flyin' all around   An innocent child caught in the line of fire   All because there weren't enough drugs to go around      [Chorus: x2].All the strangers walk like you tonight..You never know what we could be in store for   The way it goes we're in for more of the same   One step beyond the flame   The thread of life, the finely woven pattern   Reveals designs in silent laughter and rhyme   One picture at a time      [Chorus]   There ain't nothing left behind us   Not a doubt inside us   If the angel calls tomorrow, there's nothing we haven't said   There ain't nothing left behind us   Nothing but a blind trust   I would beg, steal or borrow to never lose you again      It's down to us to figure out the secret   It's not enough to wait for pieces to fall   The writing isn't on the wall   Take my hand, we'll face the fire together   To distant lands, but we can weather the storm   Keeping each other warm      [Chorus]      There's never been an easy way   Everybody is bound to make mistakes   You just do what you think is right   Then laugh 'til you cry 'til you scream at the night      [Chorus].I feel like I could cry, feeling you next to me, aww, that makes me feel alright!.God knows you're stifling me   The lord knows you're stifling me   The lord knows you're trying to kill me.Love!.They about to drop me in the ground..Pizza, pizza pie   Every minute, every second   Buy, buy, buy, buy, buy   What a splendid pie?.You don't even get a lousy copy of our home game..[Verse 2:]   My birthday, everybody's here,   All except for one,   At the sleepover, you showed right then,   All the girls scream, except for me,   You have, roses in your hand,   Gave em to me and whispered,   Payin' you back,   Then, all the girls   Started to get that feeling...

"As an individual and what books I have read, I believe some books needs to be taken off the shelf. My concern is for the children who get a hold of these books. Kids should be kids and wait till they're older and more mature to know about certain things. This also includes music, movies, and magazines. Some people believe these things influence bad behavior like stealing, cussing, and even murder. The less obsene matterial we have the better we can control our kids or at least some of them anyway.         We see bad behavior every day like stealing, cussing, murder, and assault. Ever wonder what causes people to do it? Just look around you they show it in movies, they talk about it in books. theres even songs about it, no wonder kids think its okay to do these kind of things! If we limit these items we @MONTH1 see positive results.     Like I said before kids should be kids and be free of these obsene materials. They will be exposed to it sometime but hopefully when they're older. In the mean time censors should be put on these items or taken off the shelf..Chorus: (echo first part of each line, part with "" marks)   ""There's a beautiful home"", far over the sea   ""There's a beautifu home"", for you and for me   ""And it's glittering pow'r"", the sun outshines   ""And that beautiful home"", someday shall be mine....Did you see the lights   As they fell all around you   Did you hear the music   Serenade from the stars      Wake up, wake up   Wake up and look around you   We're lost in space   And the time is our own      Whoa, whoa   I      Did you feel the wind   As it blew all around you   Did you feel the love   That was in the air      Wake up, wake up   Wake up and look around you   We're lost in space   And the time is our own      Whoa, whoa   I      The sun comes up   And it shines all around you   You're lost in space   And the earth is your own      Whoa, whoa   Whoa.People everywhere are dying to be free..World without a breeze   Heartbeat of the heat above the harbour   Lazy day lies dazed upon the shelf   Atomic lizards lick at the blaze of the   Light that is forever   No move in the solid skies   No gleaming metal out of the   Breathtaking blue      My golden circus girls all sailed away   The lion tamers are no longer due to play   Whoever breaks the seven seals and lets   The angry angels free   I do not know   Just waiting here   For

"In a way many books are put on the library shelf for a reason. Some of the books take race, sexism, bullying, ect., to extreme. Putting myself in a child's shoes when they read those books, magazines, movies, music, ect., would have to be scary. The languages in movies and music are not what we think they are. Would you want your child, that's @NUM1, to go out and do what the other @NUM1 year olds do because they think it is cool for others to do?     Remember back in the days when you were young and your parents didn't have to worry about what you were doing because your generation wasn't like the generations now? Well, these generations to come will probably get worse if we don't do something about it now. Taking some books off a shelf, or taking profanities out of a song will not hurt a child or teenager one bit. These things are telling your children it is ok to have sex, smoke, drink, or even cuss.      I know that my mother worries about me @NUM3, because she's always calling me to check up on me and asking how my day was, or if i had any problems today. If we work together on taking care of all of the profanities then i bet the world would be a much safer and nicer place. Bullying wouldn't be a problem anymore; neither would cyer space or the drugs and alcohol. You need to step up and show your children that doing those things are not exceptable or nessesary in any life. Remember them that there is a whole life out there without the sex, drugs, and profanities.     So, the next time you think that your going to buy a dvd or a cd preview it before you buy it. Make sure that if your child listened to it that it wouldnt be hurtful or have any profanities in it. Make sure that you talk to your child about what is right and wrong. Lets make these profanities go away on their own. If they aren't something you want your child to listen to then you shouldn't listen to it either.But while I'm gone,      No, woman, no cry,   No, woman, no cry..Enjolras   Let others rise   To take our place   Until the earth is free!.In a field by the river   My love and I did stand..It ain't Over!!!!!.I feel like prayin', sayin', I'm gladly through      It's been a blue, blue day, I feel like runnin' away   I feel like runnin' away from the blues      How can I make believe that I don't sit and grieve   It's been a blue, blue day for me   I can't pretend and say that I don't love anyway   It's been a blue, blue day for me      I feel like cryin', dyin', what can I do?.Yes, I did, yes, I did   Somebody please tell him who the eff I is   I am Nicki Minaj, I mack them dudes up   Back coupes up, and chuck the deuce up      Boy, you got my heartbeat runnin' away   Beating like a drum and it's coming your way   Can't you hear that boom, boom-badoom boom, boom badoom-boom?.No one I think is in my tree,   I mean it must be high or low..Watch out!.How's about cookin' something up with me?.I really can't stay   Baby, it's cold outside   I've got to go away   Baby, it's cold out there   This evening has been   Been hoping   That you'd drop in   So very nice   I'll hold your hands   They're just like ice      My mother   Will start to worry   Beautiful   What you're hurry   And father   Will be   Pacing the floor   Listen   To that fireplace   Roar   So really   I'd better scurry   Beautiful   Please don't hurry   Well, maybe   Just a half   A drink more   Put some records on   While I pour      And the neighbors   Might think   Baby   It's bad out there   Say   What's in this drink?.We'll be your friend..And the only thing that I could see,   Was a pair of brown eyes they were looking at me..You'll find that life   Is still worth-while   If you just smile.I know girl it's a lot to ask!.What did I feel or think was true   I can't remember before loving you   You've shown me all that love can be   As beautiful as you are   It still amazes me..I said, ""I can play guitar   And it will be alright listen!"".It's just a memory you know   You can't dilute it   Or see to it   Roll through it   Head home..Green River I've come back to you do you remember me   Do you remember Molly with the soft blue eyes   I left here with a lot of dreams none of them came true   What I wanted was here waiting all the time   Green River did she come here every evening   Like the neighbors say she did so faithfully   Green River has she's gone away forever   She just disappeared one day as she gave upon me   Green River if you see her won't you tell her I'll return   All I've brought her is myself and this little dream   Please tell her that I love her and my lesson I have learned   Green River tell her please come back to me.I'm going to learn too..Only inside you the ghost of the love,   That is wordless and painful and old..In-a-gadda-da-vida, honey   Don't you know that I'll always be true?.I see the early glow, I hear you say hello   I watch the shadows fall, I don't see you at all   It's a lie (I don't believe it's so), it's a lie      I see the autumn rain, falling on my window pane   I hear you say goodbye, I see a tear in your eye      It's a lie (I don't believe it's so), it's a lie   Our love couldn't go wrong,   How could I know I was only dreaming   And now, now that you're gone,   I will go on really believing   I take the fall      I see you slip away, into another day   There's no-one else around,   I watch the sun go down      It's a lie (I don't believe it's so), it's a lie   Our love couldn't go wrong,   How could I know I was only dreaming   And now, now that you're gone,   I will go on really believing   I take the fall      I take the fall   I see you in a dream, you turn and start to go   I call to you once more, guess that I'm takin' the fall      It's a lie (I don't believe it's so), it's a lie   Our love couldn't go wrong,   How could I know I was only dreaming   And now, now that you're gone,   I will go on really believing   I take the fall      Our love couldn't go wrong, how could I know I was only dreaming   And now, now that you're gone, I will go on really believing   I take the fall"
"Browsing for a book at your local library that you've read, wanting to reread @CAPS1 to enjoy the sounds of its words again? You look shelf after shelf, not locating @CAPS1 anywhere. You searched everywhere, by everything that the book would possibly be listed under. You've browsed paper backs, hard backs; eventually letting your frustration take over.Giving up on locating the novel, you walk over to the librarian and ask about @CAPS1. She replies with, 'I'm sorry, we had to remove that particular novel due to a person finding @CAPS1 offensive to them.' You're infuriated, you decide to write a article to your local newspaper about the outrage of the books, movies, music, etc. that has been taken out of your local library.     Personally, I don't think that the media taken away from the library should be considered offensive. How can you consider what is offensive and what is not? A book could be offensive to one person, but not another. Different people have different opinions, and @CAPS1's not reasonable to remove a book or other type of media from a library because @CAPS1 contains 'offensive material.' @CAPS1's ridiculous; @CAPS1 infuriates me that someone would do that. If you think @CAPS1 could get into the hands of a child, or someone that @CAPS1 would effect, do not rent the item. That's why at most libraries, there are seperate areas for adults and children so that children don't obtain these items.     How can you determine if something is offensive? I personally don't find a lot of things offensive, but just because something is offensive to me, doesn't mean I will request to have @CAPS1 banned so that other people can't enjoy @CAPS1. If you find something offensive, just leave @CAPS1 alone. Don't bother, annoy, or hassle someone else that had nothing to do with its creation with @CAPS1. @CAPS1's not only disrepectful to the individual you file a complaint to, but the artist who created @CAPS1. You do have the right to voice your opinion, but sometimes, @CAPS1 doesn't have to voiced.     We live in such a closed-minded world. We have people who don't even think @CAPS1's approprite to show one's arm. I can see why some people take offense to these things, but honestly, @CAPS1's mediocre to report something just becuase you do not agree with @CAPS1. We have a vast knowledge of what's right or wrong, what is or is not appropriate for an audience to hear. If @CAPS1 weren't appropriate, you honestly think @CAPS1 would have been published? Sure there are things in book, music, etc. that are inappropriate, but to be so closed-minded to have something banned for use of foul language, minor sexual content, or violence is unlogical. You can find worse, hear worse, just by walking down the street just about anywhere.     To answer the question bluntly, no, I do not think that media should be banned just because @CAPS1 is offensive. We as @CAPS2 have the right to speak our voice, from two different perspectives. You can argue if something is mediocre, is offensive; I will argue back, just because I have the right to voice my opinion as you do. These reasons that enjoyable media are banned, such as language and violence, add emphasis, meaning, emotion, and make the reader dig for so much more in a book, song, etc. These are how the authors see their work, they want to show the people what they see, even if @CAPS1 does offend someone else..You got me worn out trying   (Ooh, baby blue)   (What can I do?).The day is ended little drummer

There would be cherubs with tiny harps arrows and bows   I'd have a halo and a flowing white robe   I'd be enfolded by a celestial light   If I'd lived right      But I'm feeling hot and bothered

edit these scenes out   It would be a PG instead of an X-rated life   If I'd lived right      Some would call me a cheat call me a liar   Say that I've been defeated by the basest desired   Yes I have strayed and succumbed to my vices   But I tried to live right      But I have no regrets no guilt in my heart   I only feel sadness for any pain that I've caused   I guess I wouldn't bother to worry at all   If I'd lived right      Do you live by the book do you play by the rules?.I aint gonna live-I don't believe I'm going to live to get much older..Don't you see respect is not a   One way

"Imagine that a person comes up to you and says, '@CAPS1 is that you are reading there? Wait, I know that book! That book is absolutely offensive! How dare you read that!' Then, imagine that they snatch that book up, and you never see it again. This is an example of how censorship works. If the government notices citizens in our country with offensive magazines, books, movies, or music, is it right for them to grab it away? No, not in any way do they have a right to do that!      Everybody should be able to decide for themselves @CAPS1 is right or wrong to; watch, read, or hear. Nobody has to be exposed to anything that they don't want to. Also, if a person truley wants to find an offensive form of entertainment, they will find it, no matter if it is legal to or not. Therefore, I believe that trying to stop people from this is a fruitless action.     Remember when you would get to listen to your favorite bedtime story, '@CAPS2 The @ORGANIZATION2'? Well, you can't read it anymore, the government declared the book offensive to camels and took it away. Now, you have only a boring book on facts about camels. @CAPS1 fun is that? And I have to think, '@CAPS1 about the authors?' @CAPS4 thing that is amazing about our country is our freedom of speech and expression! Stopping all that creativity from our author is tough and cruel. Writing a great story is near impossible to accomplish with limitaions that could result from government censorship.     If a song is beautiful and sweet, but contains @CAPS4 bad word in it, is it a bad song? If there was censorship, who would decide @CAPS1 is appropiate? Would the @CAPS5 decide for us? Or would the @ORGANIZATION1 get together and read aloud the books before they were declared inappropiate? Personally, I would love to decide for myself. And, as a mature adult, I can. I have the morals and the mind to choose for myself @CAPS1 is good or bad.     Perhaps, the multitude of books and songs that we have now would disappear altogether. It is possible. It is incredibly difficult to imagine the entire country having the same moral opinions on our entertainment. This could cause a number of entertainment forms to be eliminated. So, how can we create a standard to approve these forms of entertainment?     Understanding that there are young, fragile children, that are privy to all forms all public entertainment, some censorship @MONTH1 be required. However, I strongly believe that this should be limited. The censorship should be used only to help the kids. This is similar to the way a parent has their children eat healthy food instead of junk as they are growing up. When the kids are grown, they decide for themselves @CAPS1 food to eat. Some of the items I believe should be censored are; public commercials, children's television shows, and children's movies. The things I, and many others, believe should be censored are; profanity, violence, and offensiveness toward race, religion, and gender. Later, these children will be able to chose for themselves @CAPS1 they think is acceptable, and the censorship can end.     Total censorship is bad. Each and every citizen has the right to read whatever they please to. And nobody should ever try to take that away. Please, don't ever let people tell you your own morals..Ther'es a soft rain tappin' on your window   There's a cool breeze blowin' off the bay   And a warm flame dancin' with our shadows   To music playin' far away   I never meant to stay an hour   I thought that I was passing through   Another town along the highway   I never meant to fall for you      [Chorus]   But I can't speak for you Maria   I only know the way I feel   When I sleep with you, Maria   There's nothing left for dreams to steal      On a Bible by the mirror   The only treasures that we hold   The only secrets that we're keepin'   A watch, a chain, a cross of gold      [Chorus]      When the sunlight brings the mornin'   I can't tell you what I'll do   But I've a mind to take you with me   And I've got heart to stay with you      [Chorus]      When I sleep with you, Maria   There's nothin' left for dreams to steal.They came through the gate and across the lawn   Knocking down Edith's Tiki Torch..you're paying for it now   Wouldn't you expect more from a friend   You and I are not the same   To you love is just a game   Things will never be the same again      So now goodbye   This time I will be gone goodbye   Stayed for way too long   Started out with trust   But it isn't just about the good times baby      So now goodbye   This time I will be gone goodbye   I stayed for way too long   I don't need you now   And I am oh so tired of excuses baby      Goodbye   Goodbye   Goodbye   Goodbye      This time will be gone goodbye   Stayed for way to long this time   It all started out with trust   But it isn't about the good times baby      So now goodbye   This time I will be gone goodbye   I stayed for way too long   I don't need you now   And I am oh so tired of excuses baby.Frank butler:   But I must confess that I like it,   So there's nothing to be done..While visiting a funeral parlor,   Uncle Louie, he let out a holler..We've had it with your discipline..Expensive old wine, forty years lying,   Mice chewed the labels, don't know what we're buying..I've been waitin on the other side, for your friends to leave   So I don't have to hide, I prefer they didn't know   So I've been waiting on the other side, for your friends to go      I've been sliding down a slippery slope, I've been climbing   Up a slowly burning rope, but the flame is getting low   I've been waitin' on the other side, for your friends to go      You never need to worry about me, I'll be fine on my own   Someone else can worry about me   I've spent a lot of time on my own   I've spent a lot of time on my own      I've been waitin till the danger past, I don't know   How long the storm is gonna to last, if we're gonna carry on   I'll been waiting on the other side, till your friends are gone      So tell me what I want to know   I'll be waiting on the other side, for your friends to go      Someone else can worry about me   I've spent a lot of time on my own   I've spent a lot of time on my own      I've been waiting on the other side   For your friends to leave so I don't have to hide   I prefer they didn't know   So I've been waiting on the other side, for your friends to go      I've been waiting on the other side   I've been waiting on the other side, for your friends to go.I don't know why, I don't know why, I don't know why   I don't know how, I don't know how, I don't know how   Are my wings strong enough   Are my wings strong enough.I'm so cold   Don't leave me blind   I'm so cold   Don't leave me blinded.Yeah, yeah yeah yeah yeah, oh   Tell 'em about it   Romeo loved Juliet, Juliet she felt the same   When he put his arms around her, he said ""Julie baby you're my flame""   Thou givest fever, when we kisseth, fever with thy flaming youth   Fever - I'm afire, fever yea I burn forsooth..Is it me, is it you   Cold metal voice   Of no one's friend it could be mine   My reflection   Is no longer me at all   Am I a fake   Of the man and are you of me   Are you real?.Ha!.Hoooooooovvvvaaa   Could you even have any doubt   After doutbt it was ova..Will I hear you call my name?.You know, like electric chair   The way you stare (yeah I'm there)   You committed a crime and I'm the victim      I've got an eye out for she who cries out passionately   We'll do things backwardly, forwardly, horizontally   I'm too young to be settling down   quick to change my mind tomorrow   So now can I borrow your timid torso   More so than your soul, honest me gotta be how I roll   Fuck the rhythm, fuck the rhythm under your bosom   You're the prism, Shirley Chislom   Was the first, let's rehearse making a baby   Put in your order, I want a baby daughter   Dance on the tip of my tongue   Shake the clouds 'til there's no more wetness in them   Tell your home girls that you will send them   A postcard from 3000, hard!.For you know I'm not free and I never can be   And you're bound to get restless in time..Yeah...

"Many Libraries today have limits on what they can put on their shelves.  Yes, their is offensive material out there in the world but, its just artists triing to make a name for themselves.  If we start controlling each others thoughts, feelings, and artist ability where will that get our culture that is rapidly expanding?  Libraries should not have the right to censor material.      One way to appeal to everyones demands would be to divide the library into two major sections childrens and adults and then you could contiue dividing sections.  Doing this would be cost-effective and adding a   age limit in the adult section so no noisy children could get into there would be nice.  It would help making finding a book easier for finding that right book.     Censorship is defined as taking out a paticular item, thats either offensive to a certain group or is banned.  If someone took out @PERSON2's @PERSON3 statue and other peices of work, we wouldnt get where we would be today.  If you take out material you never know where it could go or lead someone.  Censorship holds back many artists true potential.  Limiting someones knowledge could hurt that persons chance at becoming something in this world.     I have read many books that are both offensive in ways and other books about knowledge and intelligence and their is no difference. Many things interest different people. The author Katherine Paterson's quote explains this all to well if someone has a right to remove a book from the shelf than everyone has a right to remove a material off a shelve and so there would be no books left.  Censoring something not only hurts the person who created it but hurts everyone else.     Libraries should not censorship any material. Censoring material hurts everyones yearn for a open mind or a better understanding of something.  As Katherine Paterson's quote goes 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none our children or any other children have taken off the shelf.  But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf---that work I abhor- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.'  @CAPS1 explains that if one person has a right to take a material off a shelf than everyone else has that right.   Censorship shouldnt be in libraries..Hey!.[Chorus]   We just picture thinking, dreaming, scheming, breathing, reading, all in the late night   Shaking, boiling, lacing, bacon, shaking, shaping, gotta get this cake right   As I serve it, you just burn it, breathe it, learn it, now watch you take flight   ...My nigga how does it feel?.Anytime you want me (anytime you want me),   Anytime you want me (anytime you need me),   Anytime you want me (anytime you want me now),   Oh oh oh, anytime you want me..Please come home.Broken windows   In empty hallways   Pale dead moon   And the sky streaked with grey   Human kindness overflowing   And I think it's gonna rain today      Scarecrows dressed in the latest styles   With frozen smiles to keep love away   Human kindness overflowing   And I think it's gonna rain today      Lonely, lonely   Tin can at my feet   I think I'll kick it down the street   That's the way to treat a friend      Right before me   The signs implore me   Help the needy   And show them the way   Human kindness, it's overflowing   And I think it's gonna rain today      Lonely, so lonely   Tin can at my feet   I think I'll kick it down the street   That's the way to treat a friend      Right before me   The signs implore me   Help the needy   And show them the way   Human kindness, it's overflowing   And I think it's gonna rain today.Flowers have blooms   The ocean has waves   The sky has clouds   People have babes   I want to live   Till I get old   I want to watch all of this grow   I want to live, live and let live   I want all the love this life has to give   I want to smile and be friendly with you   I want to live and let you live some too      Rover is big, Tabby is small   Betty is short, Jimmy is tall   They want to live, live and let live   They want all the love this life has to give   They want to smile and be friendly with you   They want to live and let you live some too   We want to live, but don't you.Decaffeinate, unleaded, keep all surfaces clean..Question for all you   Who should know   Much better   But don't..Ooo, yes I will..But I couldn't make it through until there was you..Every useful minute seems to be the thought of you   Every hour seems like wasted, filled with things that I might do   Without love in my reactions seems the saddest thing, but's true!.What about committing the same sin   over and over again and again and ah..

" Isn't there a saying in the world called its a free country? I thought it wasthere are alot of things that people should not see in the world. But we find ways to see it anyway no matter what it is the world has so many sources to get the truth or maybe even lie's to the world we live in. From the media to the press to poparasi maybe even from the people around you they all help the cause of things that should not be being seen by the people.          There thing's out there that we the people don't know nothing about that the goverment and world shields from our eyes. Then there's the things that we are showin by the world like @PERSON1 alot of people think what happend to him is offensive. Not only that but racisim in general also the news why would people put violent things on the news like murder storys and kidnapping and robberys and many more. People find that offensive and even scary to alot of people but yet we keep it on there.                                                                  So no i don't think it should not be removed from shelves and or were ever all things found to be offensive to people are located. Just like when that marine died and gay supportors and protestors were near his funeral chanting with (offensive) thing's. Say thank god for dead soldiers and god hates the army. Nobody stopped that. If we as people are not going to come togeather and work with one another about the things that should or should not be displayed then whats the point of telling someone else what is offensive to you when your going to end up doing it to. And your going to do it with out a care in the world not thinking about who your hurting . Everyone has and opinion and wants to demained it but people are diffrent and some will always see it diffrent than what you see it.                                                       So if you see something offensive in a book or movie or outside. Dont watch it dont read it dont try to hear about it from a friend or stranger leave it alone. We put so much effort into hearing about these offensive things when all you had to do was leave it alone. And then you wouldnt have even known about it. Live life and dont worry about the negative lets focus on the positive of what you see..Oh, and it makes me stop and   Wonder why   People give their hearts and turn   around and say goodbye   If there's something on your mind   You better say it while there's time   'Cause I'm leavin' when I see that   Morning sky..Check it...uggh!.Sing sweet and low your lullaby   till angels say, ""Amen."".Hey, what d'ya say?.You gave me life,   Gave me your heart   Your shoulder when I needed to cry   You gave me hope when all my hope is gone   Wings so my dreams can fly   And I haven't told

the bedroom is one large ice cube,   And she squeezes the toothpaste from the middle of the tube..It was just another Saturday   And ev'rything was in the key of A..And I don't want to know about evil   I only want to know about love   I don't want to know about evil   Only want to know about love..The luring eyes, you had never seen..Just dance?.In a dream we are lying on the top of a hill   And headlights slide past the moon   I roll in your arms   And your voice is the heat of the night   I'm on fire      In a phone booth   In some local bar and grill   Rehearsing what I'll say, my coin returns   How the heart approaches what it yearns   How the heart approaches what it yearns.Till you know my hidden shame you really don't know me      I had a friend when I was just a boy   We were like brothers, we would run and hide   And we went walking on a high hillside   And I really don't how it happened      He turned to me and had this strange look in his eye   And not a single word was spoken   I must have pushed him but I don't remember why   And all at once, he lay there broken   And I walked down without him and I didn't even sigh      Hidden shame, shame, shame that I can't get free   From the blame and the torture and the misery   Must it be my secret for eternity?.I'm walking away from you   Don't want to be abused   Doberman eyes   Eagle claws   And your snake body says

 How and pre-destiny      And it's getting agonizing to hang out   With grown adults who actually believe   Mythology and history   Trump physics and science   My aversion has turned to abhorrence.I must follow love, follow love..So you make a little money   Off of somebody else's sweat   So some people starve a little   While you get fat   While you get fat   So you grind and grind   And you push and shove   And claim that those most worthy   Will get what they deserve   What they deserve      It can't be true   It can't be true   Because I've seen too many hungry faces   I've seen too many with the likes of you   It can't be true      For you everything has it's price   You give nothing away for free   If silence were truly golden   I guess no one could sleep   No one could sleep      You have money at your fingertips   People at your beck and call   And you're fool enough   To think for a price   You can have the whole wide world      For all our sake's   And all our lives   We must hope the words   That come from your lips   We must hope those words are lies      For all our sake's   And all our lives   We must hope the dreams   Soulless visions that you have   Are never realized      So   You've got a big house   And you drive a fancy car   So what if your pockets are full   If you have an empty heart      You snap your fingers   And all the waters part   So what if the people bow down   If they show you no regard      Your left hand   Always watches your right   So what if you trust in god   If you can't sleep at night      You think you've made it   You think you've got what everyone wants   So what if you're a big fat man   With an empty little heart      Who has made a little money   Off of somebody else's sweat   Who watched the people starve   While you got fat   While you got fat   You got fat   You got fat.I'm rude and I'm shrewd, I'm fat and I'm bad..I'm the one who'll never hurt you, maybe it's because I love you..Somewhere beyond the sea   She's there watching for me,   If I could fly like birds on high   Then straight to her arms I'd go sailing."
"Censorship in libraries should not be allowed. I believe that even if books, music, movies or magazines on the bookshelves are offense, they should still be left there. They are apart of our history and the history we're creating.     If anyone wants to read a certain book or magazine, there's a big chance they will end up reading it. There are so many ways to get to those things with the technology we have today. You could just look them up online and read them or listen to them off the computer.     Also, censoring in libraries, where everyone feels tranquil and comfortable, can make people rebel and even put the library out of business.     From what i've observed, most people look up inappropriate or offensive things on the internet already. Especially if they know that it's something that could be debated about being censored.     A lot of books and movies, great ones even, contain some offensive content but they are classics. Generations, one after the other, have enjoyed them.     Now tell me, who would want to be the unreasonable person and take that away from anyone who is interested? Everyone should have the right to these books, magazines, movies, and music. Libraries should not censor them..Che canzone canterai?.(Early in the morning)   Shake!.DJ I want everybody to stop what they're doing..(Go on tell 'em)   Oh they don't know?.Its all been saved   with exception for the right parts   When will we be new skin?.He had a big adventure   Amidst the grass   Fresh air at last..they're coming!.Who loves the sun   Who cares that it makes plants grow   Who cares what it does   Since you broke my heart      Who loves the wind   Who cares that it makes breezes   Who cares what it does   Since you broke my heart      Pa Pa Pa Pa   Who loves the sun   Pa Pa Pa Pa   Who loves the sun   Pa Pa Pa Pa   Not everyone   Pa Pa Pa Pa   Who loves the sun      Who loves the rain   Who cares that it makes flowers   Who cares that it makes showers   Since you broke my heart      Who loves the sun   Who cares that it is shining   Who cares what it does   Since you broke my heart      Pa Pa Pa Pa   Who loves the sun   Pa Pa Pa Pa   Who loves the sun   Pa Pa Pa Pa   Not everyone   Pa Pa Pa Pa   Who loves the sun   Sun   Sun   Sun      Pa Pa Pa Pa   Who loves the sun   Pa Pa Pa Pa   Who loves the sun   Pa Pa Pa Pa   Not just anyone.The rhythm, the rhythm, the rhythm, the rhythm   The rhythm, the rhythm, the rhythm, the rhythm   The rhythm, the rhythm, the rhythm, the rhythm   The rhythm, the rhythm, the rhythm, the rhythm   The rhythm, the rhythm, the rhythm, the rhythm   The rhythm, the rhythm, the rhythm, the rhythm   The rhythm, the rhythm, the rhythm, the rhythm      The rhythm of legs moving in the sun   The rhythm of an engine deep and throating   The rhythm of a summer that you walked in      The sound of a barking dog on a loop   A plane rises in the crystal blue   The rhythm of keys swinging in your hand   The rhythm of light coming out of your fingers      Heaven, heaven   Heaven, heaven   Heaven, heaven   Can you feel it?.[Chorus:]      Here we go (all night long)   Sister, sister (all night long)   In the playpen...woo...(all night long)   Little baby goes, ha!.Now that I have found you   In the cool'th of your evening smile   The shade of your parasol   And your love flows through me   Though I drink at your pool   I burn for you, I burn for you      You and I are lovers   When night time folds around our bed   In peace we sleep entwined   And your love flows through me   Though an ocean soothes my head   I burn for you, I burn for you      Stars will fall from dark skies   As ancient rocks are turning   Quiet fills the room   And your love flows through me   Though I lie here so still   I burn for you, I burn for you      I burn.The machines screamed from   Moon to sun..How bout now?...The lights are on but you're not home   Your mind is not your own   Your body sweats, your body shakes   Another kiss is what it takes   You can't eat, you can't sleep   There's no doubt you're in deep   Your throat is tight, you can't breathe   Another kiss is all you need      You like to think that you're immune to the stuff, oh yeah   It's closer to the truth, you know   You're gonna have to face it   You might as well face it, you're addicted to love      You see the signs but you can't read   You're running at a different speed   Your heart beats at double time   Another kiss and you'll be mine   One-track mind, you can't be saved   Another young love is all you crave   And if the sun left you   You don't mind if you do      You like to think that you're immune to the stuff oh yeah   It's closer to the truth, you see   You're gonna have to face it   You're gonna have to face that you're addicted to love      You might as well face it, you're addicted to love.Yo, man that's my wife!"".O free the world from blindness   And fill the world with kindness   Give sinners resurrection   Bring striving to perfection..Medal of honor, I'm feelin' on top like Pac   When he slept with Madonna   Hey, this is death before dishonor   Get arrested and forget to tell my mama   She got enough to stress about   My nigga gonna get me out   Then we hit the club with the thugs and the liquors   No criminal record but I'm makin' criminal records   Isn't it ironic?.[Peeper slamming into cp car seat]      Peeper: handcuffed...

"Libraries are full of all different sorts of books, movies and magazines.  These books, movies, and magazines @MONTH1 come across as offensive to some people. Parents might not want their children to see certain books or movies. Does this mean we should take thoughs offensive books off the shelf?      If everyone decided to take one book or movie they think was inappropriate off the shelf, there would be nothing left in the library. Books contain adventures and life lessons that kids and adults need. Young Children need books to help their imagination grow.  If there was not anymore books in the library, children would not be able to learn or grow. Movies are just like books but for young children it is easier to visualize a movie rather then a book. If the book or movie is found offensive to you, pick another, but it should not be removed from the shelf.  One book or movie @MONTH1 seem offensive to you, but @MONTH1 not to another person.     A world without books. No imagination. No adventures. It would be a boring world.  I would rather have a few offensive books then none at all. That way I can learn and see character's adventures through my own eyes.A place where sin cannot molest,   Near to the heart of God..I try to be innocent   I try to be rough   But I just wanna play

As the flames, climbed into the clouds   I wanted to fix this   But couldn't stop from tearing it down   And you were there at the turn   Caught in the burning glow   And I was there at the turn   Waiting to let you know      We're building it up   To break it back down   We're building it up   To burn it down   We can't wait   To burn it to the ground      You told me yes   You held me high   And I believed when you told that lie   I played soldier, you played king   And struck me down, when I kissed that ring   You lost that right, to hold that crown   I built you up, but you let me down   So when you fall, I'll take my turn   And fan the flames   As your blazes burn      And you were there at the turn   Waiting to let me know      We're building it up   To break it back down   We're

"Remain on the Shelf?     Certain materials such as books, music, magazines and more can often contian offensive information that many would want censored. The people writing the items are not making them so that they are just plain offensive, the way people take in information is the main factor. People choose whether or not to believe certain things for themselves, and with those come their personal opinions. Books and magazines should not be removed from shelves if they are found offensive, this could create more problems with the public and those who disagree on what has been taken out, that dont consider them to be offensive.     What is offensive to one person, @MONTH1 not be offensive to the next. Items being removed because of a complaint made by one person should not even be considered. Whether it be a book, magazine, or music the author had a purpose for it and it was not intended on hurting someone's feelings. For example, a book about slavery could be offensive to a white man, but a black man would consider it to be about his history. People can find many things offensive by just reading titles, or listening to one lyric from as song, but that does not mean they have to read the book or keep listening to the song. Someone else is enjoying the book and the song could be what another person looks forward to everyday.     These magazines and books could also be seen as informing. The material in a certian magazine @MONTH1 not be acceptable by some, but a lot of new information can come from them. If everything found offensive was removed from the shelves there would most likley be nothing left. Removing them could cause choas to someone who is trying to learn more about a disease, when another person who is suffering from it does not want their story told. Certian materials being offensive can only offend so many, and chances are what doesnt offend them offends the next person. Informing articles and books should not be removed from shelves in libraries because they are there just to provide a source of knowledge.     Censoring in libraries would also take away from those who are just interested. A lot of people like to read and rent movies just for fun, but chances are if the book or movie does not sound interesting, it is not going to make any profit. What is considered offensive to a person could be the interest of another. From my experience teenagers are interested in alot of action and romantic films and books. They often times contain alot of physical and sexual content along with a decnt amount of foul language. A older person would not be interested in the foul language and content, they would consider them to be offensive to either the girl or boy in the story and would wonder why it is even being read. Most would even say that the books and movies can be degrading to some, but it is what interests teens and makes them want to read more becasue they can't wait to see what is going to happen next. Removing items such as these would push teens away from reading and viewing alot of movies because nothing then would spark their interest.     Scenes and facts in materials that could be offensive to a person are usually not intended to be. People are not being made to read and watch what offends them. Everybody is different and what offends my neighbor @MONTH1 not offend me. Chances are that there will alwasy be something that is going to offend at least one person. The more we all get used to it , the less many people will actually run into items that offend them. They @MONTH1 still be offended on the insided but it won't matter because they will have realized that not everybody is offended by the same thing.He opened up my guitar..I'm a woman   W-O-M-A-N.

"Many people think that libraries should be censored in one form or another to keep certian types of book away from people. How does that really help? Even if you remove certian book or music from a library doesn't mean people won't still get that same information from somewhere else. Besides many of the things that people should be censored is probably not that bad. I think it is better for some one to read about somthing the have it happen to them and then experince it. Like Katherine Paterson said if we let people get rid of book of music that they think are bad for people to read or listen to what will we have left. Nothing! Through people think censorring libraries is for the greater good, it just has too many bad side to have much of a good effect.     When people try to censor things they normally just take things off of shelfs and get rid of them. But, in today world of technology that doesn't stop people from obtaining there goal. We have the internet that lets people upload book and music to share. So yeah, you many not be able to get a book at the library but you can almost always find it online. In result trying to censor libraries by removing books and music really is doing anything.     How do you determine what should be censored? People all have a different idea of what is ok for the public and what is not. Some book that get removed could insult a group of people because it related in some way to them. Then you loss business and make poeple mad at the same time. In some way isn't it better for people to learn about bad things like crime and death through ways that aren't real and don't hurt. When things like that happen in a book they normally don't just stop there. They show the results or how the situation was handled. Which could come to help people who end up in the same sort of situatuions later on it there life. Which makes it really hard to determine what should be censored and what shouldn't.     Katherrine Paterson even said that if we let people censor what they think is unmoral nothing will be left. Everything will be gone, because every person in the world would find something is every book that they could find bad. Even if there is a book that people agree should be censored, there are people that think the other way. No books would be left if we  censored libraries because people could find thing bad or unmoral in every book.      Overall, censoring libraries ends up being more pain than it worth. It is not stoping people from obtaining the information another way. There is no way to decide what shuld be censored. And, censoring somethings will lead to people wanting other things to be censored, which will leave nothing. In conclusion, censoring doesn't really stop people and ends up leading to bigger problems in the end..Lady of the Dawn, you opened up my sleeping eyes,   I never lnew that I was born..Oh, when I get back on solid ground   I'm gonna crawl my way to you..[Verse Three (Tiny):]   Once the sun comes out,   And the rain is gone away,   I know I'm gonna see a better day..""Abigail, I know You're in control of her brain, Abigail   And I know that You're the one that's   speaking through her, Abigail   Miriam can You hear me""      ""I am alive inside Your Wife   Miriam's dead, I am her head."".(x2)      God it feels...

"In this essay I am going to write about the books about the librabries. Also if they are books that can be offensive and that it can or not be removed by the libraries.I think that the libraries have the right to have any materials such as books, music, movies, magazines, and more on the shelves. Well in my opinion I think that they should not remove any books because people @MONTH1 think that it can be offensive but other people @MONTH1 be into those books. So no I don't think they should remove any because some people have different opinions on different books.When I go to libraries they are books that I can enjoy reading or not like but that is just my opinion. Some people might like the book that I did not liked or hate but I think that the books should not be removed from the shelves because some people might enjoy it and some won't.I think they should not remove books because the books are for people that are interseted on the books that they want to read or learn about the stuff about the past or just fiction books.I just talked about the essay I just wrote I talked about the books about the libraries, and how some books can be offensive to other people that are trying to pick books, and also if they should or not remove books from the shelves.If you can heal the symptoms   But not affect the cause   It's quite a bit like trying to heal   The gunshot wound with gauze   If you instead attempt to rest   The pistol from the hand   Then I would not be able to   Equate my life with sand      Flowing through the hourglass   Pushing through the funnel   Turn once more and racing   All your siblings for the tunnel   Slide and let the silicone   Embrace you as you fall   Then bounce around   And let your brothers   Crush you to the wall      I would choose my own religion   Worship my own spirit   But if he ever preached to me   I wouldn't want to hear it   I'd drop him a forgotten god   Languishing in shame   And then if I hit stormy seas   I'd have myself to blame      If you can heal the symptoms,   But not affect the cause   You can't heal the symptoms.Yes, my baby's a country girl,   And she just can't help herself..[Chorus:]   [Puff over chorus]   No matter how bad it gets..Ya, yeah (YEAH!.I went to Long John's office..I [A] travelled from [A7] Texas to [D] old Louis-[A] anne   Through valleys, o'er mountains and [E7] plains   Both [A] footsore and [A7] weary I [D] rested a-[A] while   On The [E7] Banks Of The Old Ponchar-[A] train..Watching the trees go by   My baby, at the end of the depot(?

"Censorship is a tough topic to discuss. Everyone has different views on what is and isn't acceptable in libraries, because of the content in some books, music, movies, and magazines. When you start to censor what information is available to certain people, they get angry, and it can cause an uproar of protest. There should be an age limit on some materials however. So how can you tell what is okay for younger children and teens to view?     For movies, music, and magazines, there are already limitations on how old you have to be to buy or rent them. With movies, the rule in libraries should be the same as anywhere else. It should be that you must be seventeen to get anything rated @CAPS1. I'm not sure what the age is to view unrated movies is, but for libraries it shoulld be the same as anything else. Anything else, should be open to all ages.     Music is also a controversial material to censor. If a @CAPS2 has an explicit label on it, you should have to be eighteen to check it out. The reason being, is that some music can contain violent lyrics, and unless you are eighteen you shouldn't listen to it. When you hear music that is offensive to you, you must be smart enough to not listen to it. Anything any artist wants to say on a @CAPS2 can be recorded, and children should not be exposed to that until they are responsible enough to know what they should, and sometimes shouldn't be listening to.     Printed materials are the hardest to censor. Personally, i don't believe any book should be kept from anyone. The only type of book that should be kept from some people is magazines. Once again, magazines can contain some graphic content, and should only be kept from anyone under eighteen. There are just some things kids shouldn't see, but if you are a legal adult, and want to read any kind of book, it should be available to you.     With any of these materials, it should all be available to you in a library. It is a place to learn about how a writer, a movie director, a music artist, or magazine editor feels about the world. If we censor the material in a library, it is denying the public of the real world. Also, we would be revoking the right given to us of free speech. I do not make fun of books because I know whatever someone writes down, in their eyes, is the truth. It is an expression of self, and to stop someone's work from being available to the world, you are taking away the right of free speech..Right now the only thing that my mind ever holds,   Are long dark silences or screaming that explodes,   Burning rocking beds with visions of a land,   Long dark tunnels, questions and calm,   But, with you, you know I have no doubts,   And fear will have no sting,   With your brilliant eyes and your lost and broken wing,   My head upon your shoulder as you take me in your arms,   Continents will crumble, we will find no harm..When you tell me that you're leaving   And that you've got to be alone   Sometimes you seem to me like you're far away   In some different danger zone   I couldn't stop you if I wanted   You found somebody else for sure   What

"Cursing, violence, gang activity, murder, ect. All of these  are factors found in our books and music we have today. Do you believe these items should be cencered? If books or music have these types of messages in them it is going to influence children and adult's choices on what they do in life. I feel that, yes books and music should be cencored.          My first supporting reason of why books and music should be cencored is the fact that children and adults get a huge influence from the information. Look in today's world; murders are happening, gang violence, and even abuse. If a book or song is advertising about murdering some one, or selling drugs nine times out of ten people think that is the 'cool' thing to do so why not do it. With people following uncencored books and songs it leaves dead people, inmates, and poor choices. Most people want to follow what an artist or author is doing because they are famous, which is causing peer preasure.     The second reason books and music should be censored is the simple fact of respect. Some books or music affends people by their race, religion, or their apperance. You find most of the critizisium from music more than books, but it does occur. Young children and teens shouldn't listen to or read about racism, sex, how to drugs, ect. Books and music that have advertisment about these types of things is disrespectful to parents and what they teach their children. The message brought from the book or song is basically saying go against your parents and do this. A person should be able to sit and listen to a nice song, or book without getting disrespected and offended.     My final reasoning for books and music being cencored is the reputation it will have or has. Books and music are just like people, they can send off the wrong message leaving a bad reputation upon others. For instance, @CAPS1 @CAPS2 and @CAPS3 tend to have a lot of bad messaged songs, so therefore most people think that all @CAPS3 and @CAPS1 @CAPS2 are bad. If songs and books were cencored there wouldn't be a sterio type against a certain type of music, or books have the best message. A normal person bases the first song, or book they hear/read by if or not they or their child can listen to or read that type of material.      Love, positive messages, influencing good, these are the types of things most people want to hear or read. If books and music are cencored there will not be any more cursing on the radio, bad ideas given to those influenced, and could stop less violence. Again I state, yes I feel books and music should be cencored..It's not all in vain,   Because up the road is eternal gain..I am the dreamer, you are the dream   You are the answer to my fantasy   All

invitations to teenage parties   ""Dress in white"" one said, with quotations   From someone's wife, a famous writer   In the nineteen-twenties   When you're young you find inspiration   In anyone who's ever gone   And opened up a closing door   She said: ""We were never feeling bored      'Cause we were never being boring   We had too much time to find for ourselves   And we were never being boring   We dressed up and fought, then thought: ""Make amends""   And we were never holding back or worried that   Time would come to an end""      When I went I left from the station   With a haversack and some trepidation   Someone said: ""If you're not careful   You'll have nothing left and nothing to care for   In the nineteen-seventies""   But I sat back and looking forward   My shoes were high and I had scored   I'd bolted through a closing door   I would never find myself feeling bored      'Cause we were never being boring   We had too much time to find for ourselves   And we were never being boring   We dressed up and fought, then thought: ""Make amends""   And we were never holding back or worried that   Time would come to an end   We were always hoping that, looking back   You could always rely on a friend      Now I sit with different faces   In rented rooms and foreign places   All the people I was kissing   Some are here and some are missing   In the nineteen-nineties   I never dreamt that I would get to be   The creature that I always meant to be   But I thought in spite of dreams   You'd be sitting somewhere here with me      'Cause we were never being boring   We had too much time to find for ourselves   And we were never being boring   We dressed up and fought, then thought: ""Make amends""   And we were never holding back or worried that   Time would come to an end   We were always hoping that, looking back   You could always rely on a friend      And we were never being boring   We had too much time to find for ourselves   And we were never being boring   We dressed up and fought, then thought: ""Make amends""   And we were never being boring   We were never being bored   'Cause we were never being boring   We were never

"Can you think of a book that you hope none of your children or any other children have taken off the shelf? But if you had the right to remove the book would you? I believe if I found a book, magazine, any type of  music, or a movie offensive I would not remove it, because everyone has a right to their own opinion, even if it is offensive. Also, instead of removing the materials completely, why not remake them into a more suitable manner to where they are less offensive.     First, noone should have the right to remove materials they find offensive. Because if people were allowed to do that the world would have no music, books, movies, magazines or anything to intertain ourselves. Also it would start a big fight because alot of people do not find certain things offensive like other people do, and when the people that find materials offensive start removing things that other people dont find offensive, a big riot will start.     secondly, why would you start removing materials if it could be remade into a more suitable manner? maybe instead of removing everything, why not find the publisher and see if the could make it @NUM1 or less vaulger. Same with music, movies, and magazines.     So to conclusion everyone has a right to their own opinion, no matter if it is offensive or not. I think if i came across something that offended me I wouldnt do anything about it. Because maybe that person who wrote the book, or movie was expressing how they feel, and you can not tell someone how to feel or express themselves. So instead of removing materials off shelves consider that someone was just expressing how they feel and have the right to their own opinion just like you do.Hold me tight, and don't let go..Cabron   Tiki tiki tiki tiki,   Waddup Holmes?.Via cos?.Call it a day..One day you'll remeber this   One day when we reminisce   Nothing I do ever is, good enough for the music biz.You better think twice before you come at me   Right through your dome I can clearly see   Hey little dog, you gonna bark all day?.I get the strangest feeling you belong      Why does it always rain on me?.I once held her in my arms   She said she would always stay   But I was cruel and treated her like a fool   I threw it all away      One side's mountains in the palm of my hand   Rivers that ran through everyday   Now I must've been mad or I never knew what I had   I threw it all away      Love is all there is   And it makes the world go round   Love and only love it can't be denied   No matter what you think about it   You won't be able to live without it   Take a tip from one who's tried      So if you find someone   Who gives you all of their love   Take it to your heart   Don't let it stray   Because one thing is for certain   You'll surely be hurting   If you thow it all away   Just don't throw it all away.Oh god!.An airplane is in the evening wind on board lies also a man with child you sit certainly sit warmly and go are   Is so the sleep into the yarn in three hours it there to the Wiegenfeste the mama the visibility good the sky   Clear      Further, further into the ruining we must live die until we the person belongs not into the air so the   Gentleman in the sky calls it's sons on the wind bring me this person child      The child still has the time lost jumps there an echo to ears a grudge dull drives the night and the clouds   Driver laughs shakes awake the person freight      Further, further into the ruining we must live die until we and speaks hear is wants me the child to the   Father you then the thunder not that the king of all winds he to it's child      End the clouds tropft a choir creeps come are come are itself into the little ear here, shelter here we well   To you here, shelter here we brothers you      The storm embraced the flight machine the pressure a steam grudge fells drives screams quickly in the cabin   The night in panic the Menschefracht      Further, further into the ruining we must live die implores bring us until we and to the gentleman God the   Child sky himm back the wind intact to earths      End the clouds tropft a choir creeps come are come are itself into the little ear here, shelter here we well   To you here, shelter here we brothers you      The father does not comply pressed knows presses sets the child now firmly it very with itself noted its   Breath need yet the anxiety no pity so the father with the arms the soul out of the child this on the wind and   Sings      Come, shelter here we are come are well to you here, shelter here we brothers you.Back in the garage with my bullshit detector   Carbon monoxide making sure it's effective   People ringing up making offers for my life   But I just want to stay in the garage all night      We're a garage band   We come from garageland      Meanwhile things are hotting up in the West End alright   Contracts in the offices, groups in the night   My bummin' slummin' friends have all got new boots   An' someone just asked me if the group would wear suits      I don't want to hear about what the rich are doing   I don't want to go to where the rich are going   They think they're so clever, they think they're so right   But the truth is only known by guttersnipes      There's twenty-two singers!.Give us Jah victory again and again..You can find out what time that bus leaves for Cincinnati..To love is what I do best   You'll always be better than the rest   It won't be easy finding someone new   'Coz there's no other one like you   The night goes on, and I still think of you from dusk 'till dawn   I love you so, don't know how I'm ever gonna let you      (Repeat Chorus)      Baby I hope you know I love you   With all my heart and soul   If you open your eyes, look into my heart   You'll see the love in store for you      (Instrumental)   (Repeat Chorus 'till it fades).What was that promise that you made?.Most of us only care about money-makin..Cause anything is possible      Please come free my mind....In the port of Amsterdam..Ain't that loving you baby?.However, I'm informed by my disk jockey friends -

"I believe that there should be censorship in public libraries. Libraries have families and young children going to them that do not need to see, hear, and read certain things. If people would like to buy inapporpriate reading material, movies, or music they can do that elsewhere. Certain things are acceptable in public libraries and other things are not.     Certain material such at rated @CAPS1 movies and romance novels are not inappropriate or unacceptable. They are meant for adults but they are not showing extremely racy pictures on their covers. Other material, however, most people are not interested in having to see and our young children should not be subjected to that.     People that wish to view, listen to, or read inappropriate material that is not meant for all ages or covers shouldn't even be viewed by young children can and will purchase or find them elsewhere. People that wish to possess these items will find another place to get them besides a public place with families and children. I believe these people reserve the right to view and listen to what they would like but they should be censored in a public library.     Most people don't read inappropriate material in public and most extremely racy movies aren't even shown in theatres so why should you be able to check them out in a public place? Besides that many people do not even want other people to know that they are viewing these objects in the first place so many wouldn't even check them out at a public library.     I also believe that not only should children not be subjected to these things but parents should not be subjected to their children wanting to know what certain things are that they are far to young to know about.     The youth of @LOCATION1 is getting into new things younger and younger daily whether that be drugs or inappropriate magazines so I believe that we should not begin subjecting our children to that at an even younger age than they will already find out about it..[Chorus:].And the crowd, feeling proud to spend all day out there..'Cause I am nothing without you..You got me right on the Borderline..Barbra   Tell me every little thing..Since she tried to go too deep   Limitations brought her down   And though I'd like to free her mind   Visitations bring a frown   I gotta find the place she found   You can't measure the cost of a woman lost   But it's a heavy loss to bear when she's not there..Tell me I'm not sixteen!.At a fork in the road   Should I stay or should I go?.We'll soon be walkin' free there,   But 'til that day arrives,   At least we won't be travellin' alone...

new ways ever free   Those whose promises stretched in hope and grace for me""      I bless you madly,   Sadly as I tie my shoes   I love you badly, just in time,   At times, I guess   Because of you I need to rest, oh yes   Because it's you   That sets the test      So much has gone   And little is new   And as the sunrise stream   Flickers on me,   My friends talk   Of glory, untold dream, where all is God and God is just a word      ""We had a friend, a talking man   Who spoke of many powers that he had   Not of the best of men, but ours      We used him   We let him use his powers   We let him fill our needs   Now we are strong      And the road is coming to its end   Now the damned have no time to make amends   No purse of token fortune stands in our way   The silent guns of love   Will blast the sky   We broke the ruptured structure built of age   Our weapons were the tongues of crying rage      Where money stood   We planted seeds of rebirth   And stabbed the backs of fathers   Sons of dirt      Infiltrated business cesspools   Hating through our sleeves   Yea, and we slit the Catholic throat   Stoned the poor   On slogans such as      'Wish You Could Hear'   'Love Is All We Need'   'Kick Out The Jams'   'Kick Out Your Mother'   'Cut Up Your Friend'   'Screw Up Your Brother or He'll Get You In the End'      And we know the flag of love is from above   And we can force you to be free   And we can force you to believe""      And I close my eyes and tighten up my brain   For I once read a book in which the lovers were slain   For they knew not the words of the Free States' refrain   It said:   ""I believe in the power of good   I believe in the state of love   I will fight for the right to be right   I will kill for the good of the fight for the right to be right""      And I open my eyes to look around   And I see a child laid slain   On the ground   As a love machine lumbers through desolation rows   Plowing down man, woman, listening to its command   But not hearing anymore   Not hearing anymore   Just the shrieks from the old rich      And I want to believe   In the madness that calls 'Now'   And I want to believe   That a light's shining through   Somehow      And I want to believe   And you want to believe   And we want to believe   And we want to live   Oh, we want to live      We want to live   We want to live   We want to live   We want to live   We want to live      I want to live   I want to live   I want to live      I want to live   I want to live   I want to live      Live   Live   Live.For with dreams you learn to take your

"'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf- that work I abhor- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' @CAPS1 the author, Katherine Paterson. Her quote means that there might be a book, magazine, etc., on a shelf that someone shouldn't see. I beleive that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., shouldn't be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive. There are ways people can avoid seeing them. I think that if something is found offensive then they should be in a special aisle.     First off, if there are items that people find offensive then they should be placed in a specific aisle. There are things that only adults should see so therefore there should be an aisle dedicated to the offensive or inapropriate things. And for someone to get into that aisle they should have permission to get into the aisle and show and I.D. so that kids and children don't accidently slip in and see things they shouldn't. Because if a child sees something bad, then that might influence them to do bad things because they won't know any better.     Secondly, if an indivual finds a book or magazine offensive, then they can avoid it by simply walking away. That person doesn't have to read it or look for it in a library if it's in a certain aisle. But if someone is really offended by something then all they have to do is go complain to the person head of the library and it can simply be removed if there are enough compaints. Then again, it's not that hard to avoid something you don't like. It might bother you that it's there, but it should be out of the way for younger kids to see.     Thirdly, the library will contain things that are found either offensive or inapropriate so children entering the library should have adult supervision so that they don't see the bad things. If a child sees something bad, they might find it interesting so they might want to pick it up and read it, which is bad because it might give them ideas.     Finally, there are many ways to avoid seeing something you find offensive. You can walk away if you notice something you find offensive or you stay away from that area of the library. There are going to be many things out there that people find offensive and inapropriate, but there's not much you can do about it. The best thing to do is ignore it and walk away. And if you're that concerned about it then you can always make a complaint about what has offended you or what you think is inapropriate for children. Putting bad things in an aisle is a smart idea because little kids won't be able to access it..Commando girls you'll never never catch them crying!.This ones for you Curtis, I love you..I wanna be

"As a fellow person of the community and a person who often vists the libray, I think that books,magazines,movies,etc., should not be taken off the shelf. The reason for this thought is because, although it @MONTH1 be offensive to one person does not mean it's offensive to another. Taking various books and items away from our libraries takes away from many peoples' knowledge of our world. This in turn makes the world illiterate.     Libraries provide multiple things that are not family disscreation but, to the right age group offers alot of knowledge. Movies are a large portion of this problem but, they are there do to entertainment  reasons. I feel that all items that are equipped in a library should be looked at as a way of knowledge and not as weither it is offensive to a certain quanity of people. The removal of these things @MONTH1 become harmful to a new generation in the long run.     I personally think as a person who attends the library often, that things being taken away cause uproar in different ways.  I have read multiple books that have been aquired from all different sections of the library. Some even pertainig to racism of my own ethinticity that uses words that are not to my liking. I tolerate with the words do to the fact that I would like to know what my ancestory had to do in order for me to get where I am today.             Magazines are also a small portion of this conflict. As like movies though they are there to provide entertainment. Most people like to use the library for a time of relaxtion. The library is not just there for people to take books and other things it also there so that people can have a comfortable place to learn something.      In conclusion, As a fellow person of the community and a frequent library attende, I think that things should not be taking off of shelves. Libraries provides various things that are not at a family disccreation level but, @MONTH1 provide help to other people. Some books pertain to racism of ethnitcity. It's not meant to be harmful but to show what your ancestor had to endure to get your where you are. Things like magazines are there for your entertainment and if you think it's inappropriate then you should'nt read or watch it..Misdemeanor on the M.

"The shelf is an object that holds many types of diffierent materials such as movies, books, magazines, and music. Its all media and entertainment. But not everyone likes the media because one or all of these materials @MONTH1 be offensive towards the foriegn and children.     Censorship in our libraries could get a little graphic and such. Yes we all the it in movies and music, but we do not want it in our libraries. A library is a place for study and learning for educational purposes. There are not for entertainment and things of that nature. Sometimes they could be a little fun but for the most part, people would like to take there children and show them something to help there minds focus on school. By all @CAPS1 rated @CAPS2 movies, dirty music, adult books and magzines should be taken off the shelves.      One day as I was in the state library looking on the shelves for a book on @LOCATION1 and its people. As I was reading the book, it said some very mean and offensive things about the @CAPS3 people. I thought to myself that this book should be takken of the shelves forever and never seen again. It shocked me that someone would put that book in a public library and let the foreign and others read it. After some people read about the @CAPS3 people; They had second thoughts and started get angey and disliking them for theses things and offensive comments made!     Magazines and movies should be taken of the shelves in the catagories in my opinion of the poeple in different countries and the way they live. That could be very sad for someone because they could of really went through everything in that movie or what ever that magzines says. Another reason censorship should be under control is the titles to these materials. If a child looks at an adult film and it happens to be for a child, wouldnt you think thats a little offensive? I know I would. There is no way I want my child watching some violet movie.      We have to think for our children and the people that come in form different countries when it comes to public libraries. If censorship is not observed carfully then we could make the foriegners very angry or make our children become very violet and reckless because of the films on the shelves, and the people that come in to our country would never come back if they picked up the book that they might of thought that was int interesting but turns out to be very offensive in there opinion. Censorship is very imprtant in libraries and on the shelves.Five hundred guys have one thousand eyes for my baby   They stand around and stare, no matter where she goes   Five hundred men have one great big yen for my baby   They'd like to buy her things, like diamond rings and clothes   I really had to overcome a lot of competition   And I'm not telling how I reached my number one position   But four ninety nine are wasting their time with my baby   And here's the reason why they have my sympathy   'Cause, baby, she got eyes for me   Five hundred guys have one thousand eyes for my baby   They stand around and stare, no matter where she goes   Five hundred men have one great big yen for my baby   They'd like to buy her things, like diamond rings and clothes   I really had to overcome a gang of competition   And I'm not telling how I reached my number one position   But four ninety nine and they are wasting their time with my baby   And here's the reason why they have my sympathy   'Cause baby has two eyes, great big bright two eyes   Baby just has eyes for me, my baby just has eyes for me.Well, I went out with Jenny   Took out skinny Minnie   Long tall Sally   And short fat Fanny..I'd like to do a thing   That a new american anthem until we get another on together..Well I just wanna be a cosmic cowboy   Talkin' 'bout a supernatural country rockin' galoot.Why tu llegada rey me hico feliz   Why tu vida fue como un milagrito   Why tus ojitos azules me conquistaron   And you got your father's nose   Your father's nose   And you got your father's nose   Your father's nose   Ay guaguito de la irlanda eres bonito   Why to boquita ya dice mi nombrecito   Ay ay ay ay ay mama mia   Tengo mucha hambre dame   Mama mia dame la leche de tu pecho   And you got....And anything is possible when you're sowing the seeds of love..Then I'll float on down the river to the Cajun hideaway..And the storm is a-rolling   And the storm is a-rolling   All down on me..May I kill you please?.I'm tired of being grateful for a chance to take a dive   I'm sick of everything I do just to keep myself alive   When you cut away the skin that bears the brand   Standin' in the darkness, baby, there I am      Standin' in the darkness   Someone call my name out   Standin' in the darkness   Someone put the flame out   Standin' in the darkness   Baby, there I am   Where the world began      Saw the man in Jamaica, he had a shadow on his back   I recalled the ring of fire, and he wore his suit of black   When the legend and the ocean meet the sand   Standin' in the darkness, baby, there I am      Standin' in the darkness   Someone call my name out   Standin' in the darkness   Someone put the flame out   Standin' in the darkness   Baby, there I am   Where the world began      Everyone is so fabulous, hey, we all got our gun   Old Snakey's not a sinner, no, he just shows us how it's done   When you separate the wretched from the damned   Standin' in the darkness, baby, there I am      Standin' in the darkness   Someone call my name out   Standin' in the darkness   Someone put the flame out   Standin' in the darkness   Baby, there I am   Where the world began.Hope has found its home within me   Now that I've been found in You   Let all that I am be all You want me to be   'Cause all I want is more of You   Let Your presence fall upon us   I want to see You face to face   Let me live forever lost in Your love   'Cause all I want is more of You   All I want is more of You   I'm living for this cause   I lay down my life   Into Your hands   I'm living for the truth   The hope of the world   In You I'll stand   'Cause all I want is You   All I want is   All I want is You   Jesus.Etc!.Yes you who must leave everything that you cannot control..I don't need to be reminded that this is how it was..""I bring truth and understanding,   I bring wit and wisdom fair,   Precious gifts beyond compare..Forgot the trouble, that's the trouble..I know that I fuck like a sinner   I know that I'd fuck you 'til you're blue   I know that I'd fuck you 'til you're blue.And maybe you'll join me..If I'm not the one thing you can't stand to lose   If I'm not that arrow to the heart of you   Then I guess we're done let's not drag this on..Every thing's gonna be alright boys, help is on the way   Hold your head up high now, there's no need to cry now   We're not running anymore      Leave the politics behind boys, they're not working anymore   There's so much more at stake here, it's make or break here   Haven't we been here before -

"Does censorship solve any problems?  If one person wants to censor something in a library, there is bound to be another person on the other side of that arguement  trying to protect that work from be taken away.  As a free country, it is every individuals right to take in whatever form of literature or music that they find pleasing, and history has shown the world that censorship leads those in power down a dark road.  The shielding of offensive materials is only necessary and fair when the young, impressionable minds of the world's youth are at stake, but once a person is old enough to make informed decisions, it should be their perrogative to choose their own material.  Censorship is unacceptable on the grounds of personal rights and how it has affected history, but necessary when protecting the young.     It is a person's right to choose what kind of literature they would like to read.  If someone does not like a book and it becomes banned from a library, then everyone will want to have a book that they do not like banned.  For example take a hypothetical public library: a public library is an open, free place where men, women, and children of any background can come to learn and enjoy themselves with a good book, magazine, or music.  A great mental image of serenity and peace.  How does this picture appear to a bystander once books begin to disappear off of the shelves?  Suddenly right and left, books are disappearing as if by magic: a ceratin book is disapproved of by mothers, a religious group does not like the message this book sends, and this book makes people sad.  Before long, there are not very many books left in this hypothetical library other than books for toddlers.  With this system, everyone suffers.  Everyone should retain their right to read what they would like to.  It would all just be simpler if book were just not banned from libraries.     History has given the world many a cruel dictator.  Oftentimes, once he comes to power, he is not the most popular of governmental forms.  To keep his subjects underneath his rule, often he has to resort to taking away civil rights.  This could be a curfew, fake elections, or censorship.  If the ruler has the power of censorship, he or she can control what the public thinks, feels, and believes.  With this power over them, the people are weakened and often abused.  Now imagine that censorship occuring in a country that has civil rights.  People would not stand for it.  So why begin censorship in an area that promotes freedom?  There is absolutely no need for censorship to occur, and as history has shown, it certainly is not a good thing.     Censorship is unacceptable in all forms in a free country that promotes civil rights.  There is, however, one other element at play here: protection of youth and innocence.  Almost everyone can remember a time a child when they were young and innocent, free of worry and trouble.  That can disappear in a instant.  Children should not be exposed to things that are innappropriate for their age.  Nearly every movie nowadays has violent and risque, if not full-blown-adult, materials present in it.  The age of innocence is getting younger every generation, and children are becoming conditioned to this material to an extreme point.  A claim like this @MONTH1 sound hypotcritical coming from the mouth of one against censorship, but it is not 'censorship' when one is protecting the young.      Due to personal rights and what history has shown the world, censorship should never be tolerated unless on the grounds of protecting children.  It is each person's choice of what they would like to read and absorb, so their choices should not be infringed upon.  The world has seen on several occasions what censorship can do to people.  Also, children should be protected, and that is not censorship.  Censorship solves no problems, but it makes everyone unhappy.  Therefore, why censor.Ah we're beautiful fellas!.""This ain't Rock'n'Roll,   This is Genocide."".I'm gonna think of a way to get through that ball..Witches gather at black masses   Bodies burning in red ashes   On the hill the church in ruin   Is the scene of evil doings   It's a place for all bad sinners   Watch them eating dead rats' innards   I guess it's the same whereever you may go   Oh Lord yeah      Carry banners which denounce the lord   See me rocking in my grave   See them anoint my head with dead rat's blood   See them stick the stake through me   Oh      Don't hold me back cause I've just gotta go   They've got a hold of my soul now   Lords got my brain instinct with blood obscene (not sure about this line)   Look in my eyes I'm there enough   Yeah      On the scene a priest appears   Sinners falling at his knees   Satan sends out funeral pyre   Casts the priest into the fire   It's the place for all bad sinners   Watch them eating dead rats' innards   I guess it's the same whereever you may go   Oh lord yeah.Well,   Don't you know I'm wondering   Little girl, I'm wondering   How can I make you love me   A little more than you loved him?.Who do you love?.You bet your life I'm jealous babe,   Yeah,      You've been seen wit him all over town, baby   Yes, I'm jealous, goddam' jealous      You've been to Angelo's for a quiet dinner for two,   Then to Shakey Jake's where you danced until two,   Then to his place where I know you spent the night,   Got my spies girl, and they're all   Jealous      Did he really blow your mind,   Did he alway treat you kind,   Does he kiss you like I do,   Did he crawl all over you,   Did he have you on the floor,   Were you screaming out for more,   Is he better than I am,   Are you seeing him again..(What's your name?).Yo turn nigga!.Sometimes hate is not enough   To turn this all to ashes..[Bridge:]   I can tell that you're tired of being lonely (yeah)   Take my hand don't let go, baby, hold me (yeah)   Talk to me an let me be your one and only (hold my hand)   Cause I can make it alright till the morning..If you want her, you can keep her   If you want her, you can keep her   'Cause I can only handle one at a time,   'Cause I can only handle one at a time,   You can take her..He beat on me He cheat on me   He's mean to me ooo but he could be so sweet to me   My friends say I should give him up   But ohhhh I need him I need him a lot   That's why I'm gonna take it (take it take it) take what he's got      He disowns me He's going to sleep   But when we're alone he tells me ""I'm his very own""   Yes, he's got what I need but ohh I need what he's got   That's why I'm gonna take it (take it take it) take what he's got      Ohhh my friends say he's no good   He's not worth the time of day   For he could be an ice man, trash man, a junk man any kind of man   But nothing can drive me away ohhhh      He cause me pain, you make me wait sometimes out in the rain   You can make me feel ashamed but I never dress the same   And I love him so much nothing can make me stop      That's why I'm gonna take it (take it take it) take what he's got x2      Oooohhhh give it up give it up right now I'm gonna take it baby   (Take it take it) Take what he's got.Lean up, lean back   Lean up, lean back   Push in, pull out   Now thrust, now twist!.Any day now I will hear you say, ?Goodbye, my love?.Take me with you I will give you anything a woman needs,   Take me with you I will give you anything a woman needs..No!.Get into the groove   Let me show you some moves   Let's just take it from me........

"Do you think that books, movies, music, etc., should be moved if they are found offensive? I can't choose @CAPS3 they are both understandable. Therefore, I well dicuss how i feel about it in this essay and what I have experience on this topic.     Well lets get started! I could go both ways with this. But first I well just discuss the way I disagree with removing offensive things. Material that is instersting to many people mght not be instersting to me. I mean everyone should be able to listen and read things that the loved and enjoy. And I could really careless what other people loved to read and listen to. Someday, we all might come to enjoy things that we wouldn't every think we would. It's just that simply. I mean I love romance and scary books, and someone else might dislike them both. Noone can tell anyone what they should like or dislike.          I agree in away too! When people make a big deal out of somethings it kind of gets on your nerves, like when your mom is telling you make sure room is clean all the time! I agree with this @CAPS3 something maybe to offensive to someone and doesn't want their children. One time I was in a library looking at this book that really seemed good to read. But then some lady told me that I shouldn't read it @CAPS3 it to much for me. But it was just right for me. @CAPS2 went up to the main desk and started complaining. I was like, 'Are you serious?' I didn't want to be rude so I told her calmly, '@CAPS1 are you so worried about what I am reading?' @CAPS2 replied, ' @CAPS3, the book is to reviling.' I showed her what the book was called, '@CAPS4 @CAPS5 @CAPS6'. We ended the agruement. I still checked out the book, @CAPS3 I knew I would love it, and I do! They should just put things aside, that they think well be offensive and let people ask for the things. So people won't make a big deal out of it. Just keep the peace and give everyone what they want.          Well I'm done now. Hope you understand both sides of the agruement. Just remember that if you agree or disagree.Or you like me, who can't choice or understands both sides. It's your decision and noone can make you change what you love and enjoy to read or listen to. But I can't pick aside @CAPS3 either way their both a understandable..Eternal life is now on my trail   Got my red glitter coffin, man, just need one last nail   While all these ugly gentlemen play

"Offensive much? Thats what multiple people feel towards curtain books. For instence if @CAPS5 was the bible and you were an athiest, or a person who doesn't believe in god, then the bible @MONTH1 be offensive and hurtfull to you. I feel as a student that there are so many people in the world that by the time everyone inserts their own feelings by taking away books then we would have nothing left to read. You see, everyone is different in their own way, so books, magazines and music wouldn't be around because everyone feels differently about different subjects. I feel that they are a resourse that is very helpfull, and multiple times knowledgeable on many grasping subjects.      First, besides books, we have magazines. If we would get rid of all of the magazines in the world then there would be a cut down on all those horrible advertisements that men long for. Second there would be less gossip. Most magazines are about @PERCENT1 gossip about the recent break-ups, and make-ups, of todays modern celebritys. I feel that the magazines are a waste of time because they hurt peoples feelings, also its offensive the way that some famous people act. I strongly believe we should take magazines off the shelves.     Lastly there is music. Some of the greatest inspiration comes from music. Don't you remember the song, 'We @CAPS1't @CAPS2 the @CAPS3?' @CAPS4 if you don't then i'll tell you a little about @CAPS5. @CAPS5's about america, things that have happened in the past and were a big deal. In the chorus @CAPS5 says, '-we @CAPS1't @CAPS2 the @CAPS3,- but we tried to fight @CAPS5. @CAPS5's always been burning since the worlds been turning.' @CAPS5's a song that is about americans saying that they @CAPS1't cause panic and such things, but that since the begining of time @CAPS5 already was. The song inspired many of the famous singers you @CAPS4 know. Elvis @CAPS6 is one of the many that you should know. We should keep music out so people, like me, who have been inspired, can inspire others. Music helps the blind, heals those who are sick, and give hope to americans. Without mucis there would be chaos.     Last and furthermore is movies, where would we be without movies? We need movies, not just for our intertainment, but some of the best movies are historical events. Events that help us get a better grasp and keen look at what has happened in the past. For instince the movie @CAPS7, and @LOCATION1, even the movie The @CAPS8 @CAPS9, they all help us picture events that have happened and are very enjoyable but also very educational. We should keep movies, there is no doubt in my mind.     In conclusion I hope I have created a clear message that you will take into consideration highly. We need books and music to inspire and electrify the world, and magazines we need not. We all need a little inspiration in our down spiraling lives, and we need education. Not the kind that we wish to see but the kind we need to see. I hope I have made a positive inpact on your thoughts, and feelings..In the beginning there was order and destiny   but now that path has reached the border,   and on our knees   is no way to face the future, whatever it be..[During the Could be famous...]A Star.....So get by the green way, yes!.Cry like a child, though these years make me older,   With children my time is so wastefully spent,   A burden to keep, though their inner communion,   Accept like a curse an unlucky deal..Hang on   It's no fun..

"There are too many people in the world to just have one opinion about one topic and nothing else. If a person knows something is unjust, they obviously have to tell the world about it, or they feel like their opinion does not matter. Take, for example, women's clothing. If you show a man a piece of women's clothing on a computer screen, he will probably only have one or two opinions about that piece of clothing. If you show a woman that same piece of clothing, she will have more than two opinions about the piece of clothing. This is how society works today and it is not just because we were brought up that way; this is how we think and how we act.     @ORGANIZATION1 depicts beautiful as half dressed and makup put on like plaster. Many magazines and books, such as @CAPS1 and books about modeling, portray beautiful as stick thin and your clothes almost falling off your body. Many songs and movies tell you that being beautiful is on the outside. If you can find these magazines, books, and movies at your local bookstore, don't you think that they could possibly be two miles down the road at your local @CAPS2 library?      Libraries aren't just for adults and teenagers. They are intended for people of all ages. Many people do not realize this, but at many libraries, there are sections specified for teenagers. Young adult books and magazines should not even be put in the teenager section, only for the reason that there are subjects in many of the young adult books that a lot of teenagers have not even begun to dicuss yet. If these books and magazines are put in here for teenagers, do you not think a five year old child could wander up to the section, take out a magazine and wonder how the women in the advertisements grew up to be so beautiful? Like I said before, @ORGANIZATION1 depicts people to look beautiful, when it's all photo-shopped.      If a five year old child can get their hands on books and magazines that they shouldn't even know about, @CAPS3 would a library keep them on their shelves. The thoughts that the five year old child has now is '@CAPS3 am I not that beautiful?' @CAPS4 image is the key to how people view society today. Modeling agencies, photographers, and even cheerleading coaches make girls feel like they are worthless because they are 'too fat', 'too ugly', or 'too short' to be part of what they have wanted to be in their entire lives. Many women that @CAPS8 starve themselves every day just to maintain the 'healthy weight' which is @NUM1 pounds and you can see every rib in her body.      Many books, magazines, and television shows portray this as well. You can find them in libraries nation-wide. The magazine, @CAPS1, has articles about how to become skinny. The television show, @LOCATION1's @CAPS6 @CAPS7 @CAPS8, shows people that being tall and as skinny as a stick is the way to go. Many workout books tell you that being like @PERSON1 is the 'best for your bod' way to be. You cannot tell a girl that she needs to be a specific height and a specific weight by a specific time. Woman don't work that way. No one does.      Many magazines, books, movies, and music tell you this, and it is not true. I believe that if libraries took these types of materials out of their facilities, then if would drop the rate of society's '@CAPS4 image' rapidly. Many woman and girls wouldn't feel like they are ugly or fat. They would love who they were and they would not believe what another person says about them or what they look like. Being beautiful is not just on the outside. Anyone can have a beautiful heart and that will shine through more than anything else..And I curse the sun for risin'   For the worse Lord, is yet to come   Cause this mornin' she's just leavin'   But

"The topic of library censoring has been increasing over the past few years. It has been discussed by many people, but a decision has never been reached. I say that there should be no library censoring. I would not have found my love for reading if libraries were censored like they are.     I think that there should be no censoring of libraries. It would impair our basic rights. Such as our right to freedom of expression. And our right freedom to the press.We would no longer live in a free country but a totalterrian state.     Though if they would put an age restriction on certian things that @MONTH1 please the debators. I think that many would agree to this if it was proposed . Thus, if we did this children would only be able to read or listen to materials apporiate for their age.     Though it is the parents who should censor what the children read and listen to not the libraries. It's the parents who introducee the children to music, magazines, and books. If the parents started to censor these materials early on this debate would not be going on as it is.     The topic of library censoring has been discussed and debated at increasing rates over that past years. Some want to censor our libraries though that is not the best choice. @PERSON1 said 'that if we have the right to censor libraries then thier will be no more books for any of us..Please stop saying there ain't nothing wrong..My mind plays tricks on me,   It's unbelievable you see,   I'm always testing the shit around me..(Yuh!.Sometimes this old world gets to me   And I sure can be a jerk   But

"Libraries.     What things are found in libraries? Well libraries contain more then just books. They can have music, movies, magazines, books, and much more. All of the things are not for just one particular age. Libraries have things for people of all ages, even though some do not like many of the materials found in them.      The library in my town has certin place for chilrden, teens, adults, and for @CAPS1-rated thing. Not all people agree with what should be aloud in a public area. Libraries try to make everyone that comes find something that might be intersting to them. Even though some of the things they chose might be different then what the public expects.     When I go to the library I think I would mind is i saw some @CAPS1-rated thing. Even though I think everyone should have the freedom to read, watch, listen, and hear about what they want. I think making areas where children can't go is a good way of letting people get what they want to get and not exposing it to younger people. Haveing these areas would help parents and childern feel alot better about what they would hear or see at a library.     What can be done about this problem? Even though it @MONTH1 cost more or be to dificult for an ower of a library to do, I think that building rooms for different age groups would be an good thing to do. If smaller children see thing such as violace, durgs, and sex, they @MONTH1 think that it is ok to do. Most parents try and keep there kids away for those parts of library but don't always sucide. So there for I think that building rooms for these area is the right thing to do.     Even though we all think different things should or shoulden't be seen in public, we can't stop them from being there. We could try to contain them to where only people that would like to see them do. It would just cost a little more money then some are willing to spend, but if you think of when you were a child would you of liked to see some of those things? If u ever have kids whould you like for them to see it? I would hope not. So try and make the better choic when u find unupropret things for unger viewers..P.S..I've seen your face before   Show me some way to help you   How have you come to grief   In a place such as

I got down on the floor with my head pressed between my knees   Under the bed with my teeth sunk into my own flesh   I said ""baby, oh sweetheart""      Lust turns to anger, a kiss to a slug   Something was sticky on your shag rug, look at the tile   I remember the way he groaned and moved with an animal skill   I rubbed my face in the sweat that ran down his chest   It was all very run of the mill   But I noticed his scent started to change somehow   His face went berserk and the veins bulged on his brow   I said ""baby, oh sweetheart""      Bondage to lust, abuse of facility   Blackmailed emotions confuse the demon and devotee   I was sure his intentions were sweet   And that mine was as well   But a wish is a shot in the dark   When your coin's down the well      I got out in the hall with my teeth in my head   Up to my neck and I said, said, said dead   I said ""baby, oh sweetheart"".There's a shadow just behind me,   Shrouding every step I take,   Making every promise empty,   Pointing every finger at me..Oh oh oh shalala lala, shalala in the sunshine..repeat   repeat.Lo from the-the the block   Ey, I love you, mami, I love you, mami   Baby, you the shit, I-I love you, mami      I think I love just who you are   We haven't grown apart   This is just the start..last week and scrubbed like ?.Let me tell you 'bout a girl I know,   I love her, I love her..No fun in the new world   I'm glad we've arrived here   But will we survive here   Yeah, in the new world..Got a few good tales to unwind   Turn around, don't look down   There's a man behind you with a gun..There's no earthly way of knowing,   What's in your heart when its' stopped going..Don't do nothing   drastic you spastic, cause I bomb the mic like a fascist..This song appears on three albums,

"As Katherine Paterson said, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf.'  I think we all can agree with @CAPS2. We have all read something that we did not necessarily want to finish or that we wish we had not read.  I, however, believe that these materials should not be taken off of the shelves and be put out of reach of our youth, or adults.  When you take away materials that some people use to learn, you take away their ability to learn.  Yes, they @MONTH1 choose another book and learn from it too but it should not be our choice to dictate what they can and can not read.Take for example the popular internet video clip, '@CAPS1 guys one hammer.'  @CAPS2 is a video of two guys beating a homeless man to death with a hammer and screwdriver.  I have never seen @CAPS2 movie and listening to my friends talk about it, I do not want to.  @CAPS2 seems like a gruesome and horrific video clip that would scar me for life, but it is a perfect example for @CAPS2 because what some do not want to learn from, others can.  I would never watch @CAPS2 or anything like @CAPS2 but my friends who have watched @CAPS2 have learned something. That is that you should be successful in life because if you are homeless then you could be beaten to death by some teenagers who are looking to have some 'fun.'  I kid you not, after hearing about @CAPS2 sad video it has inspired me to be a successful person and not become homeless. @CAPS2 brings us back to the main point - had someone said, 'No, @CAPS2 video can not be on the internet.' none of my friends would have seen @CAPS2 or told me about it.  Therefore I would not be driven to be a good student and a good person.  Then, when I was older I would have become homeless and would have had the chance to be the star in one of these videos. You can be sure that that is not something that I would want to be.In conclusion, I believe we should not interfere with some people's right to learn.  We should not take away materials that can be used to learn no matter how bad we think they are, because you never know, one man's pain is another man's learning tool. If we all took away the materials that we felt were innappropriate or needed censorship then we would have very few learning materials left.

"To who it @MONTH1 concern:     @CAPS1 you take away books because someone might find them offensive? Do you believe racism is a part of liturature? Libraries are considering removing books, music, movies, magazines, etc. from their inventory for censorship. They believe individuals might take offense to certain types of beliefs from the different variety of entertainment that they have in their library. These types of entertainment should not be aloud to be removed from public or private libraries.     In many libraries, their inventory is being stripped for censorship. This means that books, magazines, movies and music is being removed because some individuals might find it offensive. Individuals might disagree with certain beliefs concerning their lifestyle and what they believe.      Liturature can be described as art that an individual portrays it as in his/her own way. It has been in the world since man first learned to write to present day. This means it has been there wars, politics, art and slavery. All of these are a part of liturature, so liturature is history in it's own way.     Some say offensive material should be taken out of libraries. they might think that it should be removed from everywhere. It should not. It is a part of history. @CAPS1 you take away an era of history just because you find it offensive? I know I wouldn't. It tells us what was happening at that certain time. It tells us what was happening in that part of the world. It tells us what the opinions were of people at that time. Many people believe racism is wrong, but we shouldn't believe that no one thought it was right. Many people thought is was right. They might believe white skin is superior over dark skin, but we should respect their beliefs in return that they respect our's.     Liturature is important to society and how it works. Without it, we wouldnt be where we were today. Liturature should stay in the shelves of libraries where they belong. Personal opinions are a part of books, and we should respect that. @CAPS1 you want to be know for destroying an important part of history.Goin' down to see some girl   Goin' to have some fun..I am human and I need to be loved   Just like everybody else does.I can find a lover..Fuck it, get Dr. Dre on it   You got a budget?.I won't be denied,   I'm never going to leave your side,   I will always be   On the river of endless love      In the silence just before the dawn   The shadows lose their form..[Usher]   What's so complicated   Everythings so simple when you say it   No one said the shit was easy   No one said I'd take you out in the city   Forgive me forgive   But fuck with me fuck with fuck with me, now      I'mma be real with you now, I don't know why I called her   When you called me I was wrong, so thats why I bought ya   Couple things for your wrist, thats shining in the dark   Hope you'd forgive me thats why I bought it Yeah   Fuck with me fuck with fuck with me   Can't you see that I'm trying   Fuck with me fuck with fuck with me      Baby I can change can you stick around yeah   Fuck with me fuck with fuck with me   It's easy when I'm up can you hold me down      Tell me what nigga is perfect   Tell me what nigga is right   Tell me what nigga has been with the same bitch   And she holding it down for life   Tell me who get it right on the first try   I know I did wrong but what nigga is trying harder   Than the one in this song   Can you stay down   Fuck with me fuck with fuck with me   Boo don't give up on me now   Fuck with me fuck with fuck with me   Fuck with me fuck with fuck with me      Baby I can change can you stick around yeah   Fuck with me fuck with fuck with me   It's easy when I'm up can you hold me down   Fuck with me fuck with fuck with me   Baby I can change can you stick around yeah   Fuck with me fuck with fuck with me   It's easy when I'm up can you hold me down   Fuck with me fuck with fuck with me      I ain't perfect, but smile ?.Just confused   Jeff don't wear regular shoes   Jeff don't wear regular shoes.Tender like a night in June,   Sweeter than a honeymoon,   Brighter than a silver spoon,   Just as crazy as a loon..I try to sing this song   I...I try to stand up   But I can't find my feet   I try, I try to speak up   But only in you I'm complete      Gloria...in te domine   Gloria...exultate   Gloria...Gloria   Oh Lord, loosen my lips      I try to sing this song   I...I try to get in   But I can't find the door   The door is open   You're standing there   You let me in      Gloria...in te domine   Gloria...exultate   Oh Lord, if I had anything   Anything at all   I'd give it to you   I'd give it to you      Gloria...Gloria....And you've got a gift for anyone   Who will give you his applause..I'm wet and I'm cold   But thank God I ain't old   Why didn't I ever say what I mean?.My   Dirty desire?.Tel Aviv and Agadir,   Taroudant or Olomouc   Before I learned to see   The vanishing point appear      I looked for you and everywhere..Yeah, I'ma lean low nigga, to the flo' nigga   Can you pay what you weight gimme mo'?.Should I give up,   Or should I just keep chasing pavements?.we comin,   First go about money   [Chorus x2]   [Verse 3 - Young Buck]   Its all bout thuggin,   Gettin paid and shit,   You either slang the dope or hit major licks,   That's why all my niggas be sevin bricks,   Y'all gunna see what we workin with,   Not me baby doll,   I ain't hurtin for shit,   G.S..I want us to be like peter pan   But dreams it seems are weightless as sand,   And mans supposedly is made of sand   It seems that man cannot survive at all      Lets disappear love, lets fly away   Into the demi-monde, into the twilight zone   The times inside I spent screaming at you   Release me please from this mortal jail   One shrug or smile can determine my fate,   I'm lost for days and have myself to blame      Something I'm giving, is yours for the taking,   Something like sunlight, love is a spotlight   Love is all sorrow, still Ill meet you tomorrow   And look forward to see you, now I can't live without you.Love me tender, love me long, take me to your heart..Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose,   And nothin' ain't worth nothin' but it's free,   Feelin' good was easy, Lord, when Bobby sang the blues,   And buddy, that was good enough for me,   Good enough for me and my Bobby Mcgee..They're like children...

"Should someones work catagorized as 'inappropiate' or 'offensive' be taken off of a shelf and not able to be sold or seen in stores? If you believe so, then do you think it is okay for the campaigners that run for @CAPS1 be able to express their thoughts and opinions on different topics? This is exactly what is being done when someone writes an article or a book that they have published to be distributed into stores or libraries.     When someone writes a book on something, they usually have a lot of interest in whatever topic they are discussing. Just as when @CAPS2 campaigners present themselves to the public and announce what party they will be running for and what their beliefs and disbeliefs are. If it is okay for someone to take a book off of a shelf, or even a magazine because people think the book is 'inappropiate' then maybe we should reconsider what the campaigners say on live @CAPS3.      Even if you were to walk into a store and there be nude magazines on the shelf, or cd's with lyrics that contain cuss words do you feel those should be taken off of shelves as well? There is a time and a place for where things like this should not be displayed. For example, when you go to a little kids store and things like this are being sat out for the kids to see, they will not forget what they saw or heard if referring to music. Kids have a great memory on things that should not be remembered. Like when they read a story and it includes someone robbing a bank, or a song that refers to drinking or doing some form of drug. When kids see or even hear things like this, they are more likely to try things that we would hope little kids would not try.     When someone spends months or even years on writing a story, they hope that they can get it published and be rewarded for their long, hard work. By doing this they try and get it to be published, and put in stores so people can buy it. Whether or not if your talking about music, movies, or books, its all the same. Things should be put out on display and people should be able to see all the different types of music and stories that are available.      If things were going to be taken off of shelves or not put out onto display, people will stop recording music, acting out movies, or even writing ad's and books. When and if this were to happen, people will not become educated with new available data. If there is nobody to write science books, or biography's then nobody will learn about new things. Same with music and movies, if people spend a few months or even a year writing a new album, or coming up with an idea for a movie and they work hard to get it done, they expect to get it out to the public. If its finally out and people have the chance to buy it, they hope it will stay available. If it doesn't and people think the movie is 'inappropiate' then the song writers and actors will more then likely not have the urge to do it all over again.     In conclusion, I think that if someone writes something or records something that has taken them a good amount of work and time that they should be rewarded and allowed to have their item sold. If someone belives that an item is 'inappropiate' then they should keep their comments to themselves, and not have the item taken off display. There are some people out there that enjoy things that are not 'appropiate' and they think its funny. Surely if the write or producer got a book or movie produced they thought it was good, and they believe that people will buy their product. So, if the writer thinks this, surely there is someone out there that feels the same. How are we to know if there is someone out there that agrees, and enjoys the book or movie if it has been taken off of the shelf because someone thought the material was 'inappropiate.'.What makes you

"What if someone told you that you couldn't wear a yellow shirt because it was offensive? What if they said you couldn't look a certain way because you might offend somebody? Not just one person or group of people have the right to decide what is suitable and what is not. There are so many different religions and traditions throughout the @LOCATION2 it would be completely rediculous to set one standard for all people. If @CAPS1 aren't restricted when it comes to apperal, groceries, or automobiles, why should there be limits in the libraries? Libraries should not be censored because not only would censorship limit the resoursfulness of the libraries and smother the knowledge intake across the @LOCATION2, but it would also pose a threat to our future.      When one takes a trip to the library, one would expect to find a book, magazine, and/or movie on just about anything. It would be extremely frustrating to find that a library, which is supposed to contain content on nearly every subject, does not have what your looking for. Say a book on the asassination of @PERSON1 is what you fancy, so you ask the librarian where you could find it. You would be dissapointed if she says they don't carry assassination books because they are too vulgar for young children. This could become very troubling and would limit the library's resources.           Not only would censorship in libraries limit the content but it would also limit learning in the @LOCATION2 @CAPS2 are people supposed to stay informed if they are being sheilded from knowledge? Many people that do not have computers depend on the library. If they cannot get what they need at the library where would they go? The libraries would lose business and funding if they did not supply library-goers with the content which they desire. People would take their business elsewhere. Protests @MONTH1 break out and rebelious citizens @MONTH1 protest the censorship, causing an uproar in society.           The people would not be the only thing out of hand. The censorship would surely get out of hand, aswell. @CAPS1 are already being censored through news stations, radio, and tv shows. Libraries are a place where infinant knowledge is realistic and that is comforting for many @CAPS1. In libraries people choose what they learn: they aren't forced teachers or parents. The censorship @MONTH1 start out as a small intervention, but it could turn our nation upside down. Next thing we know, our desisions could be influenced by the books that only 'they' decide are suitable. What kind of society would we have then? Individuality would be lost and opinions would be forgotten.      Clearly, censorship in libraries is dangerous and unpredictable. If libraries were cencored, not only would  knowledge in the @LOCATION2 desinegrate, but libraries would lose their respect and threaten the future of @LOCATION1. No one tells me what to wear or say, so why should anyone tell me what to read? We are all entitled to our own opinions and beliefs. Our @CAPS4 @CAPS5 earned us our freedoms, we can not let censorship take them away.Armageddon, it's gotten   No savior jailer can take it from me   World ending, it's just beginning   And rock and

"Freedom of speech is a keen aspect in @LOCATION1 and thats what made our country flourish through many years. In the constitution it states that there is freedom of the press, which means that if something is written that might affend some people, then they have to deal with it. Some might say that some material is offensive, which sometimes it is. However I do not think that the books, magazines, etc. should be taken off the shelfs due to the feelings of another persons thoughts.     In @LOCATION1 over the years things have become more exceptable in media and books.  The rights have always been there but not fully practised. There have been book burnings, banned books, and even people being killed for there writings. For many years it went on until @LOCATION1 changed its way of thinking to a broader more open perepective. Though it still goes on I think that it is very closed minded. In some cases people blamed books that had nothing to do with killing someone, for the reason why they commited a murder.I do think there is a limit to how you distibute certain books and magazines. They shouldnt sell a book about death,poverty,or sex at a public school.      We all have diffrent things we like to read and write about. So why shoud we be taken away from because somone thinks its to offensive. I think not, if you dont like it then put it down and let someone pick it up who will read it. With my own experience i have seen bad people do what is expected of them , bad things. And they try to blame it on a book, story, or @CAPS1 show they had seen. Thats just a easy way out of a situation. I have read and saw very intense things in my life but does that make me want to do  bad things, no!      I know i cant speak for everyone when I say that books, magazines etc. or not harmful. But think about it like this wouldn't sometimes the person reading the stories figure they could learn and embrace from it rather then go out and do what the character did in the story? Reading opens up new things and is scientificly proven to make you smarter in the long run. The more you read the more awareness and knowledge you gain ,and just becuase you read a book about something doesn't mean you support it. It could maybe mean that you want to learn about it so you can understand it more..Tenderness really moves me   Tenderness try to show me   Tenderness come on show me   Tenderness feelings grow and

regrets from me      Maybe I'll be back some other day   To live again just who can say   In what shape or form that I might be   Just another chance for me      A hurried time no disgrace   Instead of racing to conclusion   And wishing all my life away   No-one can stop me now      Time is up it couldn't last   But there's more things I'd like to do   I'm coming back to try again   Someday maybe I'll wait till then      No more lies      They're all sitting at my table   Talking tall and drinking wine   Their time is up just like me   But they just don't know it yet      So just a word of warning   When you're in your deepest dreams   There's nothing you can hide from   I've got my eye on you      The clock is fast, the hour is near   Eventful past is ever clear   My life is set, the

I believed I'd taken a bride called Mary Stanford   And I flew into a frenzy searching high and low   Because in my dream the girl was very young      I said, ""Hey little girl, where do you hide?.I'm yours until the day I die..Know no fear I'll still be here tomorrow   Bend my ear I'm not gonna go away   You are love so why do you shed a tear   Know no fear you will see heaven from here      I'll

love in your eyes   And it fills me up when you start to cry      I just wanna hold you near   We will see heaven from here      Well it all seems out of reach   I will take the blame if it keeps the peace   My shelf life's short   Wish they'd make it more easy to follow   And I've been caught with nothing but   Love on my mind   We are love don't let it fall on deaf ears   Now it's clear we have seen heaven from here.Too many puppies..Crab man   Devil crab!.Uhhh!"
"Many books, movies, and magazines are made for the different age groups of adults and children.  I do agree that certain books are not approperiate for some children.  Is it right for some parents to ban books from schools and libraries?  Authors create books and stories because they like the idea, and students can wright what we want on paper because it's what we want it's called freedom.  Schools can try to be creative and have a way to only allow books to the approperate age groups.     Books are a great part of a students learning.  Parents need to learn, and understand no matter how much they don'@CAPS1 like it that they can'@CAPS1 protect their children from the world some day they will be moved out of the house supporting themselves.  How would childern and teens even know how to live or what and how to react to hearing a bad word or watching sexual on @CAPS1.V.  If students never know how will they live.       Books can be learning in many ways.  Some things a teenager might be experiencing a parent might not want to talk about with their child.  Maybe the family can'@CAPS1 afford to buy a pass to the public library. So the only other option is the school library books.  If students can'@CAPS1 have access to then whats the option for them?  Everyone knows how today's society is changing, if a student wants to learn about sex or @ORGANIZATION1's they should be able to if the age is approprite.     All libraries check out books so the book is under a name.  I know at our school students just come in and take the books instead of checking them out, but some students do still use the card and check the book out.  If schools had books that our for only a certain age group a soultion to getting the older students to check them out and only the right age could be the books are in a case that is locked up.  So for the student to have the book unlocked and checked they have an electronic key to unlock books for the age group they are in. When the student unlocks the book and goes to check it out the computer knows what books that specific student can get.  Books are very important to learning and all books need to stay and not get blocked by  parents..Ohh!.Hang on in there, baby..Well, I got no job to go to..Standing..Some day when your boat is here   And you're way out there,   You may remember the summer clouds   And that I tried to reach you..I can't relive my life   I can't retrace my tracks   I can't undo what's done   There is no going back   I chased a selfish dream   Did not survey the cost   Illusions disappeared   I've found my innocence lost   Some say it's lessons learned   Some say it's a living life   I say it's choices made   Knowing wrong from right   One night I fought to sleep   In my slumber I turned and tossed   I woke to a cloudy day   And found my innocence lost   Innocent child is a beautiful thing   Secure in her father's arms   Sleeps while a mother sings   There's no way to know   All the harm this world can bring   I miss my innocence   Oh, to be innocent   My heavenly Father   The way of eternal love   That overflows with grace   I can completely trust   My broken heart repaired   And all my sin forgot   I can be pure again   In spite of my innocence lost   In his eyes I'm a newborn child   'cause I accept his love   I have a newfound hope   Though I've found my innocence lost   I can be pure again   I've found my innocence lost.I need a pocket fisherman!.Say goodbye, say good bye, say goodbye ..Pretty woman, won't you look my way..Tonight, cause I want to get laid..I don't want no other love,   Baby it's just you I'm thinking of..Thank ya Jesus!.Not afraid to go there, why don't u open up   After 9 to 5, you deserve some 12   Making future plans, to be where I dwell      [Chorus: x2]      From my toes up (From my toes up)   To my knee cap (to my knee caps, to waistline)   And slowly (and slowly, lady)   Can we go half on my baby [Repeat: x2]      [Chorus].See it all makes sense, doesn't it?.I've been out walking   I don't do too much talking these days   These days   These days I seem to think a lot   About the things that I forgot to do   And all the times I had the chance to      I stopped my ramblin'   I don't do too much gamblin' these days   These days   These days I seem to think about   How all the changes came about my way   And I wonder if I'll see another highway      And I had a lover   I don't think I'll risk another these days   These days   And if I seem to be afraid   To live the life that I have made in song   Well it's just 'cause I've been losing so long      Well I'll stop my dreamin'   I don't do too much schemin' these days   These days   These days I'll sit on cornerstones   And count the time in quartertones to ten   Please don't confront me with my failures   I had not forgotten them.When he's out drinkin' he's a Dickhead in the bar..If the start of the day is the end of the night   The end of the night is the start of the day   And once it has gone it will never come back again      Well, we know where we are   And we know that we've come so far   And we'll never come back again      Now I know that its true 'cause everybody knew   Before me, so where can I go now?.Now Rocky Raccoon he fell back in his room   Only to find Gideon's bible   Gideon checked out and he left it no doubt   To help with good Rocky's revival..Bob White!.There was a time   When I was so brokenhearted   Love wasn't much of a friend of mine   The tables have turned -

"Censorship in libraries? In my opinion I don't really care if books, movies, or magazines are censored. I'm not a person that does much reading but I do know of some books, magazines, and movies that are filled with perfanity. In my opinion that is just the authors way of how he or she wanted to do it.      I believe that libraries should keep these type of materials on the shelves but have them in sections maybe. Taking them off the shelves would be disrespectful to the authors/producers. That is their work and they took the time to do it for our entertainment! Maybe you really dislike all the cursing in books and magazines and want them gone...Well listen, there are heeps and heeps of books out there you can find that are not bad!      If you are more of the movie type of person but also do not like the cursing or nudity, there are plenty of movies out there that are very innocent! I hate when I sit down to watch a movie with the family and then all of sudden the actors start throwing around the @CAPS1 word and half naked women appear. But if we would simply read about the movie on the back of the case or ask about it then we would know to choose a different movie. One that is more family oriented and safe for children eyes.     So just because there are some materials that are out there with all sorts of fowl language and indecent human behaviors doesn't mean you should ban them from the libraries. If some people want to fill their mind with filth, let them. But for you who do not, get other stuff. Simply try telling other people about better books they can read and nicer movies to watch. Be a role modle and teach them about healthier viewings.Don't help me, (help me)   I can do it and you know it..Saw my lawyer, Mr. Good News   He got me joint custody and legal separation..I know the

Take away my heartache, in the night like a thief      [Chorus]      Yes I need her in the daytime   Yes I need her in the night   Yes I want to throw my arms around her   Kiss her hug her kiss her hug her tight      And when I'm returning from so far away   She gives me some sweet lovin' brighten up my day   Yes it makes me righteous, yes it makes me feel whole   Yes it makes me mellow down in

"I do not believe that censorship in libraries is a good thing. For many reasons but to save sometime here are just a few of the reasons why I believe this, there would be no books left for anyone to read, if certain books where taken off the shelf we would not have the knowledge from them, and our kids would not know what other people can think of. At the end of this essay one might understand the advandages and disadvantages to censorship in libraries. @CAPS6 many books would be gone?     If we all took off one book that we found offensive then our children and other children would not be able to read. Taking off one offensive book per person leaves no books left in a library. What one person @MONTH1 find offensive another person could find rather enjoyable. Some of my friends think that '@CAPS1' is an offensive novel but I found the book to be rather enjoyable. On the other hand we also have to understand that there are somethings that just shouldn't be put out in public. @CAPS6 would we get as much knowledge as we have?     Without all the books that are in our libraries @CAPS6 would people get the knowledge to make great discoveries in science, history, and electronics? People would be lost if we didn't have our books. The books give people great knowledge and a great place to learn @CAPS6 to do things. I myself have learned @CAPS6 to become a successful @CAPS2 novel @CAPS3 from the @CAPS4 I took out of 'A @CAPS2 @CAPS3's @CAPS4 for @CAPS5.' @CAPS6 would the ideas of other people be heard around the world without books in our libraries?     Those books that are offensive can also be of great use when doing a research paper or just trying to find something to talk about with friends at school or work. Without the books that we have in the library people would not be able to understand what other people thought about certain ideas on politics and other issues in daily life. The books help people come up with ideas to create things and be createative in everything they do. The ideas that one person expresses in their writing is a great place to find a spark of imagination when a person needs something to keep their mind off of personal issues. Life without books?     Censorship is a good and bad thing in libraries, I myself on one hand do not find it appropraite but on the other hand it can be taken to a whole different perspective. People who want to use it don't understand that other people could take the books off the shelf that they, themselves like to read in their spare time, nor do they understand all the knowledge that we gain from books even if they are fiction, and lastly without the books that we have no one would know what someone in a different park of the world was thinking. Foremost people who want cenorship in libraries don't understand what would happen if we had the power to all take one book off the shelf. One could understand both sides of the coin here but we need to step back and think about what life would be like without our books..She had to heave me right across her shoulder, Cause I just can't seem to drink you off my mind..Every picture tells a story don't it?.No, no..It's something else to see the way you're growing   From a sweet little baby to a grown up girl   And I pray though darlin' I've no way to knowing   That you'll discover a beautiful world   As you skip down the street and hold your books so tightly   Tell me what are you learning in your ABC   Are you dreaming off all the many things you might be   You know that we're just waiting to see   Schoolgirl, you're such an inspiration   Schoolgirl and you're as fresh as the breeze   You've got the whole world just waiting for you   You're really something, something to see   It's easy to worry in a world of trouble   When there's nothing but bad news trying to bring you down   But life doesn't have to be an uphill struggle   There's still some wonderful things to be found   Schoolgirl, you're such an inspiration   Schoolgirl and you're as fresh as the breeze   You've got the whole world just waiting for you   You're really something, something to see   There is sadness and confusion in our hearts   And the world prepares to fight   As it tears itself apart, it isn't fair   Schoolgirl, you're such an inspiration   Schoolgirl and you're as fresh as the breeze   You've got the whole world waiting for you   Girl, you're really something, something to see   You're little schoolgirl   You're as fresh as the breeze   You've got the whole world waiting for you   You're really something, something to see   Little schoolgirl, you're such an inspiration   Schoolgirl and you're as fresh as the breeze   You've got the whole world waiting for you   Girl, you're really something, something to see.J: (???).Eponine   Well I told you I'd do it, told you I'd do it...

"Libraries have always been an outstanding source for information. Among the myriad of resourceful materials provided by libraries are book, movies, and magazines. Recently, the debate over whether libraries should censor offensive materials has caused quite a stir. Many parents argue that they don't want their children to be exposed to explicit materials, especially books, exhibited in public libraries. Others have retorted to this statement by saying that if every book that is viewed as offensive is taken off the shelves, the shelves would be nearly empty. Author Katherine Paterson stated,      ' All of us can think of  book that we hope none of our children have taken off the shelf-that work i abhor-then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us' (Katherine Paterson). Books that are offensive should not be removed from libraries for the simple reason that they are still one of the most reliable sources for information and historical events, and, without books, society would suffer.     The most important reason as to why people shouldn't be allowed to remove offensive books from shelves is that if every person was allowed to remove a book that he/she found offensive, there wouldn't be many books remaining on the libraries' shelves. There are many historical works that contain offensive images and content, but people have to overlook this because these books are accounts of our history. Without them, society would forget about the past events that shaped and molded our world into the world it is today.      Another  important reason why library censhorship is wrong is that material that one person @MONTH1 find to be offensive @MONTH1 not be ofensive to another. Every person has his/her own view on certain matters and events. For this reason, the censorship of a certain book shouldn't come down to the opinion of one individual. Rather, the decision to take a certain book off of library shelves should come from the opinions of a large group of individuals. By doing so, a fair representation of      @CAPS1, most books are meant to tell either fictional stories  or historical events that aren't meant to offend anyone. Fictional books are meant to fill the mind of whoever reads them with tales and mental images of a story created by the author. Also, historical books are meant to capture the events of our past so that people @MONTH1 be able to look back on these events both now and in the future.        In all, the idea of censoring libraries is a negative proposal. Books were meant to provide historical accounts and fictional stories to enrigh the minds of readers, not poison them with bad content. Everyone has their own views, which is why people should learn to respect the views of different books no matter how offensive the material @MONTH1 be to them.I was a lion in my winter..All good people asleep tonight   I'm all by myself in your silverlight   I would gaze at your face the whole night..I'm sittin' here stoned, at Tortilla Jo's   Nobody knows my name and that's alright with me..Stop haunting me now   Can't shake you no how      Just leave me alone   I've got those Monday blues   Straight through Sunday blues   Good morning heartache      Here we go again   Good morning heartache   You're the one who knew me well   Might as well get used to you      Hangin' around   Good morning heartache   Sit down.Welcome to the new age, to the new age..Making two possibilities a reality,   Predicting the future of things we all know,   Fighting off the diseased programming   Of centuries, centuries, centuries, centuries      Science fails to recognize the single most   Potent element of human existence   Letting the reigns go to the unfolding   Is faith, faith, faith, faith      Science has failed our world   Science has failed our Mother Earth      Science fails to recognize the single most   Potent element of human existence   Letting the reigns go to the unfolding   Is faith, faith, faith, faith      Science has failed our world   Science has failed our Mother Earth..My indiscreet heart, longs for a sweetheart,   That I left in ol' Monterey!.There's a feast waiting for you   And you've never even gotten a taste   It's later than you think and   A kiss is a terrible thing to waste   A kiss is a terrible thing to waste.Chain chain chain (chain chain chain)   Chain chain chain (chain chain chain)   Chain chain chain, chain of fools      For five long years   I thought he was my man, you know, yes I did   But I found out, uha   I'm just a link in his chain, yes I was   He held me where he wanted me   I was nothing but his fool, oh yeah   He treated me mean, yeah   He treated me cruel, allright      Both:   Chain chain chain (chain chain chain)   Chain chain chain (chain chain chain)   Chain chain chain, chain of fools      Mariah:   Now every chain (every chain) has got a weak link   I might be weak, but I gave you strength   Oh yeah   (Uh uh)   Af:   He tell me to leave him alone   My father said, ""She can come on home""   My doctor said, ""Take it easy""   But his lovin' was much too strong   I'm wedded to him      Both:   Chain chain chain (chain chain chain)   Chain chain chain (chain chain chain)   Chain chain chain, chain of fools      Af: One of these mornings   Mariah: That chain is gonna break   Af: Yes it is   Mariah: But up until then I'm gonna take all I can take   Oh      Both:   Chain chain chain (chain chain chain)   Chain chain chain (chain chain chain)   Chain chain chain, chain of fools      Uuuh yeah      Mariah: Oh hail the Queen Of Soul, Aretha Franklin!.I won't let you down...

"Have you ever wanted something removed from the shelves of a library because you thought it was offensive? If so, how did you go about the situation and what did you want done about it? I know in my experiences I have found some things that were offensive, so I am sure that they are out there. I think there are so many rules, qualifications, or standards that can give someone reason to take something off a shelf, and those can be different for everyone.      If you were in a children's library or a school library, I am sure most people would agree that any book with offensive language, situations, opinions, etc. should be removed from the shelves. Now if you were in a public library in the teenage or adult section and those same books that were inappropriate for the children's library are in the teenage or adult section, that might be admissable. The audience is different; therefore, the types of literature, music, movies, etc. can be more opinionated, mature, and controversial. Part of why something should come off of a shelf depends on who is going to be reading it or listening to it.     In my opinion, there is a fine line as to what can be considered too controversial or too mature. @CAPS1 is one reason why I think there should be censorship because some things are definitely too controversial or mature. Although, I also think there should be guidelines, and perhaps rules, on what should be allowed on shelves and what should not because some things might be on the edge of the line, but depending on what it is it can be, for example, a learning tool or great read.     As Katherine Paterson said, 'But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf-that work I abhor-then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else.' @CAPS1 is why I think there should be guidelines or rules. If everyone had the right to remove something from a shelf, there might not be anything left to read or listen to. Different things are offensive to different people. If there were rules or guidelines, that would ensure there would still be things to read and listen to in the future.     I think there should be censorship in libraries. Some pieces of work are just too offensive, and they need to be taken off the shelves. I think it would be appropriate for some rules to be developed or some guidelines to be created. As Paterson stated, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf.'.Peggy sue got married not long ago..Give me   sorrow, I break it into love..I'd like to see you happy.Every now and then....I got a feelin' called the blues, oh Lord, since my baby said goodbye   Lord I don't know what I'll do, all I do is sit and sigh ""Oh Lord""   That last long day she said goodbye, well Lord I thought I would cry   She'll do me, she'll do you, she's got that kinda lovin'   Lord I love to hear her when she calls me sweet daddy   Such a beautiful dream, I hate to think it's all over   I've lost my heart it seems, I've grown so used to you somehow   Well I'm nobody's sugar daddy now   And I'm lonesome, I got the love sick blues      Well I'm in love, I'm in love with a beautiful gal   That's what's the matter with me   I'm in love, I'm in love with a beautiful gal   But she don't care about me   Lord I've tried and I've tried to keep her satisfied   But she just wouldn't stay   So now that she is leavin', this is all I can say      I've got a feelin' called the blues, oh Lord, since my baby said goodbye   Lord I don't know what I'll do, all I do is sit and sigh, ""Oh Lord""   That last long day she said goodbye, well Lord I thought I would cry   She'll do me, she'll do you, she's got that kinda lovin'   Lord I love to hear her when she calls me sweet daddy   Such a beautiful dream, I hate to think it all over   I've lost my heart, it seems, I've grown so used to you somehow   Well I'm nobody's sugar daddy now   And I'm lonesome, I got the love sick blues.I've seen the needle and the damage done   Oh a little part of us in everyone   I've seen the needle and the damage done   A little part, little part, little part   I've seen the needle   Oh I   I've seen the needle   Seen the needle and the damage done   A little part of us in everyone   Every junkie's like a setting sun.London is mine, New York and Paris shall fall   One Ring to Rule in Darkness to bind them all   Come to me now a moth to the Flame   Burning your eyes as you stare   With the Blood of the Salnts      Stand on the shore watching the ships as they burn   None will be found the sea will be their final urn   Come to me now a moth to the Flame   Burning your eyes as you stare   I will devour a Specter of Power I will be King for a Day      In passion denicd you call to the gods   In gluttinous sin your face so sublime   With the Blood of the Saints.He'll find me fighting back the terrible force,   'Cause I'm not afraid to die alone..There's you lying on the quilt..That I look onto,   Kiss me on my cheek,   Taking advantage..Compromise...

"What is @CAPS1, @CAPS1 is whay made this country the who we are today! There are manny ways people can exspress them self in todays world, and it just so happens the art of writing acting and art are a huge part to the way people exspress them self. Because all of us are different and have our different veiws on the subjuct. Im not going to preach to you about what is right and what is wrong. im just going to share a few prior exspereances. Now all of theas were from being in a libraries. Some of them in smaller towns, others in the hart of a larger city. There is evean a story of a man and wife, in the suburbs of a larger city. It is also amazing to see what is exsepted in differeant parts of our country.      Well it all started when I was sitting at a small table in the back of the @LOCATION1 librarie. It was a small groupe of friends and we were all working on our reaserch papers. But we then saw a man and a woman, what I proseaved as husband and wife. They were looking at the magazines on the shelf directly infront of us. As he picked up a @CAPS2 @CAPS3 magazin she looked over to him and proclamed, that is so derogitory against woman. So he put it down and walked out. Wandering what was so bad about this magazin I walked over to the rack to see a woman standing in her underware with a classic car. About a mounth later I was walking in my local librare droping off some books for my mom. Instantly when opening the door I hear to people having a heated conversation about the painting they had hanging on the back wall, in the adult section. Wich was of a woman with her chest exsposed, now mind you this was not a modern painting it was rather old, with the paint slowly  pealing off. Now that painting was there for manny years with out any one saying any thing and that was the argument made by the head librarean. There were manny people standing in the area that this was taking place, and manny of them were not evean willing to hear what the woman had to say, because the painting turned out to be very famous and has been there since before some of the middle aged people in there could reamber.      As you can see there are manny differant veiws on what is exsepted in the modern time. Advertizement is all over and manny magazines use peoples bodys to draw people to their add, so they can try to sell their product. I belive there should be a line drawn when it comes to that kind of addvertzing. They @MONTH1 have to come to a agreement that each magazine should say if it contains the kind of adult content like that. if they were to make this a law they should have to put it right in the front cover so you know if you pic that magazine up, you are at risk of seeing things like that. altho when it comes to a painting of times before the @DATE1 and people had grown up in that same area for years and have been seeing this painting since they were yong too, I do not think that painting should have been taken off the wall. There is a fine line when it comes to the information being exseptible or not that is why I do belive there should be some kind of rating system whith the book and etc.Please just come back home   No,

There's a sinner in my bones   And there's a joker in my head   There are secrets in my soul   And there are sorries that I have never said      But there's a time to dance   Time to laugh   Time to cry   Time to go   Time to grieve   Time to come      Oh, I still got time to cope   Time to hope   Time to play   Time to grow   But for now I gotta walk alone   I gotta walk alone      There's a tight rope that I've been walking   There's a daisy in my hair   There's a heartbreak that has taught me   Of what is raging   And there's only love and fear      There's a sadness in my confessions   There's a healer howling at the moon   And there's a gypsy in me that keeps on roaming   And there's a an anger as I get closer to the truth      But there's a time to dance   Time to laugh   Time to cry   Time to go   Time to grieve   Time to come      Oh, I still got time to cope   Time to hope   Time to play   Time to grow   But for now I gotta walk alone   I gotta walk alone   I gotta walk alone   I've got to walk alone   But for now I gotta walk alone      Oh, I hear the thunder but I won't back down   A soldier marches through the wrong side of town   I'm gonna love you until I bleed   And that's the story of me   I gotta walk alone      If they say time is everything   There's a time to dance   Time to laugh   Time to cry   Time to go   Time to grieve   Time to come      Oh, I still got time to cope   Time to hope   Time to play   Time to grow   Now I gotta walk alone   I've got to walk alone   I've got to walk alone   I gotta walk alone   For now I gotta walk alone.[Chorus]"
"@PERSON1 is saying we shall all share then never giving @CAPS4 back. Also we can't all get what we want at the sametime or at all. If that book is popular then they should of bought more to sell for the other people that doesn't have the book and would like to have @CAPS4.      Of course sharing is better then wasting your money on something when someone has the book that you know and would let you barrow @CAPS4. And yes, We all know that most people these days don't usually share.      To tell you the truth you don't always get what you want. Either get over @CAPS4.      Yea @PERSON2 has a @CAPS1 but to tell you the truth everybody has there own opinion.     We all don't have to listen to what other's say but if you agree with that person then you agree.      Like I said everybody has there own opinion and I stated mine.Pretty much like '@CAPS1 OF @CAPS2.'      No, I do not believe that books,music, and etc. should be taken off the shelves because @CAPS3 @CAPS4's stupid you'll lose your job and @CAPS5 people out there in the world need something to do @CAPS6!?     I don't read I mostly listen to music because I think music to me is more interesting and entertaning then reading a book. I mean yea I read articles from magazines but like I said mostly listen to music.     Reading a book is mostly like someone telling you a story about so and so or somthing . So to me @CAPS7 book is in infront of @CAPS7 face @NUM1. '@CAPS7 life'     @CAPS8 later on in @CAPS7 life I will be interested in reading a book but now I'm enjoying @CAPS7 life being a teenager.     So basically I'm telling you @CAPS7 own opinion and I think @CAPS4's completely stupid for being graded for this because everybody has there own opinion just saying.     You could either agree or disagree but for this @CAPS4's mostly a disagree.Isn't he a strange one?.Eternal night encroaches   Disaster speaks his name   Ignite the fires of Hades   A world engulfed in

"Throughout history there have been many books written at a time in history when their beliefs on certain things differed from what our world today believes. Things that have changed as our world has changed are the views on slavery, womens rights, religion, and many other things. These views are based on what most people of a time frame believed. I feel that just because something someone wrote or said offends someone, does not give people the right to ban that book or quote from society as a whole. They have the right to ban it from themselves, but it is up to each individual whether or not it is banned for everyone.      Our government gives us the right to have freedom of speech. This shows that even though someone @MONTH1 write or speak out against the majority opinion, they can say whatever they want without being punished for it. This means that people can not just ban something for what it might say or portray. In my life explicit music seems to be something that some people are trying to ban. My parents believe that I am at the right age that I should be allowed to listen to whatever type of music I want to.      I feel that public libraries can set age restrictions on items based off language, nudity, and other inappropriate things for children just as movie theaters do, but they do not have the right to ban books. Even though there is an age restriction, as long as the guardian of the child direct says it is fine if his/her child @MONTH1 check out the book or the parent checks out the book for the child, then it is fine that that child gets that book. The choice for what is appropriate for that each child should be left up to their parents.      If libraries had to ban books because someone said that a certain book or magazine was offensive, then a library would have very few to no books. In almost all of books someone @MONTH1 be able to find something offensive to them or to someone else. These books that offend people should be kept on the shelf so that people can understand how society's views on things were back in the time period that the book was written. These items in libraries that are found offensive shows us what was wrong with society at that time and helps us learn from past mistakes in history and how to avoid them. For example, in the play A @ORGANIZATION1 it shows how the society's view of women was. It showed that they did not think highly of women and how there purpose in life were to raise the children and that was it. They did not feel that they had the intellect to talk about science or anything like that. This indirectly teaches us how we should not treat women today.       If libraries start to ban books, music, movies, magazines or other items then they are hiding things they do not want people to read. Libraries should not be able to ban something because it is offensive, but they have the right to put age restrictions on certain things. Authors and artists have freedom of speech to say whatever they want and libraries can not take that away from them.If you love me, like you tell me   Please be careful with my heart   You can take it, just don't break it   Or my world will fall apart   You are my first romance, and I'm willing to take a chance   That til life is through, I'll still be loving you   I will be true to you, just a promise from you will do   From the very start, please be careful with my heart      I love you and you know I do   There'll be no one else for me   Promise I'll be always true, for the world and all to see   Love has heard some lies softly spoken   And I have had my heart badly broken   I've been burned and I've been hurt before   So I know just how you feel, trust my love is real for you   I'll be gentle with your heart, I'll caress it like the morning dew   I'll be right beside you forever   I won't let our world fall apart   From the very start, I'll be careful with your heart      You are my first (and you are my last) romance   And I'm willing to take a chance (I've learned from the past)   That til life is through, I'll still be loving you   I will be true to you (only to you)   Just a promise from you will do   From the very start (from the very start)   From the very start (from the very start)   Please be careful with (I'll be careful with)   (Your) (my) heart.""Day after day, day after day,   We stuck nor breath nor motion   As idle as a painted ship upon a painted ocean   Water, water everywhere and   All the boards did shrink   Water, water everywhere nor any drop to drink."".Traded in my bible for a little black cat   The time of Armageddon's here   Some call me the son of the morning   God knows I'm the angel of light      I drink my water from a wolf's footprint   My soul's redemptive work of Christ   God knows I'm the angel of light      Speak of the Devil   Speak of the Devil   Devil      Believers be on guard   Be strong and take a stand   The time of Armageddon's here   Some call me the son of the morning      Speak of the Devil   Speak of the Devil   Speak of the Devil   Speak of the Devil   Speak of the Devil   Speak of the Devil   Speak of the Devil   Speak of the Devil   Devil, devil.While shepherds watch their flocks by night,   They see a bright new shining star,   They hear a choir sing a song,   The music seemed to come from afar..Catch me in the hood pimp, rollin' on a gar   I plead to the Judge, I'm guilty of the charge   Imma balla-holic, can't help it Imma star   You see the yellow ice, you holla , oh my God!.Don't leave me here again..I don't wanna be your slave..I wondered how you felt about it""   I'm so happy that I can't stop crying,   I'm so happy I'm laughing through my tears..The one who gave, his life for me!.at any rate, for this elite I have   An ancient irish ballad, which was written a few years ago, and which is replete with all the accoutrements of this art form..Bird on wing goes floating by,   But there's a teardrop in his eye,   One summer dream, one summer dream..You can't begin to feel, can't begin to feel,   Can't begin to feel   So fuck you..Tonight's the night I'm dressing up for you..To have, to hold..So what the hell gives you the right to look at me,   As if to say ""Hell, what went wrong?"".Just- no more..Revolution in their minds -

"Read, @CAPS1, and @CAPS2 ?     Books, music, and movies all have a meaning and a purpose to them. In our spare time, we all enjoy to read, @CAPS1, and @CAPS2 the things that let us do so. These things keeps us all occupied when theres alot of time to spare. The library is a place where you can go read in peace and @CAPS1 to music with no distractions or anything, but there are somethings that are not cut out for the library.          People find books at the library that they find very interesting and decides to check them out, but little do they know what the book and/or magazine has in it. Books come in all different genres and so do music and movies. And we all have our own views in what type of genre we enjoy listening, reading or watching.           Genre comes in all kind of different types. For example, theres only one certain type of book for a child and which at the library should be picked out for a child to read and a child only. Theres also books for grown adults and adults only and once checked out, it should be kept from a childs hand or vision. Because children could see the wrong things and things might get out of hand.     All readings, music, or movies that have explicit or uncensored graphics or words should personally have their own section in the library. In this case, nothing bad could happen and everything is in place with everything else. Honestly all media actually should have their own section. For example, all kids media should be in one section and all adult media should be in another section.          All books should be left on the shelves of every library, only because one knows what should be read and what shouldn't be read. A kids desired book is a childrens book with color and picture while on the other hand, an adult has their own type of selection. So books should stay where they belong and not tooken down from any self, that also goes for, movies, music, or any other media.The road is long,   With many a winding turn   That leads us to   Who knows where, who knows where   But I'm strong, strong enough to carry him   He ain't heavy, he's my brother      So on we go,   His welfare is my concern   No burden is he to bare,   We'll get there   For I know he would not encumber me   He ain't heavy, he's my brother      If I'm laden at all,   I'm laden with sadness   That everyone's heart isn't filled   With gladness of love for one another   It's a long long road   From which there is no return   While we're on our way to there, why not share   And the load,   It doesn't weigh me down at all   He ain't heavy, he's my brother   He ain't heavy, he's my brother,   He's my brother, he's my brother.[guitar solo]   To be crucified..Horses are creatures who worship the earth   They gallop on feet of ivory   Constrained by the wonder of dying and birth   The horses still run they are free   My body is merely the shell of my soul   But the flesh must be given its due   Like a pony that carries its rider back home   Like an old friend that's tried and been true      I had a vision of eagles and horses   High on a ridge in a race with the wind   Going higher and higher and faster and faster   On eagles and horses I'm flying again,      Eagles inhabit the heavenly heigths   They know neither limit nor bound   They're the guardian angels of darkness and light   They see all and hear every sound   My spirit will never be broken or caught   For the soul is a free-flying thing   Like an eagle that needs neither comfort nor thought   To rise up on glorious wings      I had a vision of eagles and horses   High on a ridge in a race with the wind   Going higher and higher and faster and faster   On eagles and horses I'm flying again,   I'm flying again, I'm flying again      My body is merely the shell of my soul   But the flesh must be given its due   Like a pony that carries its master back home   Like an old friend that's tried and been true   My spirit will never be broken or caught   For the soul is a free-flying thing   Like an eagle that needs neither comfort nor thought   To rise up on glorious wings      I had a vision of eagles and horses   High on a ridge in a race with the wind   Going higher and higher and faster and faster   On eagles and horses I'm flying again,   I'm flying again, I'm flying again.I'm pretty when I cry..He can't pass on you   Oh no, I see far right through you..I'm in love, I'm in love,   Love in a hurricane..Yooou can't stop!).I'd beg for you dance for you      But you left me you beat me      Na na na na na na      But you left me you beat me      Na na na na na na      'cause i'd beg for you dance for you      'cause i'd beg for you dance for you      And after all      The way you locked at me that day      You make me fell so blind      Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh      Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh      Say na na....Yeah   Am I everything ya need?.Gone..Lovin', little Miss..Will you call them freaks?.Baby when I think about (about, about)   The day that we first met (the day that we first met)   Wasn't lookin' for what I found   But I found you   And I'm bound to by happiness in being around you      [Chorus]   I'm glad when I'm makin' love to you   I'm glad for the way you make me feel   I love it cause you seem to blow my mind every time   I'm glad when I walk you hold my hand   I'm happy that you know how to be a man   I'm glad that you came into my life   I'm so glad      I dig the way that you get down   (You get down for 'bout)   And you still know how to hold me   (And you still know how to hold me)   Perfect blend, masculine   I think I'm in love, damn finally      [Chorus]      I'm glad, that you, turned out, to be   That certain someone special   Who makes this life worth living   I'm glad, you're here, just loving me   So say that you won't leave   Cause since the day you came   I've been glad      [Chorus].I'm a survivor but I'm reaching my low,   But I'm not ready to die..His arm now like coild s-s-s-snakes   Whips all the bottles that he's drunken,   Like crystal-skittles about the cabin,   Of a ship they'd bin sailing   Five years sunken....Well the lady don't mind..farther down   Feelin?.Oh yeah yeah...

Other reasons is because people are gonna home and watch it online or on tv so how is it gonna make a difference. It is not goiing to make one difference at all..Closed my eyes and waited for the pain to pass,   Recalled a little story heard today      Yeah, I'm feeling trapped,   So locked away,   Caught in a downward spiral   In, into the black,   I won't be back,   Yeah I'll be here a while      Don't need to see, your face..Well, I've been lookin' all over   For a gal like you,   I can't find nobody   So you'll have to do..Schlaf' in himmlischer ruh..Will the memories fade or will they linger?.No use in trying, the damage is done   What have I done, oh, my beautiful son      The deal has bead sealed, sucked inward to hell   I keep locked these secrets so no one can tell   Awake and you'll find that you're looking through the eyes   Of a man-made evil monster      Ooh oh oh Evil be thy master   Ooh oh oh The man has evil monsters   Ooh oh oh Evil be thy master      Whoah oh oh ooh!.Yes, they fly, fly by my window..Never be lonely..My mouth is dry   My legs are weak   I'm thinkin' this 'cause I can't speak   I'm lookin at you lookin' at me   You must think that I'm just crazy      If you only knew what you're putting me through!.You lie in the heat of a summer haze   And turn it into a winter's tale   You fall back into the english way   Of feeling only guilt 'cause you feel no pain   You're crying and pleading and you're hell just to be with   And you're everything that I'll ever need   So why do you say you love me when you don't?.While chanting the praises of the Mother Goddess,   A refusal of betrayal, women were dying to be free..I know that fan is moving air, I can see it in your hair   But I can't bear to breathe it in somehow   I'll rise and fall with you 'cause you can't fail me now   I'll rise and fall with you 'cause you can't fail me now      Salt is sweet upon my mouth   And dark throws sparks against my house   The stain of love's a smudge on my brow   But you see through me and you can't fail me now   You see right through me, you can't fail me now      I've bit off more than I can chew   It's something that I tend to do   When fewer words are what we need and how   You bite my tongue, you can't fail me now   I rant and rail but you can't fail me now      I've lost the thread among the vines   And hung myself in story lines   That tell the tales I never would allow   God knows the name of every bird   It fills my mind like angry words   But you know all my secret heart avows      We're taught to love the worst of us   And mercy more than life but trust me   Mercy's just a warning shot across the bow   I live for yours and you can't fail me now   I live for your mercy,   You can't fail me now   You can't fail me now.On the east side that's where I met my Ramona   ""I wanna go to a party"", That's what she said   Lonely, that's what I've been here's my telephone number, call me   And to a party, a house party   Whole loop a people just rally around me   And love, she send a message of love   She said, ""I love up the way you move, I love the way you rap""   Ramona please step back   Now she's my Ruca, I'm barely waiting for my Heina   She moved from Long Beach down to LA   Right now she's selling oranges by the freeway   I wanna know, Ramona am I the only one?.I know she's dead and long, gone..Baby I'm coming better ready yourself   Be looking for me 'cause I'm the real thing   (oh) and I'mma coming   Baby I'm coming, better ready yourself   Be looking for me 'cause I'm the real thing      And I'm coming   If I want you   I'm gonna get you   Ain't no question   Since I met you   If I want you   (If I want you)   I'm gonna get you   (I'm gonna get you)   Ain't no question   (Ain't no question)      Baby since I met you ooh ooh ooh   If I want you   I'm gonna get you   Ain't no question   Baby since I met you   If I want you   I'm gonna get you   Ain't no question      Baby since I met you   Baby, I'm coming better ready yourself   Cause I-I-I-I-I'm the real thing   (wooh)   And I'mma coming   Baby, I'm coming, better ready yourself   Be looking for me 'cause I'm the real thing   (yeah)   And I'mma coming   Baby, I'm coming, better ready yourself   Be looking for me 'cause I'm the real thing   (Ohh)   Baby, I'm coming, better ready yourself   Be looking for me 'cause I'm the real thing.In the name of higher consciousness   I let the best man I knew go   'Cause it's nice to love and be loved   But it's better to know all you can know   I said it's nice to love and be loved   But I'd rather know what God knows   Oh no, oh no, oh no....Smoke   Lingers 'round your fingers   Train   Heave on - to Euston   Do you think you've made   The right decision this time   Oh...   You left   Your tired family grieving   And you think they're sad because you're leaving   But did you see jealousy in the eyes   Of the ones who had to stay behind   And do you think you've made   The right decision this time   You left   Your girlfriend on the platform   With this really ragged notion that you'll return   But she knows   That when he goes   He really goes   And do you think you've made   The right decision this time.I really wanna feel,   Wanna feel your love..Got an AK-47, well you know it makes me feel alright   Got an Uzi by my pillow, helps me sleep a little better at night   There's no feeling any greater   Than to shoot first and ask questions later   Now I'm trigger happy, trigger happy every day      Well, you can't take my guns away, I got a constitutional right   Yeah, I gotta be ready if the Commies attack us tonight   I'll blow their brains out with my Smith and Wesson   That ought to teach them all a darn good lesson   Now I'm trigger happy, trigger happy every day      (Oh yeah, I'm)trigger, trigger happy   Yes I'm trigger, trigger happy   (Oh baby, I'm)trigger, trigger happy   Yes I'm trigger, trigger happy   (Oh I'm so)trigger, trigger happy   Yes I'm trigger, trigger happy   Better watch out, punk, or I'm gonna have to blow you away      Oh, I accidentally shot daddy last night in the den   I mistook him in the dark for a drug-crazed Nazi again   Now why'd you have to get so mad?.A slow burning, smoldering love for you and I..But you just love that woman   So much it's a shame and a sin..And give your life to never die?.Bound at every limb by my shackles of fear   Sealed with lies through so many tears   Lost from within, pursuing the end   I fight for the chance to be lied to again      You never were strong enough   You you never were good enough   You were never conceived in love   You will not rise above      [Chorus]   They'll never see   I'll never be   I'll struggle on and on to feed this hunger   Burning deep inside of me      But through my tears breaks a blinding light   Birthing a dawn to this endless night   Arms outstretched, awaiting me   An open embrace upon a bleeding tree      Rest in me and I'll comfort you   I have lived and I died for you   Abide in me and I vow to you   I will never forsake you      [Chorus: x2]"
"I feel that books, music, movies, and magazines should not be removed from shelves. Just because some one @MONTH1 finds them offensive. They only become offensive when people think they are.     I feel this way because no one is forcing any ony to watch or read any thing they dont want to. No one is telling sudents what they can and can't watch or read. Every one has the choice. To choose what they want to read or watch.      what one person @MONTH1 find offensive and wrang. Another person. @MONTH1 find interesting and exiting. I have felt the same way before, but that still gives me no resone to take it off the shelf. The next person after me. Has as much the same right as I did. The person has the right to watch or read what I have. To like or hate what ever is on the shelves.     There are lots of things in a @CAPS5. Other than things that people @MONTH1 find offensive. There are scary books like '@CAPS1 @CAPS2.' @CAPS3 @ORGANIZATION2 best selling auther, @PERSON2. There are mistury books like 'The @ORGANIZATION1.' @CAPS3 another @ORGANIZATION2 best selling auther, @PERSON1.     So to some up my esay. Nothing sould be taken off @CAPS5 shelves.

"I believe that if something or someone offends you, you have the right to take a stand. You shouldn't have to deal with it. If something is offensive in your library, it has no right to be there. A library is supposed to be a helpfull place. Who would want to sit back and watch a raciest movie? Who would want to have a little kid watching something sexual in a movie? Magazines can even develope a lot of problems. Muisc can be straight offensive.      If a young adult or a child reads or watches a movie that is raciest, it teaches them bad things. Racism is a very hurtful thing. What you see or read can really have an affect on you. You @MONTH1 not realise that it is wrong. It could have you saying hurtful things to a differant race. If a person isn't raciest and they see something that is, it could offend them. They @MONTH1 feel like they 'cool'. They go out and say raciest things. It makes them feel good. Later on they feel guilty. All because of a movie or book. If a movie is making fun of your race, it hurts. Being made fun of hurts. It is technicly bullying. Bullying can lead to suicide. Who cares if someone is black or white? We are all the same deep down inside. Movies like this should be banned from public libraries.      Movies today can have pretty much anything they want in them. Sex, drugs, cursing, etc. Kids can get by with watching them without anyone saying anything. The librarian just swipes your card, then you have the movie.They @MONTH1 not know right from wrong. If they see someone doing drugs or having sex, they might think that it is cool. They @MONTH1 go out and do it. We do not need movies like this in our public library. We should make it a lot harder for kids to try to get movies like this. These moives can also offend us. Make us feel uncool. Make us feel like we have to go out and try it.      In magizines today, they make everyone look so perfect. These people can offend you. Young teenage girls or even boys are the ones mostly looking at magizines. If you see @PERSON1 in a magizine, you begin to want to look like her. You see how skinny she is. She is tan. She has perfect skin. Its normal for someone to be jeleous. We are only human. Sometimes these images get to us. We @MONTH1 starve ourselves to try to be skinny. That can be very dangerous to your health. These girls knock our confidence down. Into today's society, people stive for popularity. They want to look perfect. They want all the guys to stair. We use the girls in the magizine to helps us know what we want to look like. You should love who you are and what you look like. You are unique. No one has to be skinny to be pretty. Magizines can be offensive.      In today's society music is horrible. Rap, country, or rock music. Some of the lyrics can really offend people. The words get in your head everytime you hear the song. If you really take the time to look up lyrics to a song, you will realise that they will let you say anything. I can't name how many songs I know, just beeing a teenager, that make fun of something. For example, there is a song by the band @ORGANIZATION1. It is called 'I must be emo'. It makes fun of people who are unique in their own way. Some lines from the song are, '@CAPS1 I get depressed, I cut my wrists in every direction'. How can you make fun of someone who does self harm. Depression and self harm are a big thing in today's society. Their is nothing funny about it. If someone who hurts themselves hears this, think of what could happen. It would really offend them! They could go and cut theirselves even more. They could try suicide. In the song it also makes fun of gay people. It makes fun of the way 'emo' people look. 'I look like I am dead and dress like a homo', is another line from the song. I don't know about you but to me that would be terribly offensive! We need to get these types of songs out of our libraries.      We should have a say to what is in our public library. The library is ment to be a good place. Anyone can go their. We are all unique in our own ways. If something is offensive to you, you have the right to stand up for yourself. We need to make offensive books, movies, magazines, etc., harder to get a hold of..Share my love   Let the love shine between us forever      Share my love with you my darling together.Well, I told you pretty baby, such a long time ago,   If I found you with another, well I'd walk right out your door..Is this what you wanted...

"I believe that certain materials such as books, music, movies, magazines and other thing can be removed from the shelf. I believe that when we are cleaning off the shelf that @CAPS1 should be removed from the shelf. Other times I don't belive they should be removed form the shelf unless you're cleaning up.      I'm a @CAPS2. I'm always trying to do the right thing. And everyday my parents have chores for me to do around the house and I believe that those should be done first insted of doing other things. And I think it's crazy to remove books and other things from a shelf unless a shelf a full of books and other things. And its something that would have to be done.      Removing anything from the shelf is not bad. But it is not something that had to be done all the time. It is something that some people might do. It is not my thing.  I'm always trying to be obedient and have good behavior around others.Anytime anytime anytime anytime you want me,   Come on back, come on home..you're my life's one miracle   everything I've done that's good   and you break my heart with tenderness   and I confess it's true   I never knew a love like this 'til you   you're the reason I was born   now I finally know for sure   and I'm overwhelmed with happiness   so blessed to hold you close   the one that I love most   though the future has so much for you in store   who could ever love you more?.You've got to learn   It's up to you   If you can learn   That the dream just might come true      Take a look at my face   I am the future   How do you like what you see?.I watched Him as He struggled,   I watched Him as He fell,   The cross came down upon His back,   The crowd began to yell,   In that moment I felt such agony,   In that moment I felt such loss,   Till a Roman soldier grabbed my arm   and screamed, ""you, carry His cross""..[Chorus: x2]   Come Mr. DJ song pon de replay   Come Mr. DJ won't you turn the music up   All the gal pon the dance floor wantin' some more what   Come Mr. DJ won't you turn the music up      It goes one by one even two by two   Everybody on the floor let me show you how we do   Lets go dip it low then you bring it up slow   Wind it up 1 time wind it back once more      Run, run, run, run   Everybody move run   Lemme see you move and   Rock it til the grooves done      Shake it til the moon becomes the sun (Sun)   Everybody in the club give me a run (Run)   If you ready to move say it (Yeah Yeah)   One time for your mind say it (Yeah Yeah)      Well I'm ready for ya   Come let me show ya   You want to groove I'ma show you how to move   Come come      [Chorus: x2]      Hey Mr..We don't like it   We don't like it   We're from the factory and we've come to play..Out here in the country where the weather gets so mean   She thinks about the places that she ain't never seen   She knows that she's married but she can't remember why   And she wonders what it might feel like with some other guy      And though she's hotter than an oven   Just to fill your lovin' cup   If a man answers, you better hang up      You better hang up   You better hang up   You better hang up   You better hang up      You're from New York City where they don't say no prayers   Anything goes and nobody cares   And the country girl might thrill ya but you better pass her by   'Cause her ol' man love to kill ya for the look that's in your eye      And though you're hotter than an oven   Just to fill her lovin' cup   If a man answers, you better hang up      You better hang up   You better hang up   You better hang up   You better hang up   You better hang up   You better hang up   You better hang up   You better hang up.You don't get them girls loose loose (TJR!).Blind in my one good eye   My mind just won't reply   Somethin' from way down south   Kinda formin' a dust in my mouth   Lookin' for a place to hide   Lookin' for a space to die   Rattlin' like an old tin can   I'm cruisin' like a laundry van   Hot 'n' cold fever down to my knees   Wearin' out all of my rosary beads      Can't shake those shakes   Can' t shake those shakes no more   Can't shake those shakes   Feels like I'm dyin' when I'm already dead      Date with my medicine man   He got the remedies I understand   Gotta find the price to pay   Gonna send me on my way   Gotta desperate need, gotta feed the fire   I got a chemical love and a burned out desire      Can't shake those shakes   Can't shake those shakes no more   Can't shake those shakes, eels like I'm dyin'   When I'm already dead, I'm dead..Ikaw ang bigay ng maykapal   Tugon sa aking dasal   Upang sa lahat ng panahon   Bawat pagkakataon   Ang ibigin ay ikaw      Ikaw ang tanglaw sa aking mundo   Kabiyak nitong puso ko   Wala ni kahati mang saglit   Na sa iyo'why may papalit   Ngayo't kailanma'why ikaw      Ang lahat ng aking galaw   Ang sanhi ay ikaw   Kung may bukas mang tinatanaw   Dahil may isang ikaw   Kulang ang magpakailanpaman   Upang bawat sandali ay   Upang muli't muli ay   Ang mahalin ay ikaw.?

"Should a library be able to remove a book or a movie from its shelves if someone happens to find it offensive? I believe that the answer to that question should be no, because everyone in the world could find something in a library that could be considered obscene or offensice. However, if a library decides to remove every  piece of literature or art in its possession that someone finds offensive, the walls and shelves of its core would be bare.          I'm sure you have seen and heard many people who have been offended by silly things such as children's novels, pictures in magazines, and song lyrics. I know I have seen people who have become livid because of how offeneded a piece of literature or art has made them. But with seeing such reactions, I've come to the conclusion that what someone @MONTH1 find offensive, another person could find beautiful. For example, paintings of nude men and women are looked at as wrong and disturbing by some and are also seen as masterpieces by others. Everyone has their own opinions about things but it's not the library's job to worry about which opinions are wrong or right.           There is really no way to avoid offending someone without completely clearing the walls and shelves of a library. Simply anything could be seen as offensive to anyone. I know that I've personally found some books on the @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 to be disturbing because of how graffic they are. However, that doesn't mean other people shouldn't be able to read something a young woman found offensive. Offensive pieces of literature and art are often the best kinds because they evoke emotions in people, although maybe not the intened emotions, and make people think. You learn a lot when you're looking at something that has put strong emotions into you.       With everthing going on in our society and culure today, in the @LOCATION1 and around the world, someone is bound to be offened everyday by something. Religious groups @MONTH1 be offened by the way a cover of a book is drawn or the pictures in a teen magazine and politcal leaders @MONTH1 be offended by what journalists are writing about them. You see, there is simply no way to avoid offending people. To me, it's truly surprising that libraries are still worrying about censorship when television shows are showing sex, drugs, and violence. People are obviously getting offened by what television shows are airing but, see, that's just it. The television shows are still being aired. Offensive or not, people are still watching, just as people are still reading books, looking at pictures, listening to music, that someone, at some point, has found offenseive.      If a library decides to take out every offensive piece of literature and art what would be left? My friends, the answer is nothing. A beautiful creation to you @MONTH1 bring back horrific memories to someone else but that doesn't make it a bad creation. A novel that makes your stomach turn in knots @MONTH1 teach you more than you've ever learned before in your whole entire life. I hope people realize that just because something is offensive to someone doesn't make it wrong. Just because someone decided that they thought a piece of literature or art was not what they wanted to see or read doesn't give them the right to deprive someone else of the chance to read or see it.  As you can clearly see, libraries shouldn't waste their time on censorship, because no matter how hard you try, someone will find something that bothers them..All geeks and circus freaks   Come play with me   Pimps to bring my sex fiends   Molesting me   Round to the lust my debauchery..Some say I'm cold-blooded..It says, ""Look!.Well, I can just imagine ten thousand angels cried   That would seem like rain to me and you..Silence speaks louder than words..Said hey, Miss Ruby, can't you see   That I want you to marry me   Hey, Miss Ruby, don't you're gonna stand   That I wanna be your lovin' man   Hey, Miss Ruby, my heart's at your command..In the midst of a dream I swear I saw you standing there   In a sea of emotion with faithful devotion you were there   In heat of the night under the street lights once again   At the edge of the fire for the love of the jungle again and again, oh yeah      They can't tame the lion   Can't tame the lion   They can't tame the lion      One night in Detroit, yes I swear I saw you standing there   In a summer of dreams down by the river you were there   I remember it's all so clear   In the midst of a dream, yes I swear I say you standing there      They can't tame the lion   Can't tame the lion   They can't tame the lion      In the midst of a dream I swear I saw you standing there   In a sea of emotion with faithful devotion you were there   I remember it's all so clear   In the embers of reckless years      In the midst of a dream I swear I saw you standing there   They can't tame the lion   Can't tame the lion   They can't tame the lion   At the edge of the fire, for the love of the jungle   They can't tame the lion   Can't tame the lion   They can't tame the lion.Somehow I got to, to carry on..This cloud, this cloud--   Says ""Noah,   C'mon and build me an Ark."".When I was seventeen, it was a very good year..I love the way you stand in my way   You won't move 'til you get a kiss   And how you tell me that my name   It tastes so sweet on your lips      I love the way you hold me with your eyes   Hold me so tight that I can't move   It's like everything I've ever known is a lie   And you're the simple truth      Is it a dream or is it real?.Still be there after you're gone..And anytime you feel the pain, hey Jude, refrain,   Don't carry the world upon your shoulders..Tell me, the struggle is God and I came to build   Shit is so real, inside you distilled   Back in the form of mist   You wishin' you did the Knowledge before speakin'   Seekin', where you went wrong   And why would I bring you such physical harm?.I do not see the way out   I do not really know how   Like a shot in the dark   Went your hallowed ground   Had you taken too much   Kept me well out of touch   And refused to let me go      I cannot see to you pain   I do not hear you complain   You are now but a dot in the pouring rain   You created this mess now I'm bent to your stress   And it seems to suit you well      One and only two can be lonely   I'm my own child blessed and unholy   I your eyes the storm surely rising up   Do do do do      I do not see the way out   You cannot turn this around   Like a walk in the dark   You have weighed me down   I can't stand in your place   Can't take this away   It was all good to be true      One and only two can be lonely   I'm my own child blessed and unholy   I your eyes a storm surely rising up   Do do do do      Oh you never talk about it   No you never scream about it   You took a spirit young and whole   You turned this child into an old soul   Old soul      One and only two can be lonely   I'm my own child blessed and unholy   I your eyes a storm surely rising up   Do do do do      Oh you never talk about it   No you never scream about it   You covet things that you don't own   You turn this child into and old soul   Old sould      One and only two can be lonely   I'm my own child blessed and unholy   I your eyes a storm surely rising up      One and only two can be lonely   I'm my own child blessed and unholy   I your eyes a storm surely rising up.Voulez-vous coucher avec moi?.But there's nothing you want to give her,   And there's nothing that you really want to take..Your silent whispers, silent tears..Heroes have their names engraved forever in a stone,   Hermits have their peace of mind alone..Ooh, I burn at your touch   You got no heart, Johnny, but oh, I love you so much      Oh, at first you were kind and gentle   'Til I packed up and went off with you   And it lasted two weeks until one day   You laughed at me and hit me too   You dragged me all over the city   Up the river and down to the sea   Now I look at myself in the mirror   And some old woman looks back at me   You didn't want love, Johnny, you wanted money   I gave you all I had..And gather we on this site   To behold the power and the might..And if there's just no need to be so fucking polite."
"When walking into the library and children are finding books, movies and magazines they should not look at. It can be offensive. I believe that it is not the authors fault for the offensive language in their work. I can understand that parents can get upset if their child is reading a book they should not be looking at.     My opinion is that students should be able to choose what they want to read and if it is offensive to them they should stop reading the book. I feel that the student or adult should know if it is harmful to the student or not. Censorship in the library is to find books for everyone to read.     I think that they should not ban anything in the library because it can be used for something useful to the person. I find it hard to believe that libraries will remove every offensive book, movie, or music from shelves because the rating of the item can be horrible.     I just don't think it should be a good idea for them to ban things from libraries if they need to use the information from the book. If it offends them then they should not read the book, and choose another book. Authors work too hard for writing their book and go through the publishing process.      My opinion is a no because I feel they should not remove items off shelves of the libraries because the content of the item is not appropriete to someone. My views can vary when I am older and have children of my own someday. But as of right now I do not think they should remove items off shelves at libraries.Hela, heba, helloa..Last night I had a bad dream   That I was trapped in this city   Then I asked is that really such a bad thing?.Let me show you a movie   You know we landed a man on the moon?.Our hearts are breathing in the wonders of Your name   And we're breathing out Your praise   The more we see, we sing   The circle never ends   For Your glory never fades   And surely as the rising sun   Your love O Lord endures, Your love endures forever      From the heights of Your throne   To the depths of Your heart   Your majesty surrounds us   In the power of Your life   In the grace of Your cross   Your mercy has found us      Your power we see displayed   In all that You have made   In the sky and sea and stars   And here beneath Your cross   Your mercy speaks so loud   Speaking straight into our hearts   And surely as the rising sun   Your love O Lord endures, Your love endures forever      And the more we see, we sing   ""Holy is the name of the Lord""   And the more we see, we sing   ""There is no one like You, God""      Your majesty surrounds us   Your mercy, Lord, has found us   There is no one like You, God.I drift with Dunes,   I whisper of the tombs,   They offer me Egyptian Delights..The protocols of evil   Ravaging so many lives?.Her husband was a bruiser, played senior in Quebec,   If he'd had the rights of it, it would have been my neck..Oh!.""The gutter will be fine,"" she confesses..They paved paradise and put up a parking lot   With a pink hotel, a boutique, and a swinging hot spot   Don't it always seem to go   That you don't know what you've got till it's gone   They paved paradise and put up a parking lot   Shoo-bop-bop-bop-bop, shoo-bop-bop-bop      They took all the trees and put 'em in a tree museum   And then they charged all the people twenty-five bucks just to see 'em   Don't it always seem to go   That you don't know what you've got till it's gone   They paved paradise and put up a parking lot   Shoo-bop-bop-bop-bop, shoo-bop-bop-bop      Hey farmer, farmer, put away your DDT now   Give me spots on my apples but leave me the birds and the bees, please   Don't it always seem to go   That you don't know what you've got till it's gone   They paved paradise and put up a parking lot   I say, they paved paradise and they put up a parking lot      Don't it always seem to go   That you don't know what you've got till it's gone   They paved paradise and put up a parking lot   Shoo-bop-bop-bop-bop      Late last night I heard the screen door slam   And a big yellow taxi carried off my old man   Don't it always seem to go   That you don't know what you've got till it's gone   They paved paradise and they put up a parking lot   Shoo-bop-bop-bop-bop      Don't it always seem to go   That you don't know what you've got till it's gone   They paved paradise and put up a parking lot   Shoo-bop-bop-bop-bop      Oh, now, they paved paradise and they put up a parking lot   Shoo-bop-bop-bop-bop   Hey, steam rolled paradise and put up a parking lot   Shoo-bop-bop-bop-bop.Sun is still shining, look at the view   Moon is still dining with me and you   Now that we're out here, open your heart   To the universe of which we're a part   But if you want to play   Stay right back on Earth   Waiting for rebirth..On the side of the freeway in the car      In the car   In the car   In the car      Seven a.m. morning   Came to take us away   Little men   Big guns   Pointed at our heads      Seven a.m. morning   Came to take us away   Little men   Big guns   Pointed at our heads   At our   At our heads      Your prospect of living gone   You ran the light at dawn   Protectors on your back   Lights are on their track      You must now face authority   You're nothing like me   You must now face authority   You're nothing like me      Put your hands up   Get out of the car   Put your hands up   Get out of the car   Put your hands up   Get out of the car      Fuck   Fuck you pig   Fuck   Fuck you pig   Fuck   Fuck you pig   Fuck   Fuck you pig   Put your hands up   Get out of the car.Bought this guitar   At a shop called mars   But on the way back home   Strange things happened in my car   Started to play   All by itself   Creatures jumped from   The highest shelf   Until I touched string 12   This magnificent tree   Appeared in my mind   Even without leaves   ITS strength was divine   Synthesized gnomes   Penetrated this godly zone   Summer was thrown off   It's royal throne   This magnificent tree   Appeared in my mind   Even without leaves   It's strength was divine.Will you ever change?.[alright there, can I get a copy on a 6-14?.(Riders On The Storm -

"I think that censorship in libraries is and is not a good idea because some people wouldnt get to read what they want to. I read world war @CAPS1 books, and a wide selectionof others and if they take those away just for being offensive id have nothing to read. If i find a book i think is offinsive I just put it back and dont get it.     I think they should age books like this book is for ages @NUM1, and especialy movies and magizines because kids dont need to read or see certain things, because books and movies sometimes refer to drugs or alcohole and murder. I dont think music is a big deal because music isnt very influincial but music videos are soometimes bad. Movies sometimes go to far though and i wouldnt want my kids watching them, so i wouldnt mind if they take thos off the shelves if they are offinsive.I dont think books should be taken off the shelf because parents should know what there kids are reading anyway.

"Offensive material shouldn't be taken off the shelves at all. Books are written on various of topics from love to sci-fi. Everyone is offended by something; if all of us could remove a book that we precieve as offensive then the human race wouldn't read anymore.     @PERSON1 had to demonstrate this in a similar aspect to congress concerning his music lyrics. @PERSON1 is the reason why there is an '@CAPS1' sticker on @CAPS2's that contain offensive lyrics. Books SHOULD @CAPS3 be censored at all. It hides the authors thoughts, idea, and meanings behind their writing.     I've read hundreds of books from @LOCATION2 to @LOCATION1. The aspect that a parent is worried about what their children might read implies parents need to step in. Having an one-on-one talk about the books context with their child could solve this uneasiness parents have about books.     Pre-@CAPS4 to @CAPS5 to @CAPS6 requires many stages of growing physically and menatally. Through those phases kids learn from various sources including negative ones. It's up to the parents to ensure that tomorrow's generation can depict what is truthful and what is false.     My grandmother shared a memory about when I was @LOCATION1 learning to read. I was reading out of a @CAPS7 magazine; yes the magazine is intended for adults but I obtained the skill to read from it. A skill that will propell me into job oppertunities and assist me in everyday life..Keep falling..Do you like what you hear, what you see   And would you be, good for me too?.Janie always said I was a mess   I'm sorry 'bout that mess   I made her bleed   I'm planting my seed   Still I knew it could take it if I opened up the rhythm   I knew it could make it   I hope her parents love her      So, feelin' the acid on the brain   Still I got that frame I made   Her bleed yes she wants that lovin' you see   Well if you live you want to give or get old   And if you never knew that we get old, you live it up, live it up   You get old, believe me when I say      It's the same shit everyday   But I got to know my place   And if you don't it fucks you in your face   I know her parents love her   I hope her parents love her   I hope her parents love her so      Billyed back in 1983, what did you do for me   I made her bleed   I'm planting my seed   I knew we could make it   But I only knew that the bitch would break it   I hope her parents love her   So my God look at me   If he had to go I know   I know I'm barely lovin' my holy creed   You never knew that was what you need   Oh my God honestly believe it or not its a disease..There's one thing we're sure of,   We're mutants and we just don't care...

"Throughout the years, many events have taken place in our history. Throughout these times the events have been recorded, journaled, and filmed. These thoughts, opinions, and facts @MONTH1 be offensive to a select few in our @CAPS2. The question is, 'Should our libraries take these 'offensive' pieces off the shelves?' The simple answer to this highly disputed question is no. Censoring our libraries would be a harmful and wrong thing to do to the general public.      Censoring our libraries creates an illusion of a perfect @CAPS2. If libraries were filled with tasteless articles and perfect fairyland books the library would become a place where reality is not present. Libraries hold information that is raw and true without leaving the facts behind. People need to get a taste of reality in order to survive in the 'real @CAPS2' and one of the greatest ways to abtain this knowledge is through books. Being exposed to offensive material and different viewpoints helps shape ourselves into who we are or will become. To take this away would be harming our development and growth, thus creating an 'imperfect' @CAPS2.      Certain points in history are not something that everyone can be proud of. The @CAPS1, @LOCATION1's genocide, and @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4 are all devastating points in time that can be a touchy subject to one and few people. However, history is an important factor in everyones lives; we know history in order to not repeat it. Losing this information is way for people to not be clearly informed, harming the future outcome of our society. Without public records of these happenings, it can cause confusion and misconcepted views of important topics. If we censor all the media from libraries across the nation, ordinary people, such as yourself, would be 'living in the dark.'     As people develop their own opinions and views overtime they begin to distinguish the difference between right and wrong. Your rights @MONTH1 be someone else's wrongs. What @MONTH1 be offensive to you, @MONTH1 not be offensive to the person sitting next to you. Quoted by the author Katherine Paterson, '...if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf...you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' In truth, by removing offensive material from our bookshelves there would be no media left. Not everyone will have the same opinion on matters that hold importance, but that is why the @CAPS2 goes around. We as a society have the right to guard our ability to share opinions, censorship destroys our ability to do so.      Everyone is different. The @CAPS2 is full of diversity and viewpoints that are bursting with interesting concepts. By censoring records of history, opinion, observations, our @CAPS2 becomes an illusion. We need to have these facts available to the general public. By ridding ourselves of 'offensive' media we cannot share our opinions with one another for a more successful @CAPS2. Censorship should not be allowed in libraries because it is harmul to our growth as a society and is overall the wrong thing to do.I need some reassurance   You never know what you might find in the night..they all cry....My ashes within your hands..Do you wanna know why I'm here tonight   Well I'll tell you      (Beatboxing)   Rapping: Everyone knows me as a superstar, but this is how I lived my

shoulder   I need your love to warm me through and through   But I always get a cold shoulder from you      All the time I wait around to get a little squeeze   But nothing ever happens 'cause she

it's strange the way I hold it down   Know I know (I know you want it)   And I know (I know you know)   I got what you need   Saw you drivin by just the other day      I was riding in my car and my

wasn't me but it was heaven sent   I saw confusion in their eyes   Said I'm living right no compromise   I don't talk I don't dress like I did before      And if you give me just a minute I will tell you more   I am not the same, God has changed the game   Found that it's okay, I don't have to live that way   I am not the same, God has changed the game   You know it's okay, you don't have to live that way.I leave bleeding yet another day..No, don't go   I'll show you what it's like to be loved!"
"In my opinion, I do believe we should not have overly offensive materials on the shelves. These materials @MONTH1 not be offensive to some people, but it can be to others. They can be against some peoples religion and way of life.     I have read some books outside of my school library that I think should not be found on a library shelf. Now they are putting those same books in libraries. These books have violence and inappropriate behavior in them. Are these books you want your children to be reading?      There are even movies that are like those books. Many shows are based of a book series, and that series @MONTH1 not be a good one. The series can contain violence that can influence kids and teenagers. The kids could see something they think is really neat on the @CAPS1 and then go out and try that. They do not understand that what they do @MONTH1 not be a good thing. They could get into a lot more trouble then they want to get in.     I know there are some materials on the shelves that many people say are offensive and really are not offensive at all. In my opinion, the worst ones should be put away and only adults should be able to get them. After that, the adults can choose whether or not their children should watch them.     There are some that would agree with my opinion and some that would not. What do you think? Do you want your children watching or reading something bad that could influence the rest of their lives in a bad way? Would you want them to grow up believing that what they see in movies and read in books is all good?

"Yes i believe that certain materials such as book's, music, movie's, magazines, etc should be removed off of the shelves at a library if they are offensive in any way. Librarian's shouldnt have bad stuff on the shelves at libraries if it is offensive to some people. Libraries should only have interesting books with good story's to read and kid books. There should be no sexual or racial book's, movies, magazines, etc.     Those thing's that are found offensive should be taken off the shelf because there are little kids that go to the library and they should'nt be able to see those thing's or check them out. I do agree that library's should have a wide range of different kind of book's, and movies, etc because everybody has there own taste in what they like. But the thing's that are offensive should'nt be on the shelve's.     If library's didnt have offensive thing's on the shelf then nobody would have to see them or have arguments about them. It would be so much easier because it would'nt cause any problems with people because they would'nt be on the shelf. So if they would just take those thing's off the shelf then nobody would see them and there would be no problem's at the libraries. Adults and kids could go to the library and pick out what they wanted without seeing the offensive thing's on the shelves which would make it a much better place to enjoy..Still the rain kept pourin',

thinking about you   You never go on till I do   And I can't stop thinking about your love      Oh yeah      Can't believe I could think that she would just follow me everywhere I go   I was wrestling

"Should offensive material be censored?     Removing things such as books, music, movies, magazines, ect., that are found offensive could be both good and bad. It could be good because younger children wouldn't be exposed to things that are considered offensive. Although, it could be bad because it takes away from freedom of choice. Most young children don't know good from bad, so censoring these things for them could be good. Though, you shouldn't want to shelter your children from the real world. Protecting your children from things that offend you, @MONTH1 stop them from growing up badly. Censoring such stuff now doesn't really change what is already out there.     Censoring or removing things that you find offensive @MONTH1 be a good idea. There are plenty of reasons someone @MONTH1 want to do this. A parent @MONTH1 not want their child to read, hear, or see something simply because it offends them. Another reason parents @MONTH1 want to censor these things is just because they don't want their child exposed to it. Parents know that most young children don't know right from wrong, so they'd like to make that choice for them. By doing this, a parent knows what their child is reading, hearing, or seeing. Some parents @MONTH1 feel that they need to protect their children from these things because it could be harmful to them. They also @MONTH1 feel this should be done so their child doesn't grow up badly.     Removing offensive material from shelves would take away from a person's freemdom of choice. Who wants to be told what they can and cannot read? If a parent does this to their child, it just sheltering them from the world around them. A child should be able to know the life around them before they grow up and are completely lost. Parents @MONTH1 think that this is good idea because it protects their children from things that @MONTH1 be considered bad. When really, protecting them could be harmful. Censoring books, movies, music, ect., won't stop what is already bought and out in our world. Offensive music, movies, books, ect., have already been bought and sold for years.     I feel that censoring or removing books, music, movies, magazines, ect., should not be done. It doesn't give people a choice. Some people @MONTH1 like reading graphic novels or things like that. Music is made for the enjoyment of the people. Some people like their music to talk about drugs or curse, why take that away from them? It just wouldn't be fair to take a choice away from someone. A movie is just a movie, it's not real. Just because something is done in a movie doesn't mean that a person will go off and do it. I think people should be able to have a choice.     Censoring such stuff now doesn't really change what is already out there. If people stopped to think about it, they would realize that offensive material has already been bought by others. Plenty of people have illegaly downloaded, or bought music that uses inapropriate language. This music is already in their iPods, @NUM1's, and burned onto @CAPS1, there's no removing it. Books that some @MONTH1 find offensive have already been printed and sold to others. One person @MONTH1 lend that book to another, therefore the offensive book is being spread around. Plenty of movies that involve adult content, violence, and drugs have been released into the media. Lots of people own these kinds of movies. So, why censor things now, when there's already unremovable offensive material out?.Get up, stand up, stand up for your right (3 times)   Get up, stand up, don't give up the fight      Preacher man

" I think all books and other stuff should stay on the shelfs. Because other people should have the right to learn about something if you have already learned it.  Censorship is kind of out of the way.  I think it really doesnt matter if they see it now or later because they are still going to see it and learn about it later on in life. If someone wants to read it I think they have right to because it is their own choice.  I have been observing students and adults in the libaries and every where they think they can run everything.  But this is what I think is right.One way or another..Baby, take off your coat...(real slow)   Baby, take off your shoes...(here, I'll take your shoes)   Baby, take off your dress   Yes, yes, yes      You can leave your hat on   You can leave your hat on   You can leave your hat on   Go on over there and turn on the light...no, all the lights      Now come back here and stand on this chair...that's right   Raise your arms up in to the air...shake 'em   You give me a reason to live   You give me a reason to live   You give me a reason to live      Suspicious minds are talking   Trying to tear us apart   They say that my love is wrong      They don't know what love is   They don't know what love is   They don't know what love is   They don't know what love is   I know what love is.That girl is gonna miss you,   You gonna wish that you were dead..I'm touching your face and I   Can't get very far   You travel a million miles   Always in the stars   And crossing the clouds   A fading moon   Whispered ""It's goodbye""   But as it starts to die      Stay awhile   Show your love   Child among the stars   Just stay awhile   Lay with me   Tell me who you are      I've never believed in much   What can I be worth ?.Why don't we, why don't we,   Open our eyes?.I just wouldn't be living at all....When you open it to speak,   Are you smart?.Hey, just whose life is this anyway   You tell me how to live but who asked you anyway   Hey, just whose life is this anyway?.I look into the mirror   Can almost count the years   The memories are clearer   Of all those things I feared      I watch the time pass slowly   It comes and goes like the waves   The sea can touch the sky at night   It's got the freedom I crave      I'm going through changes in my life   I'm going through changes   It'll be alright      Look into a picture   A thousand years are told   Now is it any wonder   What our tomorrows hold      Our yesterdays are over   You know they go so fast   If I could rule the winds of change   You know I'd make it all last      I'm going through changes in my life   I'm going through changes   It'll be alright   Alright      I walked alone through the blackest night   I felt the cold, I felt the bite   I took the high road but it ain't right   It's just the low road in disguise      I'm going through changes   Ah yea   Everything's gonna be alright, yea      Got to the top of an uphill climb   Only to look down the other side   Just when you think it's on your side   This world will show you ain't no reason to the rhyme      I'm going through changes   Ah yea   Everything's gonna be alright      Times keep a changing every day   Watch out now cause it's heading your way   Ah yea   Seems like the world turned upside down   Seems like everything's falling down   But it's all getting better every day   Watch out now cause a good times heading our way   Ah, every day   Every day   Every day   Every day   Every day   Every day.Amazing grace how sweet the sound   That saved a wretch like me   I once was lost but now I'm found   Was blind but now I see      'Twas grace that taught my heart to fear   And grace my fears relieved   How precious did that grace appear   The hour I first believed      When we've been there ten thousand years   Bright shining as the sun   We've no less days to sing God's praise   Than when we'd first begun.(Everybody wants a lover like that) Everybody, everybody   (Everybody wants a lover like that)   (Is that what you are trying to tell me?).A shield of gold, the Creator and king,   And the great sword of steel..If you want   Dance!.It's unjust   I agree   Feed me a taste of you   Before I retreat      Are you eager infatually   Do your bruises speak evidence   Of all you won't be   I'll match all your hostility   Set the tone daily   But no boundaries decrease   And then I said, ""I agree""   Are those tears meant for me?.Daylight over the mountains, daylight on the Village Green,   Daylight over the field and the factories..In the lazy water meadow I lay me down..Women sleep, who knows what   Happened to be my wish..Beautiful things   Like leaves on a tree   Beautiful things   The sky and the sea   Since you've been gone   No beautiful things   Seem beautiful to me      Is there someone I can talk to?.Ada..Do the chairs in your parlor seem empty and bare?.I don't like this feeling,   I don't like it at all..Is it the science of Love?"
"Do I think certain materials like books, music, movies, and magazines that might be offensive should be taken off the shelves in libraries? Of course not, there supprisingly still is such a thing called freedom of speech in this country. Just because some people @MONTH1 find something offensive does not mean that the so called offensive material does not have the right to be published or shared with anybody.     Think of some authors that wrote books like @PERSON1, although there were alot of racist remarks in literature of that time period. That does not mean that they still are not a part of american history. What would taking these types of books off the shelves accomplish? Absoulutely nothing is what, racist people arent going to go hey since all these racist books are gone im just going to except everyone now.     Music and movies are forms of expression aswell, and if someone wants to get out of hand write something offensive so be it. You do not have to listen the songs or watch these movies. Nobody can force you to do anything of that nature.     People just take everything so literally these days, they got to have their part in anything and everything. When they should reallize that most problems like these do not even pertain to them at all.

"Opinion      I don't think they should be removed because in books tell you what it is about in the back. Movies tell you what it is rated. It is mom's or dad's fault. They are the one how allow us to read it, watch it, listen to it, or even play it. if they don't want us learn it then they should't even get for us and the reason they get it for us is because kids are spollied. they want every little thing in the world and the parants are buying it for them to make them happy.     The parants are not the only ones to blame. The kids are to blame to. They are the ones how want to go the rated @CAPS1 movies or get a rated @CAPS2 video games that have offensive language. kids also say offensive language to each other and suspect them to know what it means. The kids that heard the bad word will go to there parants and say 'what those that word mean'. It happen to me and I said those words to my parants.     When I fist read, heard, and watched it and told my parants what it means I got hit for saying that word. I thought to my self that they want to hear that from me. I was mad that i ever said that word I wished I can go back in time and never say that to my parants that. I don't know why I kept on saying it over and over. i just couldn't get it out of my head. I got in trouble by saying it just because I heard that stupid word that i wished never heard.       I heard it so many times I couldn't get out of my head it is like they knew what it ment but I knew they didn't know because they just said it randomly and I was preaty sure they didn't tell there parants because the one how told there parants got hit still woundering what it ment still having the red mark in there face thinking what they did wrong to deserve it. when I found out what it ment i never said it for a long time till someone got me so mad i started to say it again.     Now the two opinions still stands how should we blame the parants or the kids, should we take down the stuff that is offensive to us so the kids will learn the bad words? The choose is yours not mine beacuse it was mine i would blame the kids and no we shouldn't take it down stuff that has offensive language because for a lot of us we don't find it offensive to us or others.

"Have you ever felt that books are offensive? Maybe, but @CAPS2 all depends on who you are and @CAPS1 angers you. Somepeople think that books, music, movies, and etc. can be offensive in some way. I know they can, but @CAPS2 can only effect an amount of people if they together understand the problem. I think there are several ways why and why not to take books out of our libraries.     From @CAPS1 I hear, people do go angry over things but the question is '@CAPS1 gets them so angry?' @CAPS2 is different for somepeople than others. For example, a @ORGANIZATION1 fan reads a book about them and the author makes fun of them or teases them. That is a way to make someone offended and angry at a book. others can get mad at a movie because @CAPS2 discriminates races of other kinds. Like how in the @NUM1's, some movies characterized @CAPS3 @CAPS4 as stubborn, ignorant, human beings. In my view, actually being @CAPS3 @CAPS6 myself, sort of aggrivates me too, but none the less, shouldnt argue because of one major amendment, freedom of speech.     @CAPS2 depends on how @CAPS2 angers them also, like how back in world war @NUM2, the @CAPS7 people were characterized as short, fat people with big noses taking all the money away from the @CAPS8. That can be offensive, and is used usually to talk people over to their side. I think that if something offends you lightly, most of the time you shouldnt worry about @CAPS2, but if you get offended very heavily and none of the stuff they say about that topic is true, maybe you should get someone else to read @CAPS2 with the same dislikes and likes as you. That could help determine if @CAPS2 is truly offrnsive to people in general, not just you.      Then after that the main question we would ask would be '@CAPS1 should we do next?' If I were someone and the book I'm reading offends me massively, I would contact the library @CAPS2 came from and ask them to read @CAPS2, and if they think @CAPS2 is offensive, then they would more than likely take @CAPS2 off the shelfs. Now just because of someone that likes a sports team reads a book about them and the book talks trash about the team, dont tell the library, thats just a waste of time. Just simply pick up another book and read @CAPS2. I can understand how people will get mad over racism and disrimination, but not over a sports team.     So I hope that people can someday understand the limit to were something can actually be offending. Or maybe its just in our common nature for us to be offended when something we like gets made fun of. That is why I think that books should only be taken off shelfs for only very good reasons, not silly one.It's given me enough happiness, so true..[G.F.:]   I'm the guy in the sky   Flying high

"Dear Newspaper @CAPS1,      I believe that the country should take off all the books, movies, magazines, and music that has any kind of offensive cover, or any offensive mind grabbing, sexal contact in any of the  story, music, etc. Children don't need to be seeing that stuff just sitten around, the radio for example, the music that they put on like rap, hip-hop with all the cusin and singing about mony, cars, girls, and sex. Kids don't need to be hearing that stuff on the radio, and adalt books that are sitten around in @ORGANIZATION1 ready to be read by adalts, not children.The children need to know about all the sexual conflict some day just not when there @NUM1 or @NUM2 years old looking at pornograghic magazines, and movies. So I hope you keep this in mind get that stuff off the streets and not into childrens hands..And now we've got the whole stadium in love!.Try that..And I bet that this is how life   Turns out when

in the jungle tonight   They got two by two don't hear me right      Band playing loudly baby   Gone are the days when the days gone   I said gone      When the monkeys are gone   Gone or dead this is what they said      Chorus   Lost Mary   Cries, cries, cries   Yeah she does, yeah baby, that is what she did   Lions sleeps, baby   The lamb surely dies (??).Kill!.And can he do to you the things that I do?.You've stolen my world from under me my cheating end deceving me   And now you've gone and set me free it's in my book of memories   Inside the book of pages black with photographs that take me back   I hide the dreams that used to be here in my book of memories   The photograph that shows a bride and a man with joy he could not hide   And one of a boy on his daddy's knee it's in my book of memories   Inside the book of pages black....I gotta find peace of mind....Did I cross the line?.(Send me no roses what I need most is you)   Oh without fail everyday since you went away   The doorbell rings you're sending roses again   In my room all petals fall but darling that's not all      I read your card then tears began to fall   Send me no roses please no more roses   Roses are red I know but through my tears they look blue   Send me no roses please no more roses   Your roses can't hold me what I need most is you      Send me no roses....- Tu m'aspetti   sull'uscio della scena   e alla tua villa andiam soli, soletti..There you sit   All by yo'self   Everybody's dancin'   They can't a-help themselves      The mood is much too strong   You can't a-hold out longer   So get up   Don't fight it   (You got to feel it, feel it)      You better get on up   And get that groove   You know what, baby?.Cause I knew that topless lady, she had something up her sleeve..Please take down the mistletoe   Cause I don't wanna think about that right now   Cause everything I want is miles away   In a snow covered little town   My momma's in the kitchen, worrying about me   Season's greetings, hope you're well   Well I'm doing alright   If you were wondering   Lately I can never tell      I know this shouldn't be a lonely time   But there were Christmases when you were mine      I've been doing fine without you, really   Up until the nights got cold   And everybody's here, except you, baby   Seems like everyone's got someone to hold      But for me it's just a lonely time   Cause there were Christmases when you were mine      Merry Christmas everybody   That'll have to be something I just say this year   I'll bet you got your mom another sweater   And were your cousins late again   When you were putting up the lights this year   Did you notice one less pair of hands      I know this shouldn't be a lonely time   But there were Christmases when I didn't wonder how you are tonight   Cause there were Christmases when you were mine      You were mine.[Chorus:]   Do you want to be in love forever   Do you want to make my dream come true   Let me be the one to kiss and hold you   Say you'll be my baby   Can you see the two of us together   Living in love this whole life through   Do you want to be in love forever   Say you'll be mine      I can remember   When my mind was clear and free   Now there's a feeling   Coming over me   The sweetest attraction   That my heart has ever seen   I'm going crazy making sense of anything      (repeat chorus twice)      I really wonder   Is there magic in your smile   Taking me under   Got me acting like a child   Something about you   Hits me like avalanche   I try to stand my ground   But I don't stand a chance      (repeat chorus)      Every time I close my eyes I dream about   Hugging you, holding you, kissing you boy   It's driving me crazy   But even if it takes forever   To win your heart and your love and your devotion   I know it's gonna be worth the wait      Ooh, say you'll be my baby   Ooh, be my baby   Ooh, oh darlin', say you'll be mine      (repeat chorus)      Do you want to, do you, do you want to   Do you want to be in love   Do you want to, do you, do you want to   Say you'll be my baby   Do you want to, do you, do you want to   Do you want to be in love   Do you want to, do you, do you want to   Say you'll be mine      (repeat chorus).The plates began to shift,   Perfect lefts come rolling in,   I was alone and far away, hey,   When I heard the band start playing,   On the lip, late take off..Doin' business, dressed in gray   Try to make it, payday to payda   Doin' business, here to stay      I'm tired of the program   Tired, tired of playing the game   Television, radio   Tell me, where did the dreams go?.Jeremy: Candace party!"
"Katherine Paterson once said, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf- that work I abhor- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' I disagree with Katherine Paterson's statement because there is a @CAPS1 to @CAPS2 and the @CAPS1 to Write. The author obviously had a purpose to write the novel, compose the music, or to deliver the movie. There will always be items that will be offensive to some people, but to others there is a meaning behind it.     The @CAPS1 of @CAPS5 gives everyone the right to speak what is on their mind. That @CAPS1 allows them to publish whatever they have to say in a novel, a piece of music, or in a movie. Sure there @MONTH1 be some parts that @MONTH1 be inappropriate somewhere in a novel, piece of music, or a movie, but that doesn't mean the whole item will be inappropriate. Some people might think some things can be offensive while others don't at all. There maybe somethings out there in this world that you @MONTH1 think are offensive, but have you stood up and told that company yourself?      Being able to put down anything on paper that you want everyone to know about is the @CAPS1 to write. With that you can't be told not to do so. For example, the '@CAPS6' magazine maybe offensive to an abundent number of parents who don't want their kids to look at it, but that magazine isn't intended for children to look at. That magazine's purpose is to show adults what is all out there to buy to make their appearance sexy. It's not to be offensive to anyone and that company has the @CAPS1 of write to publish such a thing. The @CAPS1 to write serves its own purpose to all of the writers, composers, directors, and anyone who wants to write in a journal or to write a note.      I bet there has been a novel, a piece of music, or a movie that you just love. Well within it there most likely was a piece of information that was inappropriate, but would you like to see that taken off of the shelf? For example, I once read a series when I was in middle school that had inappropriate content about sexual interaction, but that series is what every girl wanted to read. If they would have taken them off the shelf because they were not appropriate then I know plenty more novels that would be gone as well.         What would you say if there was nothing left on the shelves to read, listen to, or to watch? Without items such as books we could have a hard time learning new stuff all the time. These are the items that teach us new things everyday. Would you be able to enjoy your life without being able to read, watching movies or @CAPS7 shows, or listening to music? It would be a very hard thing to get used to in today's society. We rely on such things @NUM1 to get us through the day and teach us things we were never taught.     Disagreeing with the quote that Katherine Paterson stated is one way to use @CAPS1 of @CAPS5 by stating my view of removing inappropriate items off of shelves. Removing items of the shelves won't solve the proplem of having too much inappropriate usage in today's society. If everything that had some kind of inapporpriate content in it removed from shelves, we would have a hard time finding a novel to read, music to listen to, a magazine to enjoy, and a movie or @CAPS7 show to watch. Lots of schools rely of books to read and without a book childrens vocabulary could have a great downfall.  Think about it...what would you be able to do in your free time if we had no more books, movies, magazines, or music.Place your dead king deep inside and that's the end..Right now   I am an

"Books, magazines, movies, music, etc, are all good to read, watch or listen to.      When I listen to music or watch movies or even read books sometimes. I wonder how do people come up with these ideas.The real reason is why people listen to music, read books watch movies are so offensive. In todays world you got music with all this negative stuff about people, talkin about people, with the curse words its not a good look for the people who make the music or the people who listen to the music. I feel that that stuff not be allowed in the shelves and it should be removed. Parents dont want there little children hearing that negative music. When they grow up they are going to be like them because everybody sings there songs and everything else.     I feel movies should not be removed from the shelves. The reason i say is because movies are funny, scary, sad etc.Sometimes u need the offensive in a movie, with out that it would not be good most of the time. One of my favorite is @CAPS1 @CAPS2 and it was about character from the past @CAPS1 and @CAPS4 get back together and do one more mission. That movie was offensive but u still have a good time watchin it because its has the nice cars and good character. Movies should never get removed from the shelves cause out offensive of movies it would not be fun.People can not go to the movies with there friends and have a good time.If u are taking little kids out make sure u pick the right movies for them.To conclude argument Music is not bad thing to listen cause u have good music to but all im saying is make sure to watch what u listen to and get in trouble trying to do what they say in there music.To the movies keep comming out with good movies and keep making the movies good.Darling, the last time you lied, was it really the last time   Have all the tears that you cried simply dried up and gone   All in the world you can hurt anymore is my feelings   What ever love ever was, never lasted too long..Lets get this party started!.She gave me comfort   Made me smile   She was my best friend for a while..If I write your name a thousand times   Inside a heart next to mine   Act like a fool whose faith is blind   Whatever I do, I do it for your love..I don't care what you want to be, baby,   Long as you're happy and free..Yeah   Well, well, well   Yeah...

"Offensive @CAPS1     @CAPS1. Books, music, magazines, movies, commericals. Is it right to have all types of @CAPS1 shown to all ages? I disagree. A variety of people could take offense to the content this @CAPS1 contains. I think that there should be a designated area, or all the alarming @CAPS1 should be removed so everyone can be at peace when they are at the library, or just watching television in their own home.      Even though some people @MONTH1 not take offense to any type of @CAPS1, you have to think about the parents. A majority of parents would not want their children to be surrounded by all the effects that this @CAPS1 brings. Some content @MONTH1 not be suitable to younger kids. Whether it be going to the movies or just going to the library, children can see all the violence and misbehaving going on in the world today. I believe that drugs, alcohol, and curse words have a big influence on kids these days. I think it is our responsibilty to protect them until they are at an age they can make their own judgements.      Religion. Our religion plays a big part on what we think is right or wrong. I was taught to always treat people with respect and to try my hardest to get along with others. A lot of the @CAPS1 contradicts what I have been taught. If you see something on television with your favorite actor or actress on it, we tend to believe it is acceptable behavior. If you have ever been to a movie theater, you know they have certain ratings. The ratings are there to protect younger kids from getting into adult movies. They enforce this rule to an extent, but I don't think they enforce it enough. At the least, libraries and movie rental places could have a designated area for adult rated content to respect those who disagree.      A few years ago when my little sister was about two or three, she was watching a movie with me and it had a few curse words in it. She had never heard them that often and wasn't sure what they meant. For the next couple of days, she went around saying the word and my parents weren't very happy. She had no idea she was doing anything wrong because she heard it on a movie and if they could say it, then she could too. Children sometimes don't know any better and if they would happen to say it to a stranger, they would be offended.      @CAPS1 can be harmless, but it can also be offensive. The safest way to keep the new generation respectful, is to shield them when they are young so that they can learn what is right and what is wrong. When they come out into the real world, they won't be difficult to put up with and will have proper manners.

"Has anyone ever stopped and thought about the negative aspects of censoring a book? Many people of different beliefs take offense to books that show negativity to their ideas. When people are offended by a book the first idea that comes to mind is to try and get the book off the shelves by censoring it from libraries. I think that if a book offends a certain group of people they should just simply not read it.     Why should other people not get a chance to read a good book just because it offends someone else? Banning books would go against what our country stands for. How different would it make us if we started censoring books in our libraries like other countries with governments who have the final say on what can and can not be read?      Imagine what life would be like if all books found offensive were stripped from our shelves; there would be nothing left because anyone can find something offensive in any book. I understand that sometimes things written in books can really be disturbing ,and offensive but that doesnt give anyone the right to just take it off the shelves. Censoring books is a short term answer to a long term problem.     I believe that if we always resort to censoring books then we will become a less creative society. There are many people who @MONTH1 actually want to read a book but never get chance just because it is censored from library. Books that are censored are usually the books that help ones imagination. Would you want to live in a world where people are void of creativity?.The sun will shine on you again, a bell will ring inside your head - and all will be brand new..I ain't never fell for a girl like you (like you)..Some kind of funny looking money machine it is, Saddest looking people that I've ever seen..[Chorus:]   Singin' about l-u-v baby, luv   Singin' about l-u-v baby, luv      Throw up, throw down   Get yourself a better town   All these towns look the same   Self pity, number one recreation   We're dying in the USA..Marching to the sound of drums   Look at the guitar he strums   He's the man with the golden gums   Hmm hmm hmm hmm hmm hmm he hums      Chorus:   Just to hear the words you speak   Just to feel your body heat   Just to see what's underneath this week   So take a look at this boy   Stand back, enjoy   Take a look at his ploy   He's cool, he's coy   They go higher, higher   'Til they set themselves on fire   They go higher, higher   'Til they set the neighbourhood on fire      In baggy underpants and vest   He makes a move toward his guest   Round and round and up the spire   Loving like a tumble dryer   Just to see him undressed   Put his manhood to the test   I suppose I could have guessed      Repeat chorus.Holly holy eyes   Dream of only me   Where I am, what I am   What I believe in   Holly holy   Holly holy dream   Wanting only you   And she comes   And I run just like the wind will   Holly holy      (Sing) Sing a song   (Sing) Sing a song of songs   (Sing) Sing it out   Sing it strong (Sing, sing, sing, sing)   Yeah   Yeah      Call the sun in the dead of the night   And the sun's gonna rise in the sky   Touch a man who can't walk upright   And that lame man, he's gonna fly   And I fly   And I fly      Holly holy love   Take the lonely child   And the seed   Let it be filled with tomorrow   Holly holy      (Sing) Sing a song (Sing)   (Sing) Sing a song of songs (Sing)   (Sing) Sing it out (Sing)   Sing it strong (Sing, sing, sing, sing)   Yeah   Yeah      Call the sun in the dead of the night   And the sun's gonna rise in the sky   Touch a man who can't walk upright   And that lame man, he's gonna fly   And I fly, yeah   And I fly      Holly holy dream   Dream of only you   Holly holy sun   Holly holy rain   Holly holy love.It's you, no one else will do   I knew one day   Another true love would come my way   Only time will tell   If it's right, it just can't fail   And there you were   And my quest for love is over   Now my only lover...is you      No one else will do   It's true   I'm the only one for you      Love ain't so bad   If you have an understanding   You know it's everlasting   You let it show with the test of time   I'll be yours and you'll be mine   Without a doubt   Now my quest for love is over   Now my only lover      It's you....i'll never love another   Nobody can take your place   Without a doubt   My quest for love is over   My only lover   It's you.this example is called my home town..And I fill the bedroom   With silent visions of rain..To you it is just a job   To the people it hurts to the bone..(This I swear...)

"I think they souldnt be pulled off the shelves because everyone has different opions . one person @MONTH1 think a book is offensive but the next @MONTH1 not. Some people @MONTH1 think any books with god or jesus in the are offensive but that @MONTH1 just be because it is not there religion. If every person took off a book that they thought was offensive  there would be no books left. Because people think differently. Or some @MONTH1 not like the @PERSON1 books because of the violence and goryness but to some people those are there favorite books, so that would be unfair to the ones who like the books that others dont.

"Censorship in libraries? Is it a problem? Should we fix this 'problem' or is it for the good? People of different culture, background, and life could be profound by these articles in readings. Can these books be offensive? They could be offensive to some but to others only educational. Statements have been made all over the world of people speaking on what they believe is right or wrong. How many people believe that censorship in libraries is really offensive and should be removed from libraries?     Who really are the victims when books and magazines are being thrown off the shelves? The author of that specific article that's who. If it is said that every reading that comes off offensive should be taken off the shelves, then what would be left on them. Some people @MONTH1 take romances being offensive or comedy or horror. Romance could be hurtful to someone only because they maybe just got out of an relationship, or comedy because they are miserable and don't know how to laugh anymore or know what happiness is. Who knows? Opinions such as these would be only terrible for business but also terrible for the educational and history part of life itself.           People of different races and cultures @MONTH1 have another opinion on the situation of censorship. From all over the world there are cultures spreading throughout. Born into a religion could be a huge affect on what their outcome is on a book, magazine, or a movie. Movies of past experiences or massacres that happened to a cultrue @MONTH1 be difficult for some people of that culture to take in. The normal response to a movie such as that would be to become angry or frustrated. Only for others it is an oppertunity to learn what those people went through and grieve for the loss of the people during that time. To support the people who made it through those heart breaking times and become a friend to them and learn more about them, their culture, and way of life.      Have you seen protests arouse before you? Anywhere in the world? On television, hear it on the radio, or see it in the newspaper. Everyone has most likely seen this type of protest or attack on the opinion of another person. There have been protest in the past of the freedoms of a person or even race. If everyone begins to complain and argue of what is being put on shelves in libraries. What will come of our world? What will we know about the past? What will we begin to predict for the future? Anyone, and even I can make observations of the acts going on around us. In my experience, I have seen of attacks being struck upon people who only put a picture in the newspaper, or a small article spoke out on television. Who are we to say that everything needs to be removed off the shelves in libraries? These are just people who have been hurt and don't want to relive that experience.      Overall, my opinion on if censorship in libraries should be extinguished. I believe the answer is no, every person in the world is going to be upset, hurt, or broken about something at least a million times in their life time from now on. Whether it be in books, music, movies, magazines, or anything else. They just need to understand that without any one person's culture that there would be no history of life before us.And if that horse and cart fall down,   Well you'll still be the sweetest little

"In my way of viewing things i say that what i think is that the book, movies, music, and magazines should be put in critical order because some of us want or like to read or see stuff about what we want to see like the news that are in one way good to us, but some others like to see what's behind from the reality and want to speak up but they can because they are afraid that they would get hurt for speaking up. So i think that those things(books, music, movies, magazines) should not be removed from the shelfs because those books or movies can bring you what's going on in the world and how is affecting us in the way of not paying attention to it. Some experiences that i have is music i had once heard a song in spanish called '@CAPS1 The @CAPS2' and it talks about the corruption in @LOCATION1 and that how the people from the bottom suffer because of the people from the top do not care about them, also if you treat them as kings they will treat you as a slaves, and that if you give them the @CAPS2 to control you, they will take out advantage of it, how the honest people work hard to bring food to their homes, but its not enough because of the leaders on top that want all for them... its a very good song that says the true about it and that nobody does something to finished.So i don't want that songs or books that show the reality disapper because some people doesn't like them at all.(On a nigga)   Thass' why you don't love these hoes   Thass' why you don't love these hoes   Thass' why you don't love these hoes   Thass' why you don't love these hoes      She got a nigga in here, dumb hot (dumb hot)   Tell a bitch, hurry up its in that green dot   Left a nigga in the dirt, now she like 7-Eleven giving free slurps   I bought a celly from my cellmate, she dont even text a nigga no kind of sex- play   Fuck that bitch, I'mma have the lil home girls rush that bitch      I say my bail too high, my hopes too low   My case too slow, violation from my P.O   I just got out I shoulda just stayed on the couch, 3-way now my ho tryna cuss me out   And my lawyer say the witness coming to trial,   On top of that I heard my main bitch fuckin' around   Im bangin' and shit, my lady prolly sellin' her clit, no money on my books   A nigga taking L'S wit this bitch!.Gonna shout it, from the roof..And how many babies did you kick today?.Moonshine time   Thoughts of you   Spinning round   As thoughts do      I just wondered if   Your eyes still shine   As they did   When you were mine      I can see   In a dream   Thoughts so clear   And jewels that gleam      Would your eyes   Still sparkle then   If we were, once again      Jewel eyed Judy please come home   Jewel eyed Judy don't leave me alone   Jewel eyed Judy please come home   Jewel eyed Judy don't leave me alone      Lovely Judy   Can you see   Where it is   You're meant to be      Where you lay   Your head tonight   May the stars   Find your light      So am I   Sitting here   Moonlight glistens   On my tears      Is this all   That we could find   Chains of memories   Left behind      Jewel eyed Judy please come home   Jewel eyed Judy don't leave me alone   Jewel eyed Judy please come home   Jewel eyed Judy don't leave me alone.If I could only win your love   I'd make the most of everything   I'd proudly wear your wedding ring   My heart would never stray when you're away      If I could only win your love   I'd give my all to make it live   You'll never know how much I give   If I could only win your love      Oh how can I ever say   How I crave your love when your gone away   Oh how can I ever show   How I burn inside when you hold me tight      If I could only win your love   I'd give my all to make it live   You'll never know how much I give   If I could only win your love      Oh how can I ever say   How I crave your love when your gone away   Oh how can I ever show   How I burn inside when you hold me tight      If I could only win your love   I'd give my all to make it live   You'll never know how much I give   If I could only win your love.Ask anyone you meet and they'll say the same   Noone is quite sure of his name      The real ripper   He went to school today   The real ripper   Took all the books away   Keep your hand on your heart but he's gonna get you   He's gonna make you toe the line.Disciple!.Not the smell of mercy on me!.Do our best to break the ground..Empty is me..Think it was September, the year I went away,   For there were many things I didn't know..I'm a burglar in the first degree   But it don't seem to worry me   I'll be so tired, so tired   I'll be so tired, so tired      So tired.(An exercise in self-indulgence)   Music by Geddy Lee, Alex Lifeson, and Neil Peart      Instrumental      I.

"Hiding @CAPS1?                                                  By: @PERSON1 to the harsh world we all live in, I do not believe it is morally correct for a program, of any kind, to hide the hard reality of our world from any person.      @CAPS1 will be @CAPS1 and one shouldn't ever hide what is true from the eyes of another person's mind. If one person makes the choice to close his eyes and go into a fantasy world then that is one person's right as a human being. However, one man has no right- whats so ever- to close the eyes of another person for them.     Personally, I myself am not afraid to look into the history of man's choices and take upon myself the burden of the harsh knowledge that I have inherited. I look at the human race of this planet to be whole and to be one with another. This planet doesn't belong to one race, nation or culture of people; it belongs to every single person equally. I made the decision to take on the resonsibility to know the past and use it's lessons to better the future. This world belongs to me as equally as it belongs to you; so my decisions will affect you as much as they affect me. That being stated, every person's decisions impact everyone, not just one's self.     People think that we should hide things that are 'offensive' to other people. Racism, world political issues, casualties of war and personal ethics- are some of these 'offensive' things. However, offensive or not, these subjects are very real and very much alive in our world; So why should anyone have the right to try to make these subjects dissappear for another person?      In @LOCATION1, everyone has the right to freedom of speech and expression, but how can these freedoms be carried through if people remove these expressed ideas and beliefs from the shelves of the readers? We all have a right to make the decisions that affect our world and if this world is equally owned by everyone, then everyone's decisions are equally burdened by everyone. That being said, we all have the right to know the decisions, actions, and the concequencies of these decisions and actions that our people all create every single day.     In conclusion, I believe that our world is harsh and also beautiful. Being that of which it is, I believe it is every man's right to live and decide the way he wants to. No man should ever make another person's decisions for them. Everyone is resonsible for their own life and how their life affects other people. However, no one has responsibility to hide or change the world around us from any person, for it is the knowledge of the people that make the world what it is and it is the knowledge of the world that influences a person's decisions.Turning and returning to   Some secert place inside watching   In slow motion as you turn around   And say      [Chours: Both]   Take my breath away   Take my breath

"Dear @CAPS1,     @CAPS2 I have found that there has been a strong censorship in the libraries and I would like to express my strong disagreement for these actions. I have found that things have been removed from your shelves due to its content. Some of the content is vulgar and explicit and some is very offensive, but that still does not give you the right to remove these things. Books, movies, music, and magazines are very big parts of peoples lives and removing these things can be a big part of someones development.      First off you should not be taking books off of shelves for any means. There is a reason these books have been written and published nad it is because they have some meaning and can teach people or give them information on things they would not know otherwise. Taking books off shelves is pretty much just sheltering people, mostly kids, from information that would benefit them no matter in what way. Yes some books talk about sex, and yes some books have offensive terms but unless children are exposed to things like this they will not know that it is wrong. If they do not read books about how slaves were treated, they will never know about the slaves. If they never read a book about a married woman having an affair, they won't understand the significance of cheating. When people read these things they learn about them, and with a little common sense they can understand these things are wrong. Books should not be taken off the shelves in a @CAPS1 at any rate and movies should be looked at in the same manner.     Movies now a days have come along way. Flicks like @CAPS3 and @CAPS4 use such a high form of technology that people would have no idea how it was done just a few decades ago. Some movies due contain very vulgar language and offensive terms and sometimes even nudity, and I can relate to not wanting a little child to see that. This does not mean that these things should be removed from the @CAPS1 though. In all honesty I do not want my little brother or sister walking past a @CAPS5 container with a picture of a girl in lingerie on the front and I do not think anyone else is ok with that. Other movies should be put on display for kids to rent though. Movies that can teach them history although there is very graphic content. Movies that will help them learn how not to do somethings like kill or rape. Movies that can show these things but also teach how incredibly horrible these things are at the same time. I think that the movies that go past this should be put into an adult only section and I do not think any pornography should be put on display anywhere, but movies need to be available to a very high extent. Movies are very good teaching tools and magazines follow that same path.      In the world today we have magazines like @ORGANIZATION1 that are jam packed with information that can better kids from a young age to even people who have been out of school for a while. I feel like some educational magazines @MONTH1 be graphic and show things that children should not see but on the other hand, seeing it will help them understand. Now I am not saying I want to put @CAPS6 magazines on display for people to see and learn about how little of clothes some girls can wear but magazines that @MONTH1 show the very little amount of clothes people are forced to wear in countries in @LOCATION1. They should be able to view magazines that could show, a little more on the nude side, of people who are starving because they only can eat twice a week. Things like this although can be very offensive maybe to some people should be viewed because it can teach. It will show kids that these people need help and they can be those people that help them. Once again pornography should not be available at anytime but other magazines that have an educational aproach but could contain some naughty things due to the teaching should be able to be heard. Magazines should be available but on the other hand you have to take a more careful approach to music.      Music is probably the hardest to figure out, of these censored things I have spoken of today. People use music to express feelings. Whether those feelings are good or bad they get them out through song. Music is something that brings people together and allows them to be unique at the same time. Music should not be taken away from people going into a @CAPS1 because of its vulgar content or anything of that matter. There is a thing called the 'clean' version of pretty much any song that has curse words in it. Songs that cannot be cleaned up or are not available in that way I can undertstns why they are taken off the sheleves but other than that I think everything should be made available. Music can be so powerful to people and taking it away is not the right thing to do.     In conclusion the censorship should not be done. Yes there are somethings that have to be removed due to the extremeness contained in it but if things can be learned from I feel like it should stay no matter what. People go to a @CAPS1 to learn and there are so many tools that can be used to teach them. Music, movies, magazines, and books can be such a big part of peoples lives and taking these things from them is not right.I want you to want me..They said the answer   Was to become a dancer,   Hold

" i fell that this test is stupid i hate reading and writing. i think that you all should only make sure that we can read on level and write on level bc alot of kids arn't even going to really try on this test till like their @NUM1 or @NUM2 grade year and also alot of teachers dont even teach this material till the end of the year           so i think that some of the stuff that u all test on should be changed like the stuff you test on and how long the test is and should be more focest on reading and writing levels     however i do agree that the test should still be here because it helps felter people who passed the class by cheating and who passed it by hard work     i think there should be an alternative test that is taken on paper to because some kids test better on paper then on a computer     this is the way i feel about the test. i know i was supose to write about offensive material but i couldnt think how i felt about it and this is the stuff that was on my mid so i thought i would enform u think you very much.There's somethin about the herb, so fast, hypnotize..I capricci tuoi...

"What other people take as offensive might be taken to others as something they value. I believe that all sorts of books, music, and magazines should stay on the shelves at the library. People value many different things and we need to give others an opportunity to explore what else there is.                                                Different types of books explain different types of things. Some people connect with books in a way that others @MONTH1 not understand. Taking certain types of books away can risk other peoples feelings. Taking music, in my opinion, would be the worst because people get lost in some types of music. They use music to escape their probems and taking that away can leave them helpless. People love movies. It helps people understand what is going on in other peoples point of views. Taking away movies could leave people with no entertainment. People like different movies and some movies can be offensive. But, it's not up to anybody else. Magazines help people keep up with news. Most of the news can be very offensive. It is the people around you causing the offensive news. Taking away magazines can be keeping people from the latest gossip and news.                                          Taking away things that people use to connect with, what they use to escape with, their entertainment, and the news would most likely cause peoepl to act out in a bad way. Everybody is defferent and everybody likes different things and taking away something that others think is offensive is unfair to the people that think it isn't. What if somebody thought what you liked was inappropriate? How would you feel?.(are..Whenever I feel afraid   I hold my head erect   And whistle a happy tune   So no one will suspect   I'm afraid      While shivering in my shoes   I strike a careless pose   And whistle a happy tune   And no one ever knows   I'm afraid      The result of this deception   Is very strange to tell   For when I fool the people   I fear I fool myself as well!.Have you been in love lately?.I'm alive, I'm alive, I'm alive, yeah!.He rode in town on a white horse   With nothing in his hands   He came to gather his people   And take them to his promised land      When he came he knew there would be bloodshed   But still no violence made his places   He came to fight in a battle   With no guns or money   But with his empty hands      With his empty hands      They said hey boy what you lookin' at   As they eyed his dreaded mane   He said my father has sent me   I've come back to reclaim      The children whose hearts   Were so whole and pure   Now it's you who'll die in pain   So they lynched the man      Who fooled the word   And all the children gathered   In his empty hands   In his empty hands.What is love?.Would you be free from your burden of sin?.On a government scheme   Designed to kill your dream   Oh mum, oh dad   Once poor, always poor   La la la la la   Interesting drug   The one that you took   Tell the truth - it really helped you   An interesting drug   The one that you took   God, it really really helped you   You wonder why we're only half-ashamed?.For your precious love means more to me   Than any love could ever be   For when I wanted you I was so lonely and so blue   For that's what love will do      Darling, I'm so surprised,   Oh, when I first realized   That you were fooling me   Darling, they say that our love won't grow      I just want to tell them that they don't know   For as long as you, long as you are loving me   Our love will grow wider, deeper than any sea   And all the things in the world, in this whole wide world   Is just that you would say that you'd be my girl      (Wanting you) Wanting you, (I'm lonely and blue) whoa, lonely   That's what love will do      For your precious love means more to me   Than any love could ever be   For when I, I wanted you I was so lonely and so blue   That's what love will do.I'm Alabamy bound   They'll be no heebie-jeebies hangin' 'round   Just gave the meanest ticket man on earth   All I'm worth to put my tootsies in an upper berth      Just hear the choo-choo sound   I know that soon we're gonna cover ground   And then I'll holler so the world will know   Here I go, I'm Alabamy bound      I'm Alabamy bound   They'll be no heebie-jeebies hanging 'round   Just gave the meanest ticket man on earth   All I'm worth to put my tootsies in an upper berth      Just hear the choo-choo sound   I know that soon we're gonna cover the ground   And then I'll holler so the world will know, here I go   I'm Alabamy, I'm Alabamy bound, I'm gone.Jai guru deva   Jai guru deva   Jai guru deva om.And I'll butt-fuck you!.No matter how your heart is grieving   If you just keep believing   The dream that you wish will come true.Here's that rhythm again..I was so lonely..We were caught in a bubble, no one could burst..Hey!.For Now does ride in on the curl of the wave,   And you will dance with me in the sunlit pools..This what we're supposed to do, here's where we're supposed to be   I hated MTV for trying to play me like a mockery   But that don't bother me, I just fulfill my fucking contract   Small price to pay just to take a piece of my back   My back, backfire, assassination of my character   Just demassing me in the America   My younger sister, Erika, just adopted a child   My older brother served fifteen, he made it out   Even though my father loved me, I ain't seen him for a while   Had to fight my baby, bitch, give me my nigga now   Cause I'm running out of time and I need him to understand   The way a superior man had build a brand   Niggas talk about my taxes, had to pay, I consemn   I'm surviving cause the lines ass crooked in the hand      Heartbreak, disappointment, my mother died when I was nine   I just wanted to join her   Now I miss to join her, get to California   I got something for you to do, it was like I was annoying   Resurrected, found my purpose, I remember being dragged   Being nervous when I would kick my verses   I was virtually worthless, my whole life was a circus   I was sleeping with serpents and I thought it is worth it   Got a call from Paul, told me shit isn't working   Exchange words, told me tell me that shit in person   He probably told him, and by the way did he said it   On a prolijetic twisted made about him   I see Slim and he said he didn't recognize me   Was it that or did he let another man to find me?.(What, what?!).Said that I wanna be,   your lover gurl..You'll go to your grave a sad and lonely man,   The door is now closed on your   Pathetic little plan."
"Do people take offensive books serious. There are lots of stuff in book that people @MONTH1 think is offensive. Some other people @MONTH1 think differently. I pretty sure libraries have censored shelves, but if not people shouldn't get so worried about it and here are ways.     I feel that certain materials that young people see in books, music, and movies are at the library. They see stuff that's around them. they also see what there mentor and parents are doing/watching too. The author of the quote (Katherine Paterson) can't just blame it all on the library.     In the paragraph I wrote before this I said that children see things that there metor and parents are doing. Now today in the @NUM1 century parents really don't keep a good eye things and what they leave out for what they child can get. Kids like to play with stuff they first see. If parents don't want there child seeing offensive material and other stuff on the shelves in a library then they should watch what they kids are doing more carefully and watch over their backs.     I really don't care that the shelves in libraries are offensive. I just don't pay any attention to it anyway. We are living in a better world that it was years ago. If people still are getting mad over petty stuff like that, then what are they still here for. When young children get older they are going to end up seeing things that they coudn't see that's still going to be on the shelves in a library.     We shoudn't take books offensive. After all they are just words on a piece of paper. I believe that offensive materials and other stuff should stay on the shelves of library. Besides some people need to know the truth sometimes in order to understand stuff more clearly..But I ain't got nobody   To bury me when I'm dead and gone..Do you know what it feels like to be the last one to know the lock on the door has changed?.I don't want to spend another lonely night...

"Censorship, @CAPS1 or @CAPS2?          I can understand why libraries would decide to keep certain books off their shelves. Libraries are a place for learning and work. If you were sitting near someone at a public library who was reading smut you could feel awkward.      Although some people @MONTH1 find certain items unoffensive, other @MONTH1 disagree. Imagine you are a mother with a young child who decided to wonder through the library. Your child finds a magazine. It's '@CAPS3'. Not something that you are going to want to explain to your child. If the library were to have not kept the magazine, it never would have happened. Libraries are a public place that should be taken seriously.    If people really want to find something that is inappropriate they can find it somewhere else. The modern world today makes it easy for people to find just about anything without a large hassle. Therefore it should be fine to keep certain materials out of our libraries.      How can people take libraries seriously if there are dirty books, or books with rude language, and scandalous themes. If you are trying to get work done or learn and there are distracting items on the shelves then it @MONTH1 make things more difficult.

"Dear Newspaper,      I would like to start off by saying yes, books, magizines, music, movies, etc., are great for the kids in the library.  I think thats the best thing for them to do when they dont have anything to do, go to the library and read or work on stuff in the library and I think that some things should be in the library because we are in high school and we need to learn some things here but some of the things we learn are not very appropriate.      In high school just walking down the hall ways your going to learn alot of things you probably dont need to know yet but when you walk into  a library they dont need to encourage it by putting  books of drugs, alcohol, and sex on the shelves.       Books about drugs are alright to an extent.  If your reading about medicanes you can take and being in the doctors office and getting percriptions is alright but when you got books about pot, weed, crank, or meth thats a little much.  We need to learn about those drugs and what they could do to us if we use them or abuse them but we dont need to know how to roll a blunt or make meth.      Books about alcohol are the same way.  We need to know the dangers of drinking but we dont need to know about teen parties and things to do when your drunk.       Advertisements, magizines, etc., are the worst things for us kids because everyone of them have something to do with drugs, alcohol, or sex and trying to get us to do those thing in high school. The front cover of magizines always have people who have got caught with drugs who is dating or sleeping around with who and ik that we will and need to know these things but i dont think we need to read them out of books because then we read it and see how other people did it and we feel the need to do it or try it.     I believe these books that are over the line about alcohol, drugs, and sex need to be taking out of the librarys so that the kids have something to learn about and ask there parents about.  I have been in the librarys and I know for a fact that the first books I go for have one of those three invloved in it because those are interesting and we like reading about stories at parties or someone getting pregnant or an @ORGANIZATION1 but also when I read I think about it and I think I want to go to a party they made them sound fun.     This is what I think about some of those books on the selves and what I think should happen.

"Books can always be amazing things in how they take us to whole new worlds and how they enlighten us to new ideas we @MONTH1 have never thought about before.  However, are some books just too much to handle and should not be read?  Well think what you @MONTH1, but I believe all reading and media materials should stay on their shelves in libraries because people should have a right to know what is in the real world, even some of the bad parts.  Different assortments of media should definately not leave libraries or be banned from them because people need to be educated in all that exists, they need to know even the bad things in this world so they can hopefully be educated enough about it they can go away from evil acts and help fight against them, and first and foremost it is their right to choose what they want to read because each individual must have the option to be who they want to be.  Though we can only hope that by giving people such knowledge they can rise up and do what is right.     Even education @DATE1 is being influenced by people saying that students can not be taught certain realms of knowledge, but in the long run does this really help people?  If people were educated enough to know about everything we know and what they themselves as an individual choose to learn, wouldn't that help them from becoming curious and learning lies from an invalid source, instead of the array of resources they would have open to them at a library?  Each individual should have the right to learn what they want to learn and should not be closed off from any resources, otherwise they @MONTH1 never learn the real truth behind a topic, which would work against the whole point of learning.  These seekers of knowledge should always be able to seek as they please, so that they @MONTH1 learn and hopefully make new advancements for everyones benefit, but they can only hope to this with proper education.         Another point to look at is that people need this variety of education, so they can work for causes important to them.  With knowledge people can make new innovations and create and spread new ideas to help make the world better.  Although  this can only happen when they know both sides of the story, so that if they oppose something they can know what they are talking about and what they are pushing against and what cause they are pushing for.  The only way people can truly make their ideas heard will be when they can understand all about their topics.  Without certain points of information that could be taken out, people @MONTH1 have no backbone to what they are saying and then they would even hamper other people's learning processes as well.     Also another reason to not have censorship is that we all have rights in @LOCATION1,and hopefully globaly someday, to be who we want to be in the pursuit of happiness as long as we do not hinder anyone else's dreams in our own pursuit.  People really just need to be who they really are in order to help the world and make differences, because if we were not allowed to be our own individuals then people would never advance.  Without this advancement, people would have just remained the same in their cultures and beliefs, but instead people chose to seek knowledge, and in doing so gave us the technology people have @DATE1.  Harry @CAPS1 even argues in his popular books series that we must know the enemy to fight them.  Would he have become such a hit if others didn not believe this as well?  To change this would go against the rights people have found for themselves, thus meaning if we gave these rights away, people would have regressed.       People should always be allowed to access all types of media, especially in librairies.  These media types help shape who each individual is and helps them to help make contributions to the world in their lives.  Though there wil;l always be bad media, we must understand even the bad in this world, so that hopefully people will make the choice to combat it.  We all certainly would not be the people we are @DATE1 without all the influences on us and by taking away even parts of knowledge we would end up only dehabilatating ourselves.   These choices all help us to hopefully advance and continue forward into the depths of understanding, so that knowledge will continue on forever.Something I wanna say   Yeah, you know I'll be there

seventeen   I spent all my college money   On a half a dozen strings   I thought my folks would kill me   I found out I was wrong   They said your future's written on your face   When you sing those travelin' songs   So we headed for Kentucky   With a suitcase full of dreams   My rough-out books, a few T-shirts   A worn out pair of jeans, ooh   This old guitar and me   We spent a lot of nights alone   Well, sometimes we'd get lucky   And take bar maid home   One night stands for breakfast   Two strangers with the blues   We'd wake up in the morning   And both feel a little used   Well, home was just a highway   We'd roam from town to town   Just me and that old flattop   Not caring where we're bound   From Maine to California   With a five piece travelin' band   Singin' songs about the hard times   That face the common man, ooh   This old guitar and me   Lord, we did the best we could   One was born a sinner   And one a piece of wood   God sent a wooden angel   To guide me on my way   We were meant to be together   Until my dyin' day   Well, now my dearest old companion   Lies underneath my bed   Well, our travelin' days are over   Man, but the memories fill my head   Well, I've settled with my family   Here in the hills of Tennessee   To teach my children's children   'Bout this old guitar and me, ooh.I woke up this morning   With an attitude   Looked at the headlines   Put me in a real bad mood   Sitting here remember   Tryin' to stay sane   Between the end of the summer   And the comin' of the blessed rains   And I feel dirty   All the way down   I feel dirty, baby   Like this dirty town   I gave you everything   On a silver tray   Could have been a fool forever   But I'm not made that way      And after all these years   I think it's time to say goodbye   I'm doing you a favor   I will not help you live a lie   And believe me,   If you think I'm gonna catch you when you fall   You don't know me   You don't know me at all      I closed up the curtains   Learned to confess   Baby I knew better   But you were such a pretty mess   You took my breath away   And now I want it back   Aah, you should have killed me   Cause you always looked so good in black      And after all these twisted roads   That we've been down together   I think it's time to say goodbye   And believe me,   If you think I'm gonna get down and crawl   You don't know me   You don't know me at all      Oooooo      After all these years   I think it's time to say goodbye   I'm doing us a favor, baby   You know I cannot live a lie   And when you need me,   And you think I'm gonna

"I believe that if some people don't like a certain book or movie then they should be able to tell the library about that itme and it should be removed from the library. The library should allow people who use the library to take away things that are offensive to its customers.     Some parents who come into a library with their children let their children go off and look at books by themselves which is what my @CAPS1 used to let me do when I was a kid. If children are by themselves with no adult supervision and wander into an adult reading section they could look at something bad. They could also buy a magazine that looks perfectly fine on the outside but have offensive images on the inside.      When I was ten years old, my family and I went on vacation to @LOCATION1. We were watching a baseball game that was on commercial break one night. We were fliping through the channels wating for the game to come on. We were all watching the television when an offensive image came on the televison that children's eyes shoudn't see. That occurance happened when I nor my parents wanted me to see it. That image was an adult image and was meant for adults only, but childrens eyes can see it as well. Libraries should think of this when they are puting books and magazines on their shelves. They might be making a little bit of money but they are effecting a childs life in a negative way. Things like this could happen in a library also because children who are young won't always know what is a childs book and what is an adult magazine. Children also might ask their parents for music that the case of the music might look fine on the outside, but have cursing and bad things on the inside. This is the reason why all items in a library that are offensive to people should be removed from libraries.     If people who go to the library don't like something on the shelves they should be able to ask the library to take the item off the shelve. The libray might not do it everytime, but taking items off the shelves would make libraries more enjoyable and safe for children. If the library doesn't take the items off the shelve it could effect their business in a negative way. The library should only take off the items that regular visitors to the library ask for. The library shoudn't listen to someone who has visited the library only a few times. The library should listen to its customers that visit the library often.      I think that all offensive images to people that visit the library should be taken off the shelves and removed from the library. The library should listen to its customers not only because it could effect their business, but becasue it could effect the lives of children in a positive or negative way..Where do we go from here?.Taking what I may   He can start to say his prayers!.[Repeats].When people used to talk about the country that's what they used to mean..You may say I'm a miracle mannequin,   There I go with my mystical plan again,   Although you think I can, I'm just a man   I don't walk on water, (oh no)x4      My dromedary dreams   As wet as oceans   With sand dunes bearing seeds   She set in motion   My dromedary dreams x4 (fading out).You whispered, hurry..?.Lay me down at your altar, baby   I'm a slave to this luck   Your electric lips have got me speaking in tales      I have prayed for a power like you   To see deep down in my soul   Oh, you make me bloom like a flower at desert road      Magic, or one, or mystery   All of you trying to work on me   I would surrender myself   Holy hell, and heaven high   You will open up my eyes   And I'm finally here      This is spiritual, under your spell   Phenomenon, the way you make me feel   Like an angel, oh, at blow   Like a feather, you make me float      Love you crazy kite on your left   Lost in sweet ecstasy   Found a nirvana finally      Magic, or one, or mystery   All of you trying to work on me   I would surrender myself   Holy hell, and heaven high   You will open up my eyes   And I am finally here      This is spiritual, under your spell   Phenomenon, the way you make me feel   Like an angel, oh, at blow   Like a feather, you make me float      (You make me float, you make me float)      This is spiritual, under your spell   So phenomenon, the way you make me feel   Like an angel, oh, at blow   Like a feather, you make me float      (You make me float, oh, you make me float).You made my decision   Now take hold of my hand   And I'll promise in front of the world   To be your one true man      I'll stand among my best friends   They all understand   That I'm changing for the better (yes I am)   I'm your one true man      I am your one true man   Your one true man I am   I'm gonna love you like no one man can   Your one true man, I am      Living wit me isn't easy   My life has its demands   But I want you to know that wherever I go   I'm your one true man      I am your one true man   You one true man I am      Sometimes I get so crazy   You get so hard to hold on to   But I won't let you go   'Cause I know, I know who I am      I am your one true man   Your one true man I am   I'm gonna love you like no one man can   Your one true man I am.Rise up and repeat after me: ""I'm beautiful!"".Yeah, we could dance across the sky,   Leave the world behind us..I've got strength of the soul..[Chorus]   Tha Chevy standin' so tall, I'm lookin' down on y'all   That's all I gotta tell you niggas, I do this shit!.As the sound bounds in the street   And you settle down to your back seat   And the movement seems to be   [Incomprehensible]   And all the jokes that you use to poke   At all the dopes you were once seen with   And every word that you had   I was looking up to you for a reason   And you joke at all the words that you spoke   And you say, ?Hey man, I was only teasing?.Oh my son, I am weak and I'm trembling,   For the lord I am always remembering..Ooh baby, ooh baby..[Chorus]   We are eternal   We are immortal   We are the flame that never dies!.Down where your paint is cracking   Look down your backstairs buddy   Somebodies living there and   He don't really feel the weather   And he don't share your pleasures   No, he don't share your pleasures   Did you see his eyes?.(I'm comin')   I'm comin' out (comin') I wan the world to know, I got to let it show..Once upon a time   Somewhere in the back of my mind   I fell in love with you   But then   Everything went wrong   I couldn't even write a song   There was nothing to look forward to   I don't go out very much   I'm always home on my own   Baby, I was just too blind to see   I wanted to conquer the world   But the world had a mind of its own   Maybe I tried a little too hard   Maybe I pushed you away too far   Got a room in your heart for a lonely heart   Got a room in your heart for two   It might be nice   Living in a heart with you   So sing and all the world will shine   Somewhere in this nursery rhyme   A happy ending lies   For all the lovers with the lonely eyes   Easy come, easy go   This is just to let you know   Baby, I apologize   How could I turn away love?.Sir et la peur      Tu t'entends lui dire des phrases sans aucun sens   Qu'importe les mots n'ont plus d'importance      Car le ballet a commenc?.."

"There are a lot of issues concerning offensive material that are used for entertainment purposes. Sometimes these things should not be on the shelves. Such as movies, books, magazines, etc., they can be seriously offenseive to other people that are different races or different religions.     Censorship can be used to solve this problem, like in the book @CAPS1 @NUM1, it was used to keep books out of the picture completely. To keep the society from becoming offended, or for that matter, thinking. However in this matter it is the complete opposite, having all kinds of negative material and not caring what it can do to other people, or @MONTH1 damage other people.     However this can also be argued. The people that are offended by the material, wether religious or race, really don't have to be around the material in the first place. For example if the material is in a library, then the people don't need to go to the library.           In conclusion people don't have to be near the offensive stuff if they are offended, but people should not be so cruel also..The illusion of power, it's already set signed and sealed,   The illusion of power..You go to my head   With a smile   That makes   My temperature rise   Like a summer   With a thousand July's   You intoxicate my soul   With your eyes      Though I'm certain   That this heart of mine   Hasn't a ghost   If a chance   In this crazy romance   You go to my head   You go to my head.Playin' games inside my head   That nobody else can see..I guess that's your concern   We live and learn..At Christmas Eve, tomorrow's near   I hope that love will bring you here, home for a while   I'll make the best of what's for me   But I would love you here to be holding me now      How I wish that you and I and love could be close   'Cause the holidays are when I need you most, so   Another year, another chance   A different song, a different dance   For us to try      Please come home for Christmas (I don't want it this way)   Please come home for Christmas (and stay)      Good morning love, it's me again   As Christmas day begins again, I think of you   I know that time has passed us by   I tell myself to stop but I still dream it's true      How I dream that you and I and love could be one   'Cause Christmas time should never be lonesome   Remember when our love began   You held my heart, I held you hand   Ready to fly      Please come home for Christmas (I don't want it this way)   Please come home for Christmas (and stay).When I see my life flashing before me sometimes in these songs..Shackle their minds when they're bent on the cross   When ignorance reigns, life is lost   Shackle their minds when they're left on the cross   When ignorance reigns, life is lost   Shackled our minds when we're bent on the cross   When ignorance reigns, life is lost   Shackled our minds when we're left on the cross   When ignorance reigns, life is lost, lost, lost!.Why do we do the things we shouldn't do?...

"Library Censorship     Libraries shouldn't have 'offensive' books removed from shelves. Parent supervision, librarian supervision, and your own common sense are three of the reasons why books shouldn't be removed from shelves if they are considered to be offensive.     Parent supervision is one of the top priorities for knowing what your children read. If they don't want their children to grow up being 'stupid' then they should teach them to focus on educational books more. When they see their child in a row of books that they think is inappropriate, then they should remove their child from that area and take them to another area.     The librarian's supervision is also an important priority. Maybe they don't know the children's actual age, but if the librarian sees them in a place that they think is inappropriate for someone around their age, show them another book shelf. Just like parents, librarians will try to find an educational book that the child @MONTH1 enjoy. But, librarians obviously like to read since they are around books all day, so the child @MONTH1 be lucky and the librarian finds an adventure book for the child, or something else that the child finds interesting.     The person's common sense is also a reason why 'offensive' books shouldn't be removed from libraries. Most people know how old they are and what kind of books they should read. If they are in an area of the library that other people @MONTH1 think is inappropriate for them to read, go to a different area.     Once again, I don't think there should be a censorship in libraries. If parents want their children to read books that won't 'rot your brain' then they should observe what books their child reads, trust the librarian to show them the correct books to read, and expect their child to have good common sense.And you like the rock 'n' roller   A different life and whiskey Cola   But don't be low keep your own style   And catch your train!.Why do I have this

"You are the mother or father of a young child, and you take them to the library. While there, you see some advertising for a new book. The sign is all bright and flashy, so you stop to read it. It turns out to be advertising a book and some movies that you believe should not even be available here, for they are far to inappropriate and offensive. What would you do?      Personally, I believe that if you see something like that, that you believe is offensive, you should say something. Talk to the librarian and state your case about what is going on. Having offensive articles in a public library where kids of all ages go to do their homework, is just plain wrong.      What if that certain library had no restrictions on who checked out what? So many kids could check things like that out, and not even know what it actually is! Could you imagine your child coming home from the library, and handing you a book, magazine, or movie that was way beyond anything they should ever see at that age? It would be disasterous! I @MONTH1 not have children, but I do have younger cousins. I know for a fact that if they brought home something inapproproate or offensive, their parents would be having a major talk with the librarian.     Libraries should have major restrictions on what gets checked out by who. For example, my library has three different kinds of library cards. One card is just to check out regular books. Another is so you can check out movies, music, and books. Then the third and final card is so you can check out books, music, and movies from the adult section in a small room at the back of the library. However, to even be eligible for the third card, you have to be eighteen or older.      I strongly believe that if a library does carry materials some @MONTH1 find offensive, they need to be kept in a small room at the back of the library, or behind the librarians desk. This way, noone who does not want to see the materials doesn't have to. If someone did want to see or check out these materials, they should need proof that they are eighteen or older. This would make it easier for the librarian to keep track of who looks at or checks out the materials.     Another thing, what if someone finds something offensive that someone else doesn't? Well, I honestly think that at least two or three people should comment on it being inappropriate or offensive, before it is actually taken off the shelf. If more than one person does say something, the librarian should place the book, magazine, movie, music, ect., in with the other offensive materials, where there is an age restriction.      This is how it is at my neighboorhood library, and I strongly believe that this library is a model for all libraries wanting to have more restrictions. If all libraries had more restrictions, it would be better off for everyone. Parents would not have to worry about their young children wandering around and finding something that is totally wrong for them. Older teenagers and young adults would be able to get their homework or projects accomplished without having all the distractions of the offensive materials.      In conclusion, I hope you take all that I have said to heart. I hope you write an article talking about the restrictions in libraries, and how they would make everything better off. Thank you for taking the time to read this.Imagine me still lovin' you   After all you've put me through   Well, I can't help it, I just do   Imagine that, and that's not the half      Imagine this, if you can   I've stood more, more than I should stand   But I'd still take you back again   Imagine that, ain't that a laugh      Can you believe I'd swallow my pride   Well, yes, yes, I guess you can   'Cause you know you've always had my foolish heart   Right in the palm of your hand      So, for what it's worth to you   It just don't matter what you might do   'Cause I'm still waitin' and lovin' you   Imagine that, ain't that a laugh      (Repeat last verse).Every day lend me your own special way   Melt my heart away with a smile   Take time to tell me you really care   And we'll share tomorrow together..Cloud nine, you can be what you wanna be   (cloud nine) you ain't got no responsibility,   And ev'ry man, ev'ry man is free   (cloud nine) and you're a million miles from reality..(She's tight.).And if you wanna get real   And if you wanna get honest   Then baby you know the deal   What you wanna do?.God loves you for being you..Hammer!.How ya doin', all right?.Anywhere,   Oh, yeah   Send for me...I'll be there!.Kim   Please tell me you're not married   You don't know, you can't know what I've done to be here      Ellen   You don't know how he needed a new start      Kim   I feel walls in my heart   Closing in   I can't breathe   I can't win      Ellen   As for the child   You say it's Chris's      Kim   Oh yes, Madame   My son is Chris's   I had a dream for my son to belong   And not live his life in the streets like a rat      Ellen   We aren't rich, but we'll shoulder our load   Chris and I are totally together on that      Kim   Then you must take Tam with you      Ellen   Take a child from his mother, impossible Kim      Kim   You will take Tam with you   Then he'll get what I wanted for him      Ellen   But Kim, your child needs you   Chris is married to me, we want kids of our own      Kim   Tam's chance lies with you now, not with me      Both   No!.It's raining rain from the skies   It's raining tears from my eyes over you   Raining, oh, tears from my eyes over you      Raining, oh, raining on prom night   Oh, raining, oh, tears from my eyes over you   Raining.(You better have a happy landing)      You know that you better (have a happy landing)   You know that you better (have a happy landing)   So come on and have (have a happy landing)   Don't you know that I ought to....I'm a wild-erbeast..To keep me sane in this burning oven..The sound of breaking   glass echoes around the cave..[Excited Southerner]:   Well I...I can't...believe...I'm in the...laser disc...Mr.Gibson...I...I   ...I...such a...got to...I...Braveheart was...you...you're...got your   Autograph...with a 8X10 gloss...your face was burnt though...Tina   Turner...singing a song to the...mama...mother...mother...loves you too...got   To...Bird On the Water...not such a good picture but...you made up for it with   The Mad Max...got a...mail...mail was very...got so much going...and the koala   Bears...got...I'm a big fan...Golden Globe awards...if maybe the people's   Choice...

" I believe that some materials in the libary should be taken off. Some people @MONTH1 find them offensive because they might have bad things in them. Some types of music have bad language in them and people dont want little kids finding them. If a little kid saw that stuff then they would learn bad things. And they would say it in front of everybody and then everybody would being saying it.     Alot of books are ok to read because they dont have bad things in them. some people like reading books that have drama and some people dont. Most books re ok to read. But some can have langauge in them and ahouldnt be aloud in the libary. But they can still be in there because some people might want to read them. If people dont want to read them then they shouldnt get them.     Some movies have bad stuff in there. That kind of stuff should not be in there because alot of people dont want to watch movies like that. And if a kid would walk in there and get one and if it had that stuff and the parent fount out then the libary could get sewed for having that stuff. So they should be taken out of the libary so people wont get them. The libary can keep children movies in there to watch because they are not bad.     If i worked at a libary then i would take magazines out. Sports magazines would be ok to keep in there. But alot of the others ones should not be there because they have alot of bad things in there and i wouldnt let people take them so i wouldnt have them in there. But sports and stuff would be ok because sports are not bad for people to read. People like reading about sports because it is interesting to read.     That is just what i thank. Other people might see it the other way and they can. People are different and they will thank different things. Some people might want to read that and some people dont. So it just shows you that people are different because they thank things different then other people do. And some libaries have that stuff and some dont. sp if you are one of those people that like that stuff then go to one of them that have that stuff. And if you are one of those people that dont then go to one that dont have that stuff so you can get what you want and they can get what they want.neva' seem to amaze me..It was all worthwhile, each moment we knew..But in the end you see,   You took the best of me..We're gunna wake up hate   We're gunna fuck you up      I want to break everything   I want to make it safe   We're gunna wake up hate   We're gunna wake it up      You gotta get it straight   We're gunna give it up   We're gunna wake up hate   We're gunna fuck you up      I want to break everything   I want to make it safe   We're gunna wake up hate   We're gunna wake it up      I am the falling of my happiness   It is no more   Stop loving, I'm still hating   Till I can not hate no more      I've had to suffer   I cannot wait for more..You've got to pick-a-pocket or two, boys   You've got to pick-a-pocket or two..Whatcha say?.And i'll be (your grace your dignity)..There ain't no use in cryin'..That love would keep them warm..Slip inside my sleeping bag,   slip inside my sleeping bag..I believe in love, Alfie..Only a boy   Laughing aloud,   Quick as a shot,   Nobody can stop..The earth is shaking under siege   And every breath we'll meet is fate   Still we hunger for a moment of freedom   Even though the hour is late   I find hope and it gives me rest   I find hope in a beating chest   I find hope in what eyes don't see   I find hope in your hate for me   Have no fear when the waters rise   We can conquer this great divide   When every eye is one the fortune   It can only breed contempt   They say blood is thicker than oceans   Still we box our brothers in   I find hope and it gives me rest   I find hope in a beating chest   I find hope in what eyes don't see   I find hope in your hate for me   Have no fear when the waters rise   We can conquer this great divide   Whoa, ooo, ooo, ooo ooo   Whoa, ooo, ooo, ooo ooo   Whoa, ooo, ooo, ooo ooo   And we're gone   And we're gone   And we're, holding on   And we're, holding on   And we're, holding on   I find hope and it gives me rest   I find hope in a beating chest   I find hope in what eyes don't see   I find hope in your hate for me   Have no fear when the waters rise   We can conquer this great divide   Whoa, ooo, ooo, ooo ooo   Whoa, ooo, ooo, ooo ooo   Whoa, ooo, ooo, ooo ooo.It happened   I felt it happened   I was awake   I wasn't blind   I didn't think   I felt it happened   Now I believe in matter over mind..Scream my symphony   (screen my sin for me)?.Ride with the idol,   But it wont turn out the same..Write me a letter a face in the hall   Hiding from someone afraid of the fall   And she's waiting for someone to take her back to where she came from   And she'll wait alone for hours she won't mind because there's someone   In the story she remembers she remembers in the letter   And the tears locked up inside her make her heart break open wider   Shuts her eyes and takes the picture from the wall.Cause it ain't easy meeting someone new..And yesterday   There was nothing in my life worth living for..I drove so fast..Are you ready ?.Take me away take me away   You said that you were gonna stay   But you're always lying anyway   You're gonna suffer if you don't start breathing      Now   Now that I need you   You're going away   Everyday sinking in the quicksand   Follow me down the drain      But it doesn't matter anyway   You're gonna get yours any day   And why you put the blame on me   If you could only see yourself as others see you      Now that I need you   You're going insane   Everyday sinking in the quick sand   Follow me down the drain   Everyday drinking in the same bar   Drowning my sorrows away      Take me away take me away   Or I'm never gonna get away   But it makes no difference to me   It's just the sound of on more rock star bleeding      Now   Now that I need you   You're out of the frame   Day by day sinking in the quicksand   Follow me down the drain   Everyday drinking in the same bar   Make mine the same again"

"Killings, murders, and homosexual books can all be offensive to one person or another, but that doesn't mean they should be taken away. That is like saying I get offened by homework, take it out of @ORGANIZATION2. Some of the most interesting books to read are about murders, I think. I belive they shouldn't be taken out or else no teenage kids would read in @ORGANIZATION1. Teenages like to have mystery and romance. I know that one of my favorite books, The @CAPS1 @CAPS2, would offend some people because it has murder in it. That certainly doesn't mean it was not a good and interesting book for me. They can just over look these books and pick another.     If you want to keep your @ORGANIZATION2 @ORGANIZATION2 students interested you shouldn't take out book that might offend someone. By taking out some books not everyone would be happy. Some kids might not even read any more because you took the best books out of the library. Every book in one way or another would offend someone. They just need to overlook those books and read a diffrent one. I have seen some books at my @ORGANIZATION2 that offended me, but i did not tell the libraian to take it out of the @ORGANIZATION2. Another student might have loved to read that book.      Everyone has diffrent oppions so there would not be any books left if they took out all the offensive ones. The only books that would be left would be @PERSON1 the @CAPS3 and children books. I do not know of any @ORGANIZATION2 @ORGANIZATION2 student that would want to read @PERSON1 the @CAPS3 and give a speech about it in class. I'm not sure how the teachers could do book reports any more; all the books we read in class could offend someone. If everything that offened someone was taken out of the schoolt there would be nothing left of the @ORGANIZATION2. See everyone has a diffrent oppion on everything. That just isn't right.      In conclusion, books that offend someone shouldn't be taken out of schools and librarys. They keep the @ORGANIZATION2 students reading and growing. With out some of these books I myself wouln't like reading.

"Are offensive materials offensive to everybody? Does everyone think the same material is offensive? Who is to say what is or is not offensive? Offensive material can be anything someone wants to think of. Children are going to see this material anyways, weither we take it away of not. Offensive material, such as cursing or rage, is a form of expression and of releaving stress. Such things can also show anger, hate, and depression.      Children will see and hear offensive things anyways. Even as it is now, parents try to hid such things from their children. this makes them curious. They will do anything to understand it. Offensive things are part of everyday life. The more you hid it, the more children will seek it out.     In movies, books, and music, this is a form of expression. it releaves stress, rage, and shows this so that @CAPS1 is a true picture of what is going on. People cannot imagion someone truly angery in a book when it says, '... and she says with grief and anger, 'You are wrong! You don't know what you have done!'...' You cannot show foreshadowing, or show the anger. You cannot see how a character truly feels. For example, '... and she says with grief and anger, 'You are wrong! You will parish! You don't know what you have done! Death will come!'...' @CAPS1, you have an idea of how the author will play out the story and how the character really feels. You can see the foreshadowing. The author could be saying that a good man has died, who was going to stop evil, or an evil man died, and people will revenge him.     In such ways, this can show anger. Some people would find the example offensive or out of line. Cursing to me is not offensive. But, they show how the character, writer, or singer feels when it was written without it having to state it. Offensive material can also grief. This shows that someone is hurt by what has happened, amplifying the story. allowing the reader, watcher, or listener to expect more and want more. So the reader, watcher or listener would wait for more, and by the music, book, or movie. It puts intrest into the material.     Only certain people can agree on something offensive. Such as family, friends, or a group of close people. But, it applies foreshadowing, intrest, anger, grief, and sometimes, passion. Your children will see it if they truly want to. So, why get rid of something that they will see anyways? Something that intersts them and makes them want to read more, watch or make movies, or listen to or make music. Why would something that, yes, is offensive to some, but would grab promote and keep some within it.If you need us, just call..I got this graveyard woman, you know she keeps my kids   But my soulful mama, you know she keeps me hid   She's a junkyard angel and she always gives me the bread   Well, if I go down dyin', you know she's bound to put a blanket on my bed      Well, when the pipeline gets

away a little at a time   But he never could get drunk enough to get her off his mind   Until the night      He put that bottle to his head and pulled the trigger   And finally drank away her memory   Life is short, but this time it was bigger   Than the strength he had to get up off his knees   We found him with his face down in the pillow   With a note that said, 'I'll love her till I die.'.And I hear her voice a-hummin'   To me as in days of yore,   When she used to rock me fast asleep   Outside the cabin door..It happened to me, wonderful sight..Hey!.(Life is sad and so is love)      I love

" Ok some books can be really offensive and some magazines can be bad like this one sports magazine i read talked about some atheletes and their accidents. like one article was talking about @PERSON1 playing basket ball and he had the stomach flu and he was having a hard time playing cause he had to use the bathroom alot.'I mean who would want to let the world know that they used the bathroom on themselves'. thats bad! And another thing why do libraries have books that have sexual things in them. Theres quiet a few books that are like that for an example theirs this book called 'wake' and its about a girl who gets pulled into other peoples dreams like there was this girl who had a dream and it was sexual i thought wow why is this book in here. It also had alot of cursing in it i enjoyed it but i think it should be removed from the librarie. Cause theres kids that arent of age so they should'nt read them. i dont know thats all i have to say right now other then look at what your kids read theses days you might get upset.First time I saw you girl,   I knew that it wouldn't be long   I tried holding back my feelings   But you came on so strong   No one told me about her   But I know they all knew   That I know all about the girls   That do the things you do      Cause you're all talk, no action   You're all talk, no action      You're playing those games with me baby,   But one of us has got to win   Someday all the boys are gonna find out   That you won't even play it with them   You're running out of numbers baby   You won't say no, you just say maybe   One of these days you're gonna get   What's coming to you      Cause you're all talk, no action   All talk, no action   You're all talk, no action   You better stop this fooling around   You're all talk no action   You turn it up to cool me down, cool me down, cool me down      Sticks and stones will break my bones   But their names could never hurt me   Cause I ain't afraid of you running away   If you love me tonight then desert me      Cause you're all talk, and no action   You're all talk, but no action   You're all talk, but no action   You're all talk   You're all talk, no action   You're all talk, no action   All talk, no action   All talk, no action.Some people stay all alone and hide   They don't even want to know the reason why   They've given up on finding someone new   But new love comes, it's gonna come for you   When true love comes, it's gonna comfort you      Now you say you've got a broken heart   You oughta know this side of love can leave you torn apart   Dry your eyes 'cause your heart's gonna mend   And maybe tonight you'll fall in love again   Yeah, maybe tonight you'll fall in love again      But I know, I know that you're down on love   But you're wrong, so wrong   To be down on love      Now love seems so far away   Your skies are so cloudy   And the tears come like fallin' rain   Face up to it and don't pretend   And maybe tonight you'll fall in love again   Yeah, maybe tonight you'll fall in love again   Just once in a lifetime you'll realize   When love takes two, only one heart cries      But you're wrong, so wrong to be down on love   You know you're not the only one   See I've been down on love      In matters of the heart   You better know before you start   You can't get down on love      So always be prepared   To be alone and a little scared   But never down on love      You see you can't stay down forever, girl   Down on love   Come on, now   Don't get down on love   This ain't right baby, no   Down on love   Don't you go through life livin' down on love   Down on love   Don't you go through life livin' down on love   Down on love   Don't you go through life down on love   Down on love   Down on love.Oh grave, where is thy victory?.Did you think I'd take it sitting down   And let you walk all over me   Thought you knew me much better than that   I keep much better company      With your lawyers and your two timing friends   I guess you know who I mean   Your detectives and your private eyes   Could never win me back again      Just where did it get ya   What satisfaction was had   You kicked the shit right in my face   Is that all the thanks I get      You said we made such a pretty pair   Living in harmony   I'm sorry honey but I disagree   It seemed more like a comedy      Just look how you lied girl   That Judas right by your side   He hung you up so you cut me right down   Is that all the thanks I get      Guess I'll find me a brand new girl   That won't take too very long   There's so many floatin' 'round this town   Waitin' by the telephone   And if you want me I'll be in the bar   Back into my usual ways   Or on the corner with the rest of the boys   You and I were just a breath away   It was great while it lasted   But oh Lord it turned nasty   You didn't give me one chance to explain   Well is that all the thanks I get      Is that the thanks I get   Is that the thanks I get   Is that the thanks I get for loving you   Is that the thanks I get   Is that the thanks I get   Is that the thanks I get for loving you.Why?.His friend have flown away, he's left out in the cold..Home again I turned my collar to the wind started home again   Home again a place where I can find the friends that's home again   Well I've seen everything that I wanted to see   And I finally see what's important to me I'm going home I'm going home      Home again I've been too long upon my way this way don't pay   Home again too many names I can't recall it's coming home   Well I've done everything I thought I wanted to do   When each step I took took me far away from you I'm going home I'm going home      Home again I can't extend by even time joys ain't crime   Home again somehow I know there's time enough enough to love   Well I've had everything that I thought I would need   Now I'm going home I'm gonna try my hand of freedom   I'm going home I'm going home I'm going home.(Why you acting like that?).Yeah, baby you've changed   I'm lookin' through you   Yeah, I'm lookin' through you   You've changed, you've changed, you've changed.You've got to live for today, then let it go, oh   Lover, I want to spend this time with you..Softly the evening vespers   Hallow the closing day   Sweetly the Savior whispers   ""Come to the throne and pray."".[Chorus]..She asked me if I was a singer then called me has-been   She said she really like my band in the early 90's   I said stop saying those mean things, my ego is so fragile   And the she called me a poseur punk   Why don't I drink up and get the hell out   'Cause I'm a sellout      That berating kinda bumped me out so I left the prakside   I walked to my Volvo and noticed I had a couple slashed tires   But adding injury and insult to vandalism   Someone took a key to my door and boldly spelled out   You're a sellout      It says on the side of my car that I'm a sellout   I play a Korean guitar but I'm a sellout   I'm a sellout.I got a lot to do.'.When I walk along your city streets and look into your eyes,   When I see that simple sadness that upon your features lies..Here comes the rain, baby   Guess it's goodbye again, baby   For awhile it was fun, we could walk in the sun   But you never could stand the rain, could you, baby   See the rain in my eyes, baby   I never could stand goodbyes, baby   For awhile you were mine but the sun can't always shine   And you never could stand the rain could you, baby   For a while you were mine   But the sun can't always shine   And you never could stand the rain could you baby   I tried to keep the rain from falling   You know I tried to keep the rain from falling   It's not the rain in the skies   It's the rain in my eyes, that won't ever stop falling, baby.They say she had a heart attack   I think the preacher's coming back

"I don't believe that we should romove any books, music, movies, magazines, etc. from our libraries due to many reasons.  This is the real world and the things you read about or watch in a movie @MONTH1 be something you don't want your kids to read about or even see.  Life is about learnig new things. To learn about these ideas, you usually read about or see them somewhere.  The only way I would ever remove any of these items from a store is if they were going to seriously harm the people or have a negative effect on them.      If I were to walk into a public library and I saw a book about a girl cutting herself or someone killing another person, I would be the type of person to turn away from it; even thought it is what many kids are reading about today.  Of coarse, every library has books that cover all kinds of topics.  If you were a parent that was worried about your child reading about these kinds of things, well welcome to life.  Most books have a true story behind them and I believe that everyone needs to learn about this kind of stuff sometime in their life.  Most of what we learn today comes from the books we read.     Also, everyone today listens to music.  We find music as a way to relax and have a good time wheather your riding in a car or at a party.  Many of the songs today contain foul language and have sexual meanings, but that doesn't mean that you have to listen to them.  Many older people don't want to listen to these kinds of songs but it is what many kids are listening to today.  What many people don't see though, is that these songs have true meaning behind them and it is really a way of life.     Finally, I believe that magazines, movies, and any other types of media, shouldn't be removed from libraries.  Many people turn to magazines as a way to relax and read about the latest fashions or their favorite athlete.  We watch movie to also relax and have a good laugh every once in a while.  No one should remove these sources of entertainment from our people even if some @MONTH1 think they are inappropriate.       I strongly believe that romoving any books, magazines, movies, music, or any other typed of media would have a negative effect on alot of people.  You would be removing sources of entertainment and ways of learning from people.  How would you feel if you went to your local library one day and most, if not all, materials had been removed?  What would you do if you didn't have any of these materials available to you anymore.Intelligent life is all around us   Intelligent life is all around us      When you watch King Kong or The Planet

"No I as an @CAPS1 cetazine do not feel that any materials should be removed. There are many reason I feel this way and I hope that after people have read this they will agree with me. THere are three main points supporting my opinion and i plan to list them below.      First and for most is the fact that this is @LOCATION1. @LOCATION1 is suposed to be the land of the free and the home of the brave, or at least thats what the national anthem tells me. So to me if some one removes a book or movie from a library becasue they find it offencive they are trying to take away one of my right as an @CAPS1 cetacine. The right they are messing with to me is the right of freedom. I should be free to be able to walk into a library and grab any book i wish. I should be free to go to the movie store and find and rent any movie a choose from the shelf. If they put a movie or book away if they make it to were i can't get to it then they are messing with my freedom, and this is somthing i can't stand as an @CAPS1. I should be free to read or watch what ever i choose to.     Which brings me to my next point. This point is a simple and logical one. My second point is that people have the choice to read or watch the movie. Just because it is there it does not meen that they have to read or watch it. If someone doesn't like a book good for them don't read it. If someone doesn't like a movie good for them don't watch it. It is rather quit simple in my opinion if someone doesn't like said book or movie then just leave it alone and don't mess with it. They shouldn't have the right to ruin it for everone else. Just because one or two or even twenty people find a book offencive doesn't mean they have the right to remove it. There @MONTH1 five million other people out their who love said book so why ruin for everyone just to make a few people happy. They do have the right to say no and not read or watch the movie, but they don't have the right to say i can't.     Finaly people say that said book or movie should be removed because a child might get it and it is not apropreat for children. Well to that I have to say it is the parents job to make sure a child is not readind or watching something they shouldn't. If i child gets a hold of a book that is said to be bad it is the parents job to tell them to put it back. People don't have the right to completly remove said book or movie just because a kid might get it.      So there is my opinion on this little matter. I don't feel that libraries should be censored. I feel we all have the right o make own decisions and that we have the right to read or watch what ever we choose. It is not fair to get ride of a book just because a few people don't like it. Hundreds of othes might love it, and like I said before if someone doesn't like a certain movie or book then don't read it or watch it. Don't ruin it for everyone else though..Is this your life, Jackie Brown?.religion   That's my decision      Papa Henry was full of spice   He was a man usually nice   But something got into him last night   Made him want to fuss and holler   The entire house was in a sweat   His bottle got broken and the floor got wet   ""Clean it up!"".Don't want to fight anymore oh no   Don't want to cry anymore no more   Don't want to fight anymore oh no   Don't want to cry anymore no more      One nation   One family   No limitation   No enemy      No I don't want to fight anymore   No I don't, I don't, no I don't   No I don't want to cry anymore   Don't want to cry   No I don't, I don't   No I don't, oh no      No weapons   No secrecy   All slogans   Blind loyalty      No I don't want to fight anymore   No I don't, I don't, no I don't, no I don't   No I don't want to cry anymore   No I don't, I don't, no I don't, no I don't      You know I don't, you know I don't   You know I don't, you know I don't want to cry   You know I don't, you know I don't   You know I don't, you know I don't   You know I don't, you know I don't   You know I don't, you know I don't want to fight   You know I don't, you know I don't      No righteous   No cruelty   No weapons   No self-defense   No quarrel   No arrogance   No hurt you   Rise above revenge      No I don't want to fight anymore   No I don't, no I don't don't don't   No I don't want to cry anymore   No I don't no I don't      Do I want to fight anymore oh no   Don't want to cry anymore no more   I don't no I don't   No I don't want to fight anymore   I don't no I don't      Don't want to fight anymore oh no   Don't want to cry anymore no more   No I don't want to fight anymore   No I don't no I don't   No I don't want to cry anymore   No I don't no I don't no I don't!.Oh, it's so evil, my love..Can you read my mind?.I saw my baby, trying hard as babe could try   What could I do?.I Still Love You   Words and music by Ray Boltz and Steve Millikan   There's a fire in my heart tonight   I feel it in my soul   It's getting brighter every day   Lord, you came into my life   A long time ago   And here I am tonight   I've just got to say   Chorus:   I still love You   I still love You   I am not ashamed   I still love You   I still love You   I'm here to praise Your name   Some days I must confess   The feelings aren't the same   My heart just feels so very cold   But Your hand of love and mercy   Keeps me pressing on   And even when I don't feel it   Deep inside I know   Chorus   This world is full of promises   None of them are true   But Your word   Will never pass away   I want to follow You   Chorus   I still love You   I still love You   I am not ashamed   I still love You   I still love You   I am not ashamed   To praise Your name   I still love You   (c)1989 Shepherd Boy Musicascap (adm.

"Whever you go these days you see viloence in evry store around the world. Children growing up in the world is our future and they see that negative output. Alot of the kids and young adults thrive off of the offensive materials the world puts out there.               I think that the offensive thing's should be taken off the shelves. And sold in stores for adults that are twenty one and older. If people sell offensive things in stores were it allows young teenagers to buy those products , then we are just puting ourselfs at harm. I was just in a book store the other day and i seen magazines that were not apporiate. I thought to myself how could they sell these types of magazines. Music , movies, and magazines shouldn't even be sold in a book store , that's why its called a book store.                It's not called a movie, music , or magazine store they call it a book store for a reason. If students read books or listen to music that is offensive they are going to grow up thinking it's ok. Too be that way or treat somebody different because of who they are or what they represent. I'm not saying take all the books out of the store just take the offensive one's and have a twenty one or older sign. So the kids dont end up getting a hold of the book and learning something they shouldn't.               When i was young i went to the book store all the time with my mom. I would just pick up any book there was and start trying to read. Alot of the time my mom would take the book from me. Because it was offensive, i didn't know that at the time i was just a little kid. In today's society kids are growing up quicker than they really have to and thats not a good thing. Kids should be able to be kids and read kid's books.               I guess it does'nt really matter for middle school and high school kids. Because those kids really dont like to read at all. The kids that we have to look out for is the one's in elementary. Because those kid's actually want to learn how to read. And if we put a book about drugs on the shelve those kids will read it. And those kids will learn about it and be curious to what that drug has a effect on you.               In the end it does'nt really matter what i say because people are going to keep making books. Anytime type of book it is all based on how much money they can make. It does'nt matter if it is negative or a possitive book. the company wants to make money and so does the author..Need I explain?.Doesn't matter if it's all okay..Oh   Dis con nec ted..We had it all, just you and me   Now there's a doorway to my heart without a key      So I'm calling out, I'm calling out to the only one   Who can save us from what we've done   Don't leave me hanging on   I'm reaching out and praying you'll come back again   It's just darkness I'm living in   And you're the only place my heart has ever been..And the dealer wants you thinking   That it's either black or white..It's so hard to touch   What is out of our hands,   To know and to trust   What the heart understands..Worldly treasures will all pass away   There's just one thing's put here to stay      Ashes to ashes, dust into dust   Kingdoms will crumble, bridges will rust,   Mountains will disappear, rivers will dry on   And so it goes with everything but love,   So it goes, everything but love,   So it goes, everything but love,   So it goes, everything but love..Think I'll let her keep on going   Where ever it is, she's goin' to..""See the light ram through the gaps in the land."".I said he rambled   Rambled all around... in and out of town   Didn't he ramble... oh didn't he ramble   He rambled till the butcher shot him down      He slipped into the cat house..made love to the stable   Madam caught him cold... said I'll pay you when I be able   Six months had passed... and she stood all she could stand   She said buddy when I'm through with you      Ole groundhog gonna be shakin' yo' hand   And didn't he ramble... he rambled   Rambled all around... in and out of town   Oh didn't he ramble... he rambled      You know he rambled...

"I do not believe that materiales in libraries should be censored. If parents don't want their children reading or listening to inappropriate things, they should pay more attention to what they are doing. If parents monitor their children closer they will be able to control what they are doing. There are alot of bad things for children to read, look at, and listen too out there. Parents need to do a better job teaching their children about what they can and should look at, read, or listen too.     It isn't often when you go to the library that you find something inappropriate unless you are looking for something inappropriate. It is very easy to tell what is good and what is bad. Most of the time in a library the more profound books and magazines are seperated from the childrens books. This, to me, is the way it should be in all libraries. In all of the times i have been to a library i have never accedentally come across something inappropriate. A library is a place for people of all ages it should not be limited to just one age group.     If libraries were censored more people would be upset. It would be the same way if a store stopped selling your favorite product because one person did not like it. Alot of adults probably would not go if the library were censored. The library would then become a place for mostly children. Most small children do not even go to the library so they would become virtually useless.     In all of my years I have never once heard of someone being deeply offended by something at a library. Weather it be in a magazine, on the news, or by word of mouf, I have never seen a complaint. Most parents do a good job of monitering what the children look at or read. Those parents should not be deprived of their privelages to look at more adult rated things if they choose. Just because one parent was to irresponsible to moniter their child does not mean that all of the parents should be punished.     The library is a place for people of all ages. Therefor the library should keep material for people of all ages and not just for children. The bottomline is that if people do not want their kids looking at inappropriate things they should keep a better watch over them. They should also teach them the difference in what is acceptable and what is not acceptable..It's a half-awake story, and   It will be better if you close your eyes..Hey you,   Have you felt like this before?.Seems its already morning   I see the sky, its so beautiful and blue   The TV's on   But the only thing showing is a picture of you      Oh, I get up and make myself some coffee   I try to read a bit but the story's too thin   Then I thank the Lord above   That you're not there to see me   In this shape I'm in      Spending my time   Watching the days go by   Feeling so small   I stare at the wall   Hoping that you think of me too   I'm spending my time      I try to call but I don't know what to tell you   I leave a kiss on your answering machine   Oh, help me please   Is there someone who can make me   Wake up from this dream?.And if I decide on leavin' my world will end today..This is it   Hey now, don't it make you feel better?.For when they placed it on his head   He began to dance around..I like Jack Benny's jokes,   To a degree..(You're so dramatic).Just because we're a little different, you gotta run?.The grey's leakin' through the door..Why must we hide emotions?.Should I be hungry?.Whoa   I'm definitely sure   That I'm not sure   Whoa      Sittin' on the corner of nowhere road   Just between ""I wish I could""   And ""I don't know""   Rain is splashing up between   Her toes   She doesn't know her own area code   She's the picture   Of a heart of gold   On the edge of depression I note   And a picture   Of the wrong high road   Now it's too late for   A fight or foe      Now she's lookin' at me to know   The faucet's runnin'   And my car got towed      I'm sure about it   I'm definitely sure   That I do surely doubt it   I wish that I could say   That I was sure about it   I'm definitely sure   That I'm not sure   Whoa      Did you see the man   With the cocaine load?.so, no matter what goes on, no matter   What happens, always remember...I love you!.Mack was ruthless   Mack was feared   Perhaps it's better that he disappeared   Yet I know, that he was bad   I could fall in love with,   Fall in love with the lad!.I Love Your Breasts The Way They Are   (I Love You Just The Way You Are-Billy Joel)      Don't go padding your bra to please me   You never had much chest before mmmm   And don't imagine your hoots is Jewed-ah   'cuz I don't need a whole lot more      Oh You'd probably leave me if they were bigger   Your bust would keep me from your heart mmmmm   I'd miss the good times..Some days I feel like my shadow's casting me   Some days the sun don't shine   Sometimes I wonder what tomorrow's gonna bring   When I think about my dirty life and times      One day I came to a fork in the road   Folks, I just couldn't go where I was told   Now they'll hunt me down and hang me for my crimes   If I tell about my dirty life and times      I had someone 'til she went out for a stroll   Should have run after her   It's hard to find a girl with a heart of gold   When you're living in a four-letter world      And if she won't love me then her sister will   She's from Say-one-thing-and-mean-another's-ville   And she can't seem to make up her mind   When she hears about my dirty life and times      Some days I feel like my shadow's casting me   Some days the sun don't shine   Sometimes I wonder why I'm still running free   All up and down the line      Gets a little lonely, folks, you know what I mean   I'm looking for a woman with low self-esteem   To lay me out and ease my worried mind   While I'm winding down my dirty life and times      Who'll lay me out and ease my worried mind   While I'm winding down my dirty life and times.You're all I know of love..Threshold, Skin, Fortress, Win - A life of sin   Pliers, Tension, Toy Store, Grace - The human race   Raking, Fourteen, Basket, Screw - Now how 'bout you?.Oh no, that cat thought he was just too grand!.Oh, Lord, now I feel so much older..With all this pressure on me?"
"Censoring books in libraries because a certain group of people doesn't like them, and finds them offensive is simply not fair.  A good library is diverse and has something that everyone of different backgrounds can enjoy.                 A compromise wouldn't be as difficult as some people might actually think.  Simply regulating books, and other products, by creating age limits based on the books content and maturity level would be an excellent alternative to actually censoring the books themselves.  Take an author like @PERSON1 for example.  His books contain subject matter and offensive crude language that would obviously not be deemed acceptable for most younger people.  That being said censoring the books language wouldn't help in the slightest. If a younger person has the mental capability to read a book like @PERSON1 then they would have no problem making inferences on what matierial was said, and the ideas in the writing are going to be realized.                  The other fact is that taking out mature level books completley from the libraries is not a possible solution either. If you take out the diversity in your product your going to lose the diversity in your customer's as well. For instance think about a movie store. If the only movies sold were @CAPS1 and @CAPS2 there would be a lot less people wanting to go to that store, because then it just turns into a child's store. Even censoring the movies would not be effective because your taking away the art of having an unfiltered movie.                   So my simple solution is obvious. Movies have ratings based on maturity content, so why shouldn't books. Books that deal with more controversal content shouldn't be placed in the shelves next to young readers' books, and they should have a label indicating that the specific book @MONTH1 contain material not suitable for a person under a specific age. People trying to censor entertainment and look into the best interest of their loved ones is perfectly fine, but you cant blindfold them forever. Were all on the same planet and we all reach the age of realization of reality..I like it like that   I have only one burning desire   Oh, can I make love with your fire?.I will be king!.Why must we live the days at such a frightening pace?.Woke up this morning, put on my own clothes,   Cause the ladys' not here, to help us no more..That may be all I need to know..[Z-Ro]   Time and time again, I try to cope with being poor   But I had to say just what I feel, so now I'm kicking in your door   My daughter needs pampers and milk   And my mind is confused on how we gone survive   So when you me strapped it looking with a bad one   You looking at the face of a desperate man I'm bringing the pain out with 45   But then I, fuck around and slip on my ski mask, ready to blast   Then I come through the door with a motherfucking 4-4   I want the Rolex watches and cash, and you can call the laws   I got another clip in my drawers, there'll be screaming and officers down   Because it's all about the money ain't a damn thing funny   What you got I'ma have out town, 'fore they put my ass in the ground   (Chorus - 2x)   Gotta get my pimp on, pimp on   When a nigga be hustling on them corners   Gotta get my pimp on, pimp on   When a nigga be moving marijuana   Gotta get my pimp on, pimp on   Better watch your back when it get mad   Gotta get my pimp on, pimp on   Everything in front of me's up for grabs   [Z-Ro]   Hell of a hustler, got to work my muscle   got to be wondering around, in the streets   Got to feet my feet, when I steel sweets   on a solo creep, nothing but a thug   Should of drove to them hoes, never wanted hoes   Got to keep my mind on my money, cause I got a dream   While pulling up on the scene, jumping out of paper land   Tell me if Hilfiger chose those jeans   Got a crease, and it never ceased to amaze me   By the individual hustle, that'd pay me   When I got to provide for my baby, and maybe   I be creaming the fucking, music and deep got to hit the week   Got to get a fat pocket, on a get it out free   Not the H.P.D., even though Ft.

"Do you think books, music, movies, magazines, etc. that could be offenesive should or should not be pulled off the shelves? I beleave they shouldn't. All kinds of people buy books or movies and they all have diffrent types they like.     Companies that manufactor books, movies, music, and magazines would be looseing out on money if people cant find something they like. and if they dont have the money to make whatever it is they make then they will go out of buiesness. They you might be out of luck for what you are looking for.     All kinds of people buy things that they like. How would you like it if your favorite candy was taken off the shevles because it offened people? Well thats how they feel when that happens to them.      What would be put in there places? Stores have to have something to fill the shevles. Would they put more candy to make the world fat?      If you come across something you think is offensive just dont pay attenion to it.

"A curious child goes into the library for the first time to find a story to read. Yet, when she goes to the children's section, the book she wants is not allowed in this library becuase it is said to promote certain ideals to children. The child goes to her older sister for help to find a different book. The older sister is to busy looking for her own book. She had walked into the library looking to find answers to her questions over a liberal topic. She can't find the book she wants, the library has censored it.      Why would we censor librairies if we have the freedom of the press and the freedom of speech? It is not right to censor libraries becuase that is restricitng what is allowed to be read, which is taking away part of our freedom. The press is allowed to print anything, and we the people read it. Will that be the next thing that is censored? A book is just like the newspaper, it is relaying a story to entertain the auidence that is reading it.      By censoring libraires that is taking away the freedom of speech. Writing is a way to express yourself. Authors share there expressions through writing, hoping they can touch someone else's life and be of some assistance. Whether the book helps its reader to escape a horrendus day or to answer the questions of a curious teenager. I use books daily to escape the stresses of life, the '@CAPS1 @CAPS2' series gave me something to do and allowed me to use my imagination and mind, I could escape into another world and leave my chores behind me.      Some @MONTH1 say that offensive things should be censored. In our culture the slightest thing can called 'offensive' now. If we never learn about these 'offensive' things how would we understand history? There will always be rude things that have been said, but we should be exposed to them so we can learn from it. By censoring these items we will never learn and  neither will our children about other cultures, history, or liberal ideas.      Instead of censoring items, there is another solution. Make certain items restricted and red flagged. If certain items become restricted; it would mean that people over a certain age are allowed to read them. By doing this a child's mind would not be polluted, but we could still be exposed to different ideas and learn from them. If there was a system to red flag an item, this would allow the reader to know that this item contains what could be considered offensive material so they do not have to expose their selves to it if they did not want to, but others could. This would work becuase the books could stay in the library and still be used but there would be a warning system for those who do not want to be around it or allow their children to be around it.      In conclusion censoring libraries is a bad idea. It takes away our freedom of the press and speech.We are also making ourselves ignorant this way. If we put out a warning system it is fair to everyone. The 'offensive' matterial can stay in the libaries but people will know ahead of time what they are being exposed to and what their children are to.He was very sad, and he was crying..smacked on my

"Do your rights end where mine begin? In such a diverse society, clashing opinions are unavoidable. Does that mean another human's rights should be abused because we don't agree with their practices, beliefs, or lifestyle?     Everyone in this world is entitaled to their own opinion. What is wrong to some people @MONTH1 be right to others. For example, one family @MONTH1 view their children using curse words as offensive while another @MONTH1 see no problem. Diversity in beliefs does not mean that it is acceptable to censor society from cursing, religion, or violence disscused in published works. These concepts exist in the world and censoring them will not make them disappear.     It is understood that there is both bad and good in the world, and pulling materials from the shelves of libraries will not change that. Censoring books, magazines, music, and other media is denying someone the ability so see ideas from all points of view. Whether or not you prevent a young child from seeing all perspecitves does not mean the bad and good do not exist. The saying 'one year older, one year wiser' can refer to the aknowledgement of different ideas and opinions. As a child grows, he will learn more about the materials that were censored.     In some cases, such as in the classroom, your rights do end where mine begin. When it comes to learning about the beauty of diversity, everyone is able to choose what they pick from the shelf. The definition of 'offensive material' is simply a matter of opinion..What am I doin'?...What else, what else is there to do ?.You can be beautiful too..As you shoot across the sky-y-y      Baby you're a firework   Come on let your colors burst   Make 'em go ""oh, oh, oh!"".When Liberty Valance walked around,   The men would step aside   Because the point of a gun   Was the only law that Liberty understood..Just a smile and the rain is gone   Can hardly believe it (yeah)   There's an angel standing next to me   Reaching for my heart      Just a smile and there's no way back   Can hardly believe it (yeah)   But there's an angel and she's calling me   Reaching for my heart      I know, that I'll be ok now   This time it's real      I lay my love on you   It's all I want to do   Every time I breathe I feel brand new   You open up my heart   Show me all your love, and walk right through   As I lay my love on you      I was lost in a lonely place   Could hardly believe it (yeah)   Holding on to yesterdays   Far, far too long      Now I believe it's okay cause   This time it's real      I lay my love on you   It's all I want to do   Every time I breathe I feel brand new   You open up my heart   Show me all your love, and walk right through   As I lay my love on you      I never knew that love could feel so good      Like a once in a lifetime   You change my world      I lay my love on you'..I'd like to know that your love   Is just a love, I can be sure of   So tell me now and I won't ask again   Will you still love me?.Burning down the house..Watch me, now..And I know it hurts when it's taken away, I tell ya that I could be livin   Today with you, always thought you okay..Winter and moonlight   It's an old-fashioned song   Julie's in blue jeans   Now her love has gone      She's an old-fashioned feelin'   She's an old-fashioned song   Julie's in love now, but love has gone      It's a natural thing   It's a natural thing      I never knew her   I never tried   Julie would run by   Cryin', teary-eyed      She was old-fashioned feelin'   She was old-fashioned song   Julie's in blue lace   And love has gone   Her love has gone      It's a natural thing   It's a natural thing   It's a natural thing      Oh, she was old-fashioned feelin'   She was old-fashioned song, yes Julie   Now Julie's in blue lace   And love has gone   Well, love has gone   Well, love has gone      It's a natural thing      Julie, Julie.What would you do if I loved you too?.But nothing is perfect   In God's perfect plan   He only gave us the good things   So we'd understand..At my door the leaves are falling   The cold wild wind will come   Sweethearts walk by together   And I still miss someone      I go out to wild the parties   And look for a little fun   But I find the darkened corner   'Cause I still miss someone      Though I never got over those blue eyes   I see them everywhere   I miss those arms that held me   When all the love was there   I wonder if she's sorry for   For leaving what we had begun   There's someone for me somewhere   And I still miss someone      Though I never got over those blue eyes   I see them everywhere   I miss those arms that held me   When all the love was there   I wonder if she's sorry for   For leaving what we had begun   There's someone for me somewhere   And I still miss someone.Little Joe struggles just to get up on his feet..Second mortgage..What if I say I'm not like the others?.What you gonna do with those ol' blue jeans you wear?.I got it bad, so bad,   I'm hot for teacher..But you're holding on stronger,      And oh how hard it is to let go..Does it make you feel safer?"
"Billions of books float from shelf to shelf each day: fictional and nonfictional, horror and comedy. Writers reside in every part of the world composing works from complex life experiences to simple dreams. Being an author, who has the right to freedom of speech, story plots become to have endless combinations. Every reader seeks out a different style.          Libraries contain books that tower to the ceilings, any kind, every kind. Books are divided into their individual sections according to truth, kind and cover, each category holding about four options. The necessity for censorship should never be an option. Writers compose for all sorts of people. For some to say what's 'right' or 'wrong' is not a legitamate reason for a piece of work to be removed from a shelf. If, perhaps, more books had ratings such as movies do, an @CAPS1 @NUM1 cubicle could be created instead of allowing young people to have access to such vulgarity. Taking away the enjoyment for some readers, however, is unethical.          Whether pertaining to books, music, magazines, etc., censorship is unnecessary. Those who compose the entertainment should not have to worry about the content of their expression and/or interpretation. If the worry is concerning youth, parental guidance should be in affect. Resulting in cancellation can affect those who relate to the source so it's important to consider all options.

"Yes there are many things today that have censorship,but should keep them out of our libraries.I think not.They should not be taken items out of the libraries do to censorships.Maybe if they are such a big concern they could do something else with them besides taking them out.     I don't believe that they shouldn't take out censorship items out of the libraries just becase some people have a problem with it.Becase now a days you can go out in public and hear the same stuff they put in those censored movies,games,@CAPS1's,etc.I think that if they are even thinking about taking cencored product out of the library it should be up to the library and not the goverment.     If censorship is such a big problem with people they dont have to check it out or look at it. So maybe if they are having problem's with parents becase there kids are checking he censored items out they should have a band.Like if you want to out a item with a censorship you either have to be @NUM1 or have a parent or guardin with you.But if it is still have a problem with it make it like tabacco products were you have to be @NUM1.     Then if the libraries don't want to do that they could make a whole room just for censored items.They sould also put the room in a corner or in a less populated area of the library.There should also have to have a sign saying there are sencorhip items in that room and, maybe a sign saying @NUM1 and older.     So there are many other was to dealing with censored items.Sence there are so many was to deal with them why take them out.We should not have to take censorship item out just becase some people do not like it.why punish every one becase of a few people.And then being close to you again..I know that woman in the mirror   That creature has my thoughts as eyes   He saw her once and then forgot her

"Certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive. The material should be removed if they offend their gender. Also, the material should be removed if it offend's their religion. Finally, it should be removed if it offend's their race.     The material should be removed if it is offensive to anyone's gender. First, the material can make a person feel unworthy. Second, the material can cause an large altercation between the author and the person who is being offended and maybe others. Third, the material can also harm someone by them picking up the book and reading the text.     Also, the material should be removed if it is offensive to anyone's religion. This can cause someone to hate every other person with the same religion as the writer, song writer, actor, and/or director. Second, the library should be about education, fun, and interesting contents not by offending someones religion.

"Should books, music, movies, magazines, etc. be removed from libraries if they are found offensive? My opinion on this is no. In this essay I will explain my opinion and hopefully change other peoples opinions. I will also explain how the past has an effect on present day.       In some cases books, music, movies, magazines, etc. @MONTH1 offend any race or a sertain sex, but that is what happened in the history of the @LOCATION1. Some @MONTH1 be very offensive but it only shows a past, others @MONTH1 just be plain out racist or sexist. Those that show the @LOCATION1 @LOCATION1 history are an education sorce so we can learn from mistakes. Here is exactly why I state this opinion, taking this material off shelves is like taking someones freedom of speach away. I hate when I here music that disrespects women but im not going to try and get it taken away because it might just be expressing how the artist of the song loved someone or how history for their family @MONTH1 have been.     In conclusion, I believe this material should not be taken off the shelves. After explaining my opinion think about what is offensive or just someone expressing a past memory. If a past was offensive something tody might be offensive, as I was told earlier in my life treat others as you want to be treated. I hope i caught attention and changed some opinions because alot of offence today has resulted from the past.Darling   Just the way you look tonight..Baby   What you got comin' is a      Sure thing   Sure thing   One-hundred-percent guaranteed love that's true   Just for you..Whatcha gonna do whatcha gonna do when they come for you?.[Chorus: x2]   Tell me, tell me, tell me,   Something I don't know,   Something I don't know,   Something I don't know,      How many inches in a mile,   What it takes to make you smile..Na, na, na....You've got to work if you should have to save..Everyone is saying you don't love me,   Say it isn't so..[Chorus]      Got so much to offer, but I can't pay the rent,   I can't buy you roses 'cause the money's all spent..Be yourself no matter what they say..Can't forget about you..They went up!.Turn off your conscience   Leave the world outside   Nothing at all can ever make you feel   That anything's so real so you just   Disconnect      The key to save yourself if for nothing else   A tongue can never hold the truth of silence is golden   With a broken heart underneath all of the pain   Do you stroke the pretty scars?.By your side for right or wrong      Right or wrong it's got to be..[Chorus:]      Can't blame you (as above)   See me now, see me no more   I heard that whistle blow   I knew it's time to go   Sitting here in this train   Going so fast past the trees   I'm thinking of words to apologize   'Cause sorry ain't enough      [Chorus:]      Can't blame you (till fade).(You're the man Eddie)      (Eddie, you're the man)      There's no way to tell to be sure   Ticket I'm a-wantin'   This bus it's makin' way too many stops   I can't get a-movin'   Where's my destination?.Everyone has times when they are moved by not so surprising   Developments..Last time I saw him   He sweetly kissed my lips   Last time I saw him   He said ""I'll be back for more of this""   Last time I saw him   We were crying at the bus   I knew he hated leaving   But he had to set us up      I gave him money   I know I invested well   Mamma doesn't trust him   But he loves me I can tell      Each time the greyhound   Arrives at nine o' clock   But I don't start my crying   'Till that last man's gotten off      Last time I saw him   Last time I saw my honey   Last time I saw him   He was Greyhound-bound   But I'm still waiting here   Without a fear   That bus will someday turn around      I had no letter   It's been six months, maybe better   I try forgetting him   But I love him more then ever      I have decided   I've waited long enough   If there was nothing wrong   He would return right on that bus      There must be trouble   So I'm leavin' on the double   If he can't get to me   I know he needs me desperately      Last time I saw him   Last time I saw my honey   Last time I saw him   He was looking fine   And as he waved goodbye   He said don't cry   I'm coming back, no rain or shine      Last time I saw him   Last time I saw my honey   Last time I saw him   He was greyhound-bound   And as he waved goodbye   He said don't cry   I'm coming back, no rain or shine      La de da, la da do   Do la da da, da da da      Last time I saw him   He was looking fine   And as he waved goodbye   He said don't cry   I'm coming back, no rain or shine.I want to live like this forever..Do you have an answer, science man?.No, this I won't deny..So I went to the doctor   See what he could give me   He said Son, son, you've gone too far..Niemand zal mij, daar op het land,   hoop ik, ooit een standje geven."
"I belive that all literature of any kind is useful even though it could be offensive.  If society plans on taking something off the shelf because it offends a race or gender, than many life-lesson books, movies, magazines, music, etc., would be removed from the shelves.  Things such as books or movies are there to take people to different worlds, to help them learn knowledge, to teach them lessons that the real world @MONTH1 not teach them.  If materials are taken off the shelf in fear of offending someone, then not very many things will be left just like Katherine Paterson says in her quote.  If certian literature were not around anymore then it definitly would not be the same as it is now.  Literature are there for us, they teach us, and if if one @CAPS1 was taken away, it would start a riot.     Books are always there for us, when we are bored, lonely, or just want to escape reality.  Imagine if you we not able to read your favorite book because it was no longer considered appropriate for society.  If all books had to be appropriate for every age, it would take all the interesting out of everything.  Whether it is a novel or a regular encyclopedia, all books would be dulled down to exceed the needs of our 'non offending' society.  Lots of music would lose it's luster and magazines would not be able to gossip about the 'hottest new things.'  Movies would get too boring to watch and many things in society would fall apart.     Books, documentaries, magazines, are there to help people learn, either if its a lesson about what not to do while your young, such as smoking, if books about smoking were taken away because it offended the part of society that chose to smoke then how would any of the teens today know not to start smoking?  Novels are usually fiction, but the characters come to life to readers.  They have problems just life people of the real world even though they @MONTH1 not be real themsleves, so if one reads that book, the way that character handles the situation could help a real life person decide on what they should do about there problem.  Important history books of movies could be taken away becaus it 'offends' @CAPS2 @CAPS3 to have students learn about slaves.     If one @CAPS1 was taken from the shelf because of offending someone then more and more materials would be taken away form society.  What good does that do anyone?  It leaves many students uneducated about many things that they need to be educated about.  It would disrupt the order in libraries if books were being removed because of aproppriateness.  If books were being judged on appropriateness then many authors would not be able to write the novels and literature that they do now.  No good would come of removing anything from the shelves of libraries.     Books, movies, magazines, music, it is all too important to society, it keep us company, it teaches us, is makes life easier at times when the world wants to kick you while you are down.  If one person decided that a book was not appropriate then they can chose not to read it, but they should not decide to help remove that book from the shelves of libraries.  They would start a landslide of trouble that would effect everyone in the @LOCATION1 and maybe even across the globe.  Information of any kind is a good @CAPS1 no matter the content of it.  So removing any sort of material from our libraries is a horrible idea..This information is yours for free..Were you there when they laid him in the tomb?.(wilkinson)   Love is the liar that no one can blame   Everyone knows how it feels   All of us given to lose or to gain   So I won't question your reasons for keeping me   Keeping me here now it's late   Taking your time, making sure of mine   Looking for something to say   That would further your nervous design   Wish I could tell you that I feel the same   And it's keeping me here now it's late   I believe you got to me and you know it   I believe you won't let go   I believe you got to me   I know that you feel it too   Got to me, got to you   Looking at you sitting looking at me   Feeling the night slip away   To the morning away to the day   Let it stay sleeping, nothing can keep me   Away from you now that it's late   I believe you got to me and you know it   I believe you won't let go   I believe you got to me, can you show it   If you can then he has to know   I believe you got to me   I know that you feel it too   Got to me, got to you.Bawl!...It's better if it's worse than before..You'll find yourself in a gutter,   Right back where you came from..M alone   But where should I go   I feel like I miss you so      Verse 2:   I shy away from love these days      Because?.Oh yeah, she's in love with him........Waiting to, waiting to get you, inso....Both: So there's no doubt   We're well cut out   To run life's marathon...

"A @CAPS1 is a place for people of all ages to come and get a book, magazine, music, movies and much more. Libraries are a key essential to learning and helping those with reading skills. Studies show that reading will make you much smarter and able to understand and comprehend well. However, in my opinion, offensive reading, viewing or listening material does not belong in libraries, to some extent.     As I stated earlier, libraries are a place of learning and for developing skills. Books that are for 'adults' can be found in adult type stores or even at a regular local book store. Parents bring their children to the @CAPS1 to support their reading ability and to advance it. They don't want to have to worry about making sure their kids are not looking at anything bad.      A few years back, I herd about a teenage boy that would go into the @CAPS1 about once a week to look for movies that this parnents would not approve of. Later on that boy was caught and punished. If those kinds of movies were not there in the first place, his parents would not of had to worry about it. Almost everywhere you go and everything to see and hear has some type of wrong background to it. Parents should feel okay and worry-free when it comes to letting their kids do something as simple as going to the @CAPS1. This problem can be easily fixed with removing that issue.      I strongly believe that @CAPS1 material should be censored in the way that those who should not see it, can not see it. On the other hand, material such as religious or cultural learning items that people find offensive should not be taken off the shelves. Religious and cultural books, music, movies, and/or magazines are for those to learn. Form what I have seen, someone @MONTH1 want, for example, a book about @CAPS2 taken off the shelf because they are @CAPS3 and might not support their religious ways. I find this wrong because it is a free country that includes freedom of religion and they can't be denied informing others about that religion.     Libraries are a place to feel safe and relaxed. Everyone likes to sit in the @CAPS1 for hours and soak in a good novel.

"The subject of censorship in libraries has been brought upon many times. Censorship is a rule prohibiting the view of a book, music, movies, magazines, etc. This censorship is because of it's rating or the content in it is inapropriate for some viewers/readers. Of course, many people have their own opinions about this censorship in libraries, as do I.      I believe that censorship is a good idea in some cases. These cases being music, or movies. However, I don't believe censorship is a good idea in books. Children all over the world read books and as time goes on, our children are becoming more and more advanced and read on higher levels. This is where censorship comes into play. Libraries want to censor higher reading level books because these books include profanity, violence, sex, drugs, and any other aspect of adultry. I disagree with the censorship of these books because this is basically telling our children that they can't challenge themselves or they can't learn about certain things because of their age.      These books, in my opinion, can only help them. These books will help them learn about society, what's wrong and what's right, and will help them, grow as they get older. The higher reading level books help them understand words better, and also help them learn about literature and past times.      When I was in middle school, I was not an advanced reader by any means, but I did like to read occasionally. One day, I went to the library in search of a challenging book. The book I found was a book called '@CAPS1 @CAPS2' by @PERSON1. This book was a fictional story taking place during the @LOCATION1 @CAPS3. As I put in my pin number to check out the book at the front desk, the librarian informed me that I couldn't check out the book because it was a young adult book, meaning 'too advanced' for me. She said I needed parent consent before I was able to check it out.     That night, I asked my parents about it and asked if I could read it. They said yes, mostly because they were so thrilled that I even wanted to read a book so challenging. The next day I got a note from home informing the librarian that I could read the book. I was so thrilled when I was finally able to check out the book and read it.      From my experience with the library censorship, I think that the best route to take is that if there is a parent/guardian who is over @NUM1, and they approve of the checking out of the book/magazine or whatever it @MONTH1 be, then the child or student is allowed to check out said book/magazine etc.     In conclusion, the censorship of books, magazines, etc. is an overall mediocre idea, with some exceptions. The rule of parent/guardian consent is the best route to take in my opinion.Of course, this subject will be argued for many years to come and many people will have their own opinions. Each side of the argument has valid points, but I think that it is imparative that we keep censorship out of books and keep our children learning and reading at their highest ability, no matter what the reading level is..And the jailer man and sailor Sam   Were searching every one   For the band on the run,   Band on the run      Yeah the band on the run,   Band on the run   Band on the run

"Is @CAPS1 Right?     Is @CAPS1 right to have censorship in libraries? This question could be answered in two very different opinions. Some people @MONTH1 want all censorship items out of public areas. On the other hand, there are people that @MONTH1 like to read this type of material. This is a very opinionated topic.     In my opinion, libraries are places I go to find a book to read, research, listen to music, rent movies, or relax while looking at a magazine. Libraries are puble areas and not everyone is going to agree. Everyone has their own favorite book or genre. I believe @CAPS1 is unjustiful to take away censorship in libraries because this @MONTH1 be ones favorite genre. Why do libraries need to limit their choice while noone else does? For example, many parents would love if all clothes stores would ban holes in jeans because they are to revealing. The stores don't. They do not ban holes in jeans because many teenage girls like holes in their jeans. American @CAPS2 is not going to band capris just because I do not like them. There are different favorites, likes, dislikes, and opinions.     A great resolution for this dissagreement is catorigizing. By putting all of the censorshiped books, movies, magazines, and music in one area, @CAPS1 will decrease arguments on this topic because all of the people that like censorship in libraries will be together in their area. Where as the people that do not want the censorship in libraries do not have to be around @CAPS1. This is a quick and easy fix.      There is no reason to take away ones favorite genre because someone doesn't like @CAPS1. If this is true then our world will have nothing because not everyone likes one certain thing. For instance, I do not like blue aeropostale shirts. Pink are my favorite. My friend @CAPS3 likes the blue shirts and hates the pink shirts. We both write to the manager to get rid of the shirt color we do not like. This is nonbenifical for either of us because now the one we do not like is got but so is the one we do like. This is nonsense. There will be nothing left in the store. Pople in charge can easily sort material at a store or a library to make @CAPS1 fit the communities likings. Getting rid of material is not the answer. Catorigizing is the fix that needs to be put into action immediatly.But I'm too clean for these boys   I require what I desire   I got stripes Adidas   Mami scream papi no mas   Run up in yo shit just

"Children are our future because when I am old they will be the ones who are caring for me, so for me censorship is big deal for me. It's a big deal not only because of how it will affect my children, but because it will affect me and what everybody else will be able to read. I agree that censorship is an importaint issue but to what extent should it be taken. People should have the right to read what they want to. They should also be allowed to find it in their local public libraries.     My veiw on censorship in public libraries is that most things should be allowed to stay on the book shelf. I can understand censorship to an extent, but taking books out of a public libraries makes it hard to chose where to draw the line. You don't want a book taken out just because it has a bad word in it. Just because some books are classics that everyone knows, does that mean that we shouldn't take that book out of a public library? I do beleive that some books should stay because adults don't want to be reading kids books they most likely want to be reading a more complex book.      I think their are some books that should stay out of the library though. A example is books that are extremly racist. These books should be kept far away from are children. This is needed because younger children might try to act out things they might hear or read because there are audio books and those would just make them say those things. This could cause them to get in trouble for things they don't understand yet.     There is things that you can do as an alterative to keep these things out of the hands of children. There is already one that is used in public libraries and it is seperateing the adutl books from the children books. You could also move these two sections to oppisite sides of the library. the books that are more explicit cold be put higher up such as on a top shelf. Most kids would not be able to reach as high as a adult.     These are my veiws and ideas on censorship in libraries. The ideas and veiws that I have are most likely different than most people. I thought that they were good ideas though. Ones such as seperate section for kids and adults. I thought my best one was puting the more explicit books up higher and moving the sections farther a part..Don't start to fumble it up   Just do it   Go, go   Don't wanna know about vacations in this

"Books, music, movies, and magazines are all a form of expression. We have the freedom to @ORGANIZATION1 the way we feel or think, but can it be to graphic for some to read? I believe censorship in libraries are needed to protect the minds of children and people who are easily influenced by the thoughts of others.     Books are a major factor in expressing the way one feels about a topic from romance to horror. Many children like to read books or comic books that invovle a great deal of violence. Childrens mind's are like sponges, which means they soke up anything they read about and it has a great chance at influencing their functioning to everyday activities.      If you go into a music store you will find many different types of music from rap to blue grass. I've noticed in my school that a particular type of music that stands out is rap and the favorite artist is @ORGANIZATION2 @PERSON1. @ORGANIZATION2 @PERSON1 has been known for rapping about drugs, sex, money, and violence. Many teens think that if their favorite artist can do all this why can't they? I've only listened to a few songs by @ORGANIZATION2 and in every song one of those four key topics comes up.      Like @ORGANIZATION2 @PERSON1 the movie industry is starting to come out with more and more movies about drugs, sex, money, and violence. Many students in my school talk about the latest comedy movies like '@ORGANIZATION1', 'The @CAPS1', '@CAPS2' ect. and how they turned their life into something like those movies when they go on @DATE1 or @DATE2 break. Movies like those are funny to watch but for someone who is easily influenced shouldn't be watching them.     Books, music, movies, and magazines, they surround us with their stories and thoughts of another human being. We do have the freedom and the right to @ORGANIZATION1 ourselves but we also have the right to take it away if we feel it is endangering the minds of others. I think censorship in a library from certain things is a good option in cleaning up a mind poisoning mess.Angels watching over me, every step I take,   Angels watching over me      Angels watching over me   Angels watching over me      Got his angels watching over me, every move I make,   Angels watching over me!.The general is sat and the lines on the map   Move from side to side..[See ya   Keep it going and keep it ringing out, let it ring out   Hey, doc   Okay, turn it off now].It was always so easy to find and unhappy woman   Till I started looking for mine   Some beer drinking devil is holding my angel   And I know what he'll do if he's my kind   It was always so easy to find an unhappy woman   Till I started looking for mine.I've taken it now, the procardia, just yet..Jump on a cloud and we'll float to and fro..Shawty, whatchu doin' tonight?.First you say you're in love with me and that it lasts eternally..I'm King Kong, I got so much money,   I can buy anybody who gets in my path..What are these crazy questions   That they're asking of me?.Sat out a card game in a motel room   Don't let the muzak drive you crazy late at night   They tell me it's all part of the deal I'm in   Well I close my eyes, put memory into sight   Every time I see you smile   Now the lady tabs your case, leaves you thinking   An hour or so: I hope she's right on time   And you dream away your touchdown destination   Now single file and put yourself back in line   But oh, every time I see you smile   Now this old world don't give much for choosing   You can spend a lifetime driving yourself wild   But I can take it's punches laughing -

"Do you find books you read offensive?  How about music, or magazines?  I sure don't.  I can't think of why someone would be offended about a book they chose to read.  If you sit back and think about it, there should be a low amout of reasons that someone should be offended by a book that is written for the general public.       I believe that it is possible for there to be books that have offensive words or actions in them, but unless they are directed towards the reader, or intentionally being used to offend someone then it is just a book.  A lot of books, especially ones on history, use language and actions that were used during that time.  They use them to show you and inform you on how things used to be and what it was like during the time.  Not very often, or that I have ever seen, do the authors make a book to just to put someone down.  I tend to see books just explaining things and using offensive words just to show how things were and to set a tone of the book.     Music on the other hand could be thought of as different.  Many people could take music in the wrong way.  A majority of offensive problems spawning from music come from the genre of rap.  Rappers tend to express themselves throughly, and in doing that often times use very offensive language.  I personally don't get botherd by the music, because they are usually refering to their own life and how things went with them.  Music can also be on the good side too.  When you get the calm and collective music, it tends to help people and can be used to help people relax.  Therefore music can be either way, but it mostly goes about who the person is and how they react to what they listen to.     Then you have magazines.  Personally I think they are the worst of all.  Magazines tend to go one way or the other.  They either put a person down and be completely negative towards them, or they are positive and say nothing but good about them.  One big problem with magazines is that they write down what they hear and what they want to hear, not always knowing the full story.  In that case they have a very high chance of being very offensive towards the person or group they are talking about.  Magazines always have a positive, but where there is a positive they have a harsh negative thing to put in with it.       In these regaurds, I believe that there is nothing wrong with a library.  There are always going to be negatives and positives, but libraries tend to stick with the positive side.  Plus if a book looks like it might end up being offensive towards you, then there is no one that can tell you that you can't just put it down and stop reading it.  With music, only get stuff that you like and if you are easily offended don't listen to that music.  Libraries just give you the opportunity to possibly get something you could enjoy.  There is no reason someone would not be able to refrain from going in and getting an offensive book. In saying this, it can go either way.  I don't believe there is anything worng with libraries censorship as long as you can use your own good judgement..Have you ever been mistreated?.My warning meant nothing..Francis!.I want   Just stay in   I want to make love      And if the bottle's no solution   Why does it feel so warm   And if looking back is no solution   Why are we all just children inside   And if to feel is no solution

"I do not believe that these types of books should be taken off of the shelves. Everybody has their likes and dislikes with music, books, movies, magazines, etc. If the reader does not like the book, then the reader will not continue reading the book. If the listener does not enjoy rap music, then they will stop listening and try to find a different kind of music. This topic is about personal opinion and choice. If it was me, then I would say yes to allowing censored materials. I like getting the full effect out of things. I wanna hear the rawness of a song or the anger of a character in a book. I don't want to read and see a bunch of little stars on a censored word. I want to see that word and feel its full effect.          I am actually reading the very controversial book '@CAPS1 of @ORGANIZATION1'. As you @MONTH1 know the author of this book is named @PERSON1. Another thing you @MONTH1 know is the use of the '@CAPS2-word'. This is a very controversial book because he doesn't call colored people black or colored, he calls them the '@CAPS2-word' throughout most of the book. Most people now think this is very racist. But back in @LOCATION1's time it was very commonly said and used in his society. It wasn't racist back in that time, I mean it still was but it wasn't as controversial as it is today. Now critics and some readers don't agree with this term and think the book should not be held in libraries or read at all for that fact. I have to disagree though. I understand why he used the word, it was a common word in his time. If you take that word away from the book, you lose some history of the old south.     People have the freedom of speech to say whatever they want to say, whether that be in written form or verbally said. I honestly say some of these censored words. Most of the time these words are said when I am angry at myself or another person. People can't control what we say, so why should they be able to control what we write or sing? Just a thought. Saying that, on the other hand I can see why people don't want these censored words. Maybe they just don't want their little kid to say a censored word in class to the teacher or to another classmate. That's understandable, but you can't protect your kids from censored words. They are everywhere. From video games, to movies, and even most books now. You cannot control what other people do or say. It is their freedom to do whatever they want..More!.Watch out boy, (watch out boy)   Shuffle to the beat,   Gonna take a cut,   There's money in your feet,   Gonna stitch you up..It's all mine....I can see hills touch the sky   Heaven and earth, you and I   A world we will always be   Here in the silence we lie   Shadows we cast, you and I   Speak for eternity      [Chorus]   Pressed between pages   Flowers will die   Stories may end as time passes by   You and I will always be      With every word that I hear   Whenever whispers are near   I can believe in fate   Promises made, only one      Yesterday fades from the sun   And falls to a new embrace   Years overflow   As rivers run dry      Here in a moment of time passing by   You and I will always be, will always be      [Chorus].This road will never take me out, I've been stopped in   My tracks..Don't jump!"".Oh!.She's him, too..It was about five til' five on Friday   We were all getting ready to go   And the boss man started screaming   And his veins began to show   He said ""You and you come with me   'Cause you're gonna have to stay""   My heart was thumping I was jumping   I had to get away      [Chorus]   Some days you gotta dance   Live it up when you get the chacne   When the world doesn't make no sense   And you're feeling just a little too tense   Gotta loosen up those chains and dance      Well I was talking with my baby   Over a small glass of tea   When she asked a loaded question   She said ""How do you feel about me?"".Well I've been lying awake all night just thinking of you   But a bottle of whiskey lies heavy obstructing my view   I've got a bottle of pills to give me my thrills   And I know that I'm leading a life that kills      (Wasted) I've wasted my time   (Wasted) I'm shooting a line   (Wasted) I'm stuck in a hole   (Wasted) I'm losing control      And I've been meaning to call, I've been wanting to phone   You see I don't like the thought of leaving you here alone   Well I've seen things down here that are fit for a queen   I've seen things down here that should never be seen      (Wasted) I've wasted my money   (Wasted) I've wasted you honey   (Wasted) I'm out of my brain   (Wasted) I'm going insane      I'm running in thin air   There's nothingness everywhere   I've gotta get out   (Won't you help me?).(Yeah)      I saw this coming   From a mile away   I saw a crack   In the egg   A little rip   In the page      I found   Your necklace   On the floor   Underneath the bed   Where you said   I was the only one      You thought I'd cry   (You-thought-i'd-cry)   You thought I'd lay   Down and die   You thought   There's no   Hetting over you   (Ha-ha)      And all this time   (All-this-time)   You've been having   Your fun   I've been having   Some fun too      Cause' it   Takes one to know one   Congrats   You've met your match   You think I'd lie here   Heartbroken   But the knife   Is in your back   (In-your-back)      You left your suit   You left your tie   And looked me in the eye   And swore that it   Was business baby   (Yeah right)      And when you left   I got a call   That started it all   And now   It's not your business   Ba-by      You thought I'd cry   (You-thought-i'd-cry)   You thought I'd lay   Down and die   You thought   There's no   Getting over you   (Ha-ha)      But all this time   (All-this-time)   You've been having   Your fun   I've been having   Some fun too      Cause' it   Takes one to know one   Congrats   You've met your match   You think I'd lie here   Heartbroken   (I'd-lie-here)   But the knife   Is in your back   (In-your-back)      You're such a wreck   The cutest accident   Makes so much sense   You'll come   Back to me   Oh   (Ahhhh)      And I'll let you      Hey   Huh   You're back      Cause' it takes one   To know one   Congrats   You've met your match   You think   I'd lie here   Heartbroken   (I'd-lie-here)   But the knife   Is in you're back   (In-your-back)      Cause' it   Takes one to know one   (Hi, nice to meet you)   Congrats   You've met your match   You think   I'd lie here   Heartbroken   (I'll-lie-here)   But the knife   Is in your back   (In-your-back).Trying to see what else at this instant   What do you call it   Instant rock   Eagle in flight   Black Hawk four   Whatever it is   Going back to cloud nine   Just more volume      The weekend...

"Imagine a world where nearly every other book is banned for some reason or another. That world is not a world I want to live in. I believe that censorship in libraries is wrong. For three reasons, really, the first being that people have the right to any information that they desire to have. The second, people do not have the power to take opportunities away from other people. The last point I will make is that no information is bad information.     Because we are in @LOCATION1, I asume that we are talking about censorship in @CAPS1 libraries. If that is the case, then I think that it is unconstituitional to ban any book, or censor any material. Censoring books is like putting a blind fold on whoever is reading the material; they don't see it for what it really is, or for what the intended purpose is.     If the prompt does happen to be including foreign countries, then I think humans do not have the right to influence what other people read. This is idealistic, yes, and in a perfect world, all countires would have equal rights for everyone, regardless of race or gender. I think that people should see everything the way it is. If something is offensive, it's offensive. It's the person's choice whether or not they read or listen.     That leads me to my last point, that no information can be bad information. Whether it is profane, or offensive in any way, there is always some kind of meaning behind it. From rappers like @PERSON2 and @CAPS2 @CAPS3, who I've found all of their songs have meaning, whether it's personal, or they are trying to send a message out to the people. There are books like @CAPS4 for @LOCATION2, by @ORGANIZATION1, which has recently been banned by some school libraries because of graphic scenes. The people who banned the book fail to realize that the book is not about those scenes. There is a much deeper message about guilt and grief, and redemption beneath it. Another, more famous book that was banned from school libraries is The @CAPS5 in the @CAPS6, by @PERSON1, which is a coming of age story about a boy.      In conclusion, I don not think it is right to ban books or music from libraries. No one has the right to.There is always meaning within. The way an author writes a story or a piece of music always has meaning; they made the conscious decision to write it that way for a reason. By banning books, they are taking people's chances to grow and expand..I'm a very special V.I.P""      Another interesting phenomenon, associated with V.I.P celebrity hood,   Is the ""V.I.P reflection

"The last thing I would want my children seeing in a @CAPS1 is offensive material. a @CAPS1 is thought of as a learning zone. Somewhere for people to learn about new things and expand their knowldge. If there are dirty magazines, movies on sexuality, offensive music or inappropriate websites available to children it completely defeats the purpose of having a safe learning enviornment.      My opinion is that libraries should be used primarily for educational purposes. That means that there should be appropriate books and magazines that are also age appropriate. Computers are also a great resource but can contain many offensive material. My standpoint on this issue is that the computers in the @CAPS1 should be monitored. If someone wants to look up inappropraite images and websites, then they should do it on their own time, in the privacy of their own home. It should not be allowed in public where innocent children will be exposed to it. That isn't fair to the kids, and it isn't fair to the parents who have tried to protect them from that kind of suggestive material.     I'm sure that there are many people out there that would disagree with my proposal. However those @MONTH1 be the type of people who aren't morally structured as I, or those who don't have kids to look out for. Or perhaps they just aren't as concerned about the issue. They will argue that there is really no severe need for the computers to be monitored, or that they have blocked websites. Yes, they @MONTH1 think that there is no real harm. But that @MONTH1 just be because that is the way they were raised, causing them to think in that same respect. With the magazines, some @MONTH1 argue that children will be exposed to suggestive material sometime, so why not now? But if everyone were to start thinking like this all morals would be forgotten.      In some cases morality might not be the issue at all. In fact, religion might be the most important issue. A lot of people are religious and their particular religion @MONTH1 be against looking at suggestive and 'unholy' material. Parents will not want to walk into a @CAPS1 with their children and find them starting at images that go against what they believe in. They will think of it as losing their child's innocense. Having these things out in the open and accessable to kids and teenagers could unintentionally send a message to them that indulging in sexual activities is acceptable when according to their religion it is not.     When I was a little girl I remember going to the @CAPS1 often with my mother to pick out books for school. I distinctly remember seeing naughty magazines laying across a table as I was walking toward the children's section. My mother was appauled that they had those laying out in the open like that, and especially right next to where the children's books were. She complained to one of the librarians and asked that they please remove them. The librarian apologized and agreed that the placement of the magazines was a little out of line. Ever since then my mom has been a little sceptical and dreads going to that @CAPS1. I suppose that is why I am so involved in this issue and the reason for this informative article.     I did not write this to place blame on anyone or to judge people for their beliefs. On the contrary, the purpose for my writing this was to inform general public of these issues and to explain my side of the arguement. I don't see the reason of having these materials on hand at a @CAPS1 where almost anyone has access to them. I do not understand the need for them to be obtainable at a @CAPS1, or if there is a need at all. I'm hoping that by reading this I have opened the eyes of some concerned parents out there, or have at least made them aware of the matter. Thank you for your time.

"How would you like it if someone took a book away from you, just because it had @CAPS1 language or nasty meaning? I mean of course there are certain books that should be censored, but in doing so you exclude @CAPS1 great novels from the past. These novels were acceptable back then. If you want to censor boks do so in your own library.     Personaly, I don't believe in the censorship of books. It the author meant to write the book that way then the writing should stay that exact way. Censoring destroys books and the learning curriculum of multiple students. You would censor a school book if it had @CAPS1 graphic text between its covers.     There are tons of books that have bad language and perverse ideas. These books were penned to educate our civilization. If you take away those books, then you will be harming our societies ability to learn. Books, I believe should not be offensive unless your a self-conscious person. Reading a book is a delightful experience, it shouldn't be marred by censorships.      In my personal experience, I have had no problem reading a exquisit novel that has @CAPS1 minor graphic details. I do not care if there is a explicit word in my reading. Albeit, @CAPS1 neive persons have it in there will to remove offensive articles, not for public good, but for personal gain. These offensive tactics are a disgrace to literature and culture. @CAPS1 of the books writen in today's world are far less explicit then before. Thus, we would be creating that unwanted barrier.     When the @CAPS2 @CAPS3 burned the @CAPS4 books, we almost lost a whole civilizations culture and literature. This should never happen to today's literature. If we censor the books in our libraries, then we will be loosing a certain aspect of our culture. The censorship of the articles of reading in our libraries should be kept to personal libraries and only to personal libraries. The libraries are public for a reason.      In conclusion, Censorship should not be placed in libraries because it disrupts the public literature. If the books were meant to be read that way, then so be it. We are not the destroyer of classic literature, and it should never come to that..Oh what the hell   It doesn't really matter   How do you redefine something that never really had a name?.Kim, come

once, we ain't got it anymore""   She packed her bags, left me behind   She bought a ticket on the Central Line   Nights as I sleep, I hear that whistle whining   I feel her kiss in the misty rain   And I feel like I'm a rider on a downbound train      Last night I heard your voice   You were crying, crying, you were so alone   You said your love had never died   You were waiting for me at home   Put on my jacket, I ran through the woods   I ran till I thought my chest would explode   There in the clearing, beyond the highway   In the moonlight, our wedding house shone   I rushed through the yard   I burst through the front door, my head pounding hard   Up the stairs I climbed   The room was dark, our bed was empty   Then I heard that long whistle whine   And I dropped to my knees, hung my head and cried   Now I swing a sledge hammer on a railroad gang   Knocking down them cross ties, working in the rain   Now, don't it feel like you're a rider on a downbound train.That is the

"I do not belive that they should be takein off the shelfs beacuse @CAPS1 people still come to get that sort of stuff. @CAPS1 people say is not plite for little kids 'well keek your kids away from it then.'             @CAPS1 people dont like it and @CAPS1 people do. I am one of the people that like that kind of stuff, beacuse no one can tell us what we can and cant watch or say. It is our life if we wanna watch that kind of stuff or read about it we can.            Noone is telling people that they half to read it or even look at it. If you dont like it dont look at it. @CAPS2 kind of stuff should be off to the side where you know what your goin to look at and away from kids                       @CAPS2 shouldnt even be a problem. @CAPS2 is just people that think they are high class and think if you look at that or watch that or read that you are a dirt bag. That is there opinon.             In conclusion  I think if you dont read @CAPS2 stuff or watch @CAPS2 stuff you are trying to be something you are not. Trying to act better than every cause your to high class to read something like that.

"In my opinion, books that @MONTH1 seem offensive to someone should be kept on the shelf. Meaning that people should be allowed to check them out in the library and read them even if some people think those books in particular are offensive, or @MONTH1 come off as offensive.      A person should be able to read an article without feeling like somone wrote that book, article, or magazine to be offensive. Yes, but at the same time it is up to you, the reader, to pick a book that does and will not make you feel uncomfortable. Do not pick a book to read that discriminates against football players if you are a football player, because most likely it is going to upset you, or make you uncomfortable. Well say you want to read a book that discriminates against football players, and it does make you feel uncomfortable, do not take the book, and go complain to someone about how the book, or article makes you feel if you picked it out to begin with. If it makes you uncomfortable, put the book, or article down. No one is forcing you to read it or look at it.      People should be allowed to read whatever type of books they would like, and about anything that interests them. Just because an article, or book is offensive to you, does not mean it is offensive to other people. If we were to take all the books, articles, magazines off the shelfs of library's there would not be any books left for us to read because every book written offends at least one person.      Movies are a whole other issue in itself. There are many types of movies, and within those types of movies are types of things people do in the movies to make it funny, scary, shocking, stupid, etc. If you do not cuss and say you go watch '@CAPS1 @CAPS2' you are going to find it offensive because every other word they say is a cuss word. If you do not like @CAPS4 people jump out of strange places and scare the crap out of you, then you are not going to watch '@CAPS3.' @CAPS4 people find movies offensive or not to their liking the usually go and try to make a big deal out of it, and sue the people who made the movie. You doing that is causing more trouble than it is actually worth. The same thing with movies as books, if we were to take all the movies out of movie stores, and just stores in general that were offensive to at least one person in any way, we would not have any movies left to watch because at the end of the day; there are tons of movies that would offend some people, and make them uncomfortable.      In conclusion, if you find a movie, song, book, article, or magazine that is offensive to you, get over it. Keep that book or whatever it is out of your reach and in other peoples, because at the end of the day no one is going to help you sue an author, producer, or music production company because something they wrote, directed, or sung offends you. In my opinion you should just read what interests you, watch what you like, and listen to the songs you usually listen to.Though it never made The New York Times..[Rap by Knowdaverbs:]   I remember begging my mom for these Z.

"Should books,music,magazines, etc., be removed form shelves that are found offensive? Everyone has their own oppion on that question. In my years of reading I have read a few books that were questionable. I wouldn't say someone else couldn't relate to it.      Personaly i don't think anything should be removed from the shelves. While growning up our parents try to keep us from things, at that point in life don't need to see. I can agree with age limit but you can't hide everything. Isn't it best to let the children know whats out there before you just letting them go to find out on there own?     You would probably get multiple answers to that question. My personal views @MONTH1 be different from the person sitting bestide me, but I think you should be able to have the right to read, see, and litsen to what you want. The world is not a safe place, its scary and mean to the people. When I raise my children, when they're younger there will be certin things that they wont know and wont see. But thats just part of raising your kids, when they get older and start asking quesions i'm going to answer with the truth.     Is keeping these things from our children lying to them? I would have to say yes to that question. By taking these things away from the youth we are telling them that its not out there, that the world is perfect and there is no wrong. Some people would actually say that, but I have to say to them that they haven't lived. Still to this day there is segregation to all people not just against races but in our own race itself.     To conclude my oppion I would have to say that we should be free to read and see what we want. We shouldn't, not let anyone see it and them and then let them out in the world, and have a complete culture shock. Teach your children whats out there, let them know the truth about the world. Should certain materials be removed from shelves? No, @CAPS1 is to judge what we see and hear?.When you fall into your seat   You know you feel you might be dying   As the breath rasps in and out   Of your burning throat   You can't control your lungs because you're so tired   You're half awake with one arm in your coat   Well thank god that there is someone there to drive you   You know you couldn't make it on your own   He helps you through the door   You sit down on the floor   And you're asleep before you are alone      [Chorus: x2]   Your life is like a schedule   You run to meet the bills   No one's awake to tell you   Life kills      For a while it seems exhaustion has subsided   The day is over and the moon is high   But your period of work is predecided   Funny how the hours of freedom seem to fly   Well thank god that there is someone there to drive you   You know you couldn't make it on your own   He helps you in the door   You sit down as before   Another shift to pay another loan      [Chorus: x4].Do you?.Let's go in..Nu-mi raspunzi la SMS...

love me.Late night calls, I bet you do it all   Anything to get it off but you still persist to front on me   Baby tell me      Why do we play this game of chase   When you know we both feel the same

stand   Here on the beach   And I'm tolling my bell   In the fog to let you know   I'm here by your side   In this madness called life   Though the knights have all gone   And we lowered our flags   I sing you this song as the tides wash the sands   On the beach   Take my hand like I once took yours   Look me in the eye like I once looked in yours   Here we go again, speaking in strange codes   Reading all the stars   Like an open book   On the beach.Across the evening sky   All the birds are leaving   But how can they know   It's time for them to go?.You know I can't stand to be alone..On and on and on   Keep on rocking baby   'Til the night is gone      Over in the corner   I could see this other guy   He was kinda flirty   He was giving me the eye   So I took advantage   Of the fact that I'm a star   Shook my hair and took   A casual stroll up to the bar   And as sure as hell   This guy was coming up to me   He said, who am I and   Who are you and who are we   What's our situation do   We have some time for us?.Three hours from sundown   Jeremy flies   Hoping to keep   The sun from his eyes   East from the city   And down to the cave   In search of a master   In

way      He thinks he's educated, airs those family shares   Will protect him that we will respect him   He moves in circles of friends   Who just pretend that they like him   He does the same to them, and when you put it all together   There's the model of a charmless man      He knows the swingers and their cavalry   Says he can get in anywhere for free   I began to go a little cross eyed   And from this charmless man I just had to hide      He talks at speed he gets nosebleeds   He doesn't see his days   Are tumbling down upon him   And yet he tries so hard to please   He's just so keen for you to listen   But no one is listening   And when you put it all together   There's the model of a charmless man"
"Do I believe that certain materials, such as books, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive?  I understand that some parents wouldn't want their kids reading a book about drugs or watching a movie about gangs, but libraries shouldn't have to remove them from their shelves.  There is not one movie, book, or magazine where everyone will approve of it.  Just because a couple of people find it offensive doesn't mean they should have the power to determine what materials libraries have or don't have on their shelves.       One reason why I believe certain items shouldn't be removed from a library just because a couple of people find it offensive is because what Katherine Paterson said in her quote.  She is saying if there was a book a couple of parents didn't want their kids to see and they were to complain and have the right to remove it from the libraries shelf.  Then sooner or later, more and more parents will be coming in complaining about a different book, movie, or magazine every other day.  Soon, there wouldn't be any books, movies, magazines in the library.       Another reason why I believe we should have no say in what items libraries hold is this.  As you know, there is many different cultural familes living in the @LOCATION1.  Some people say bibles should be allowed in libraries.  Half the population agrees on that statement, the other half thinks that is ridiculous and they're thinking how they would even suggest doing such a thing.  How would a library handle this situation.  If we gave people the right to decide what was held in libraries.  There would be a group of people walking in there and saying they don't believe in @CAPS1 so they must take those bibles off the shelf before their children read it.  Then, as soon as the believers in @CAPS1 hear about it.  They would come to that library and complain about them actually taking that off the shelves.  There would be no way in pleasing everyone, so the libraries should be able to put whatever they want on their shelves.       My third and final reason why I think the public should have no say in this matter is if libraries were forced to take items off their shelves just because a couple people complain about certain books or movies.  Then why couldn't people do that at restaurants, or movie rental business, or outlet stores with clothes they don't approve.  If it was to happen to one business, then it should happen to every business and in my perspective.  The only person who should have the say in what they have in their store/library is the person who is paying for it and that is the owner.  It's their responsibility to know what's too far concerning movies or books, etc.  The public has to accept those choices.  You have to look at it from their view.  Would you want them to come into your business and start complaining and then you are forced to get rid of that item because of them.  It's just not the right way to handle things.     After reading all those opinions of mine, I would hope that you see where I'm coming from and you see that it just wouldn't be humane to do that.  It's never been that way and it should never be that way.  Obviously parents don't want their kids to see things inappropiate.  But it's not our say and we just have to face the fact that's the way it should be.'Cause mi have mi weed and,   Mi a look seven dollar coin..Don't shoot no game that game is shoot   'Cause girl I know it,   You wanna dance just turn around and...

"Today, we live in a world where there are many different political, religious and personal views; and with time, these views are only going to become more varied and more wide spread. Unfortunately, it is not always easy to cater to every single persons individual takes on the world. When it comes to libraries, it is even harder to have different books for all the different opinions that will not offend people with other opinions.    Let's take @LOCATION1 for example. There are many different races and people with different religions living here. This is a place that has already been through a @CAPS1 @CAPS2 and has fought against racism and slavery. Although these are things that our country has overcome, there are still going to be arguments and disagreements over these problems. When there are different opinions, there are always going to be different books out there about the same topic from multiple points of view. As the readers of these books we need to know what point of view this is coming from and not choose a book that goes against our personal beliefs. This is where the offensiveness comes from. We live with many different people and we need to understand that not everyone is going to have the same views on life that we do.      When I was in eighth grade, I was @CAPS6 @ORGANIZATION1 with some friends. One of them was pulling her eyes back (like someone would do if they were imitating an @CAPS3 person) because they were itchy. A very pregnant @CAPS3 @CAPS5 woman walked in and took offense to my friends eye movements. She yelled @CAPS6 us and said, 'I would have thought your parents raised you better than that.' @CAPS6 first, we did not understand what this woman was talking about until we realized that our friend had been pulling her eyes back. This showed us that different people can take offense to different things because of their heritage.     There is nothing we can do about the expanding cultures in our country. We cannot change the views of certain people in order to match those of our own beliefs nor can we change the fact that all the different people are going to voice their opinions and view them as 'right'. However, we can change the way that we view these people. We need to understand that there is no 'right' when you are dealing with multiple opinions. @CAPS6 this point we need to embrace everyone else for who they are and what they believe because there is nothing we can do to change those beliefs.     So next time you pick up a book @CAPS6 the library, read the summary and check to see that the author agrees with you before you take the book home or there are going to be disagreements in your views. If you get a book and you don't agree with it or if you are offended by it, there is no one to be mad @CAPS6 but yourself for not checking to see the author's stance on the topic before you started reading it.Darlin' I don't know much..You said you didn't know   That the cats with the birds were there   And you never go along with that kind of stuff no where   But that just isn't the point man   That's the wrong wrong way to go   If you didn't know about that one, well then what else don't you know   You said that you were lied to   Well that ain't hard too see   But you must have been fooled again by your friends across the sea   And maybe you were fooled again by your people here at home   Because nobody could talk like you   And know what's going on   Nobody elected your family   And we didn't elect your friends   No one voted for your advisers   And nobody wants the men   You're the one we voted for, so you must take the blame   For handing out authority to men who were insane   You say its all fixed up now, you've got new guys on the line   But you had better remember this while you still got the time   Mothers still are weeping for their boys that went to war   Father still are

"Have you ever seen a book or magazine on a shelf that looked offensive? Say, maybe some sort of book that highly deals with drugs, alcohol or even sex? Well, some parents don't want their kids to 'accidently' pick up this book and read it. It could scar them mentally for life.      Offensive books are not meant for kids or even some kids in the early teens. They are too young to learn about drugs, alcohol and/or sex. If a kid picks up a book about sex, which I highly doubt would be on a library shelf, what would they say to their parents? '@CAPS1, look what I found.' is exactly what the kid would say and show the book to their parent. The parent, in shock, could sue the library for having such an offensive book.      However, some @CAPS2 do not find books like that on library shelves offensive. It might 'provide' good information for their lives or even someone else's life. @CAPS2 are the ones who should be reading those kinds of books, not their children. It can and will mentally scar them for life.       The library could do simple things, like for example: they could make a room just for @CAPS2 and have the offensive movies/books/magazines, ect in there. Kids can't enter unless they are @NUM1 or older. That could be a good idea because their children wouldn't be picking up those kinds of offensive books and it will keep their mind safer.      Us children are always curious to know things, especially when we are growing up. We'll ask about drugs, alcohol and even sex when the time is right. But for the library to have things like that on their shelves is just very offensive to parents and other @CAPS2. The library staff should take action and make a separate room for @CAPS2 @CAPS3.We've laid the cables and the wires   We've split the wood and stoked the fires   We've lit our town so there is no

"Books in libraries are available to everyone, so who's job is it to decide which ones are appropriate and which are not? This is a very controversial topic. On one side, parents are worried about what their children have access to at local libraries. They believe libraries shouldn't contain any books that might be found offensive. On the other hand, whose job is it to decide what is offensive and what is not? If people are given the right to remove books that they think are not appropriate, eventually libraries will have so few books that it would be worthless to even get a library card.     I believe that it is the job of parents and other adults to teach a child morals and what is right and wrong. If kids have developed morals and values, parents wouldn't have to worry so much about what they're checking out of the local library. Kids are faced with issues of right and wrong everyday, and parents should learn to trust that their child is making the right decision.     As a teenager, I know that people have access to far worse things on the internet than in libraries. If people begin to censor libraries, surely they will begin to censor the internet, and the idea of freedom of speech will be thrown out the window. People have a right to be heard and share their opinions, and who has the right to say that a person's opinion doesn't matter? In my opinion, the act of removing books from a library says just that.      Just a few months ago I had to write a research paper about the @PERSON1, and in order to find information about the topic, I had to check out books from the library. Some of the information I read about the topic was horrible and very offensive, but I couldn't have written my paper without it. Books in libraries have information that is vital, whether the books are offensive or not. Books can be used to teach people lessons on what is right or wrong. By being educated about even the most offensive things, people can learn from them and form their beliefs. Removing offensive books from libraries will not lessen the chance that someone's child will run across the information that they contain. There are many sources for information, offensive or not, and a library is just one of them.      People are responsible for their decisions, and it is each individual's choice on what they choose to read, watch, or listen to. We are faced with choices everyday. Should we watch a movie even though we know it's inappropriate? Should we listen to a song even though it gives off a bad message? Checking out a book from the library requires the same decision. Each person must choose what is right, and it is not our job to tell others what they can and can't do..Why can't we take this slow?.(scat singing)      They don't know   Nobody knows   They don't know   Just don't know   Da da da....Wich bone   In her body should I break first?.Yeah!.I beg your pardon momma   What did you say?.Yo, yo, you my hero..'Cause when it gets to midnight, I don't know who I am..Oh, baby baby baby..I can't take any more..I missed you so, so bad   Before you came into my life I missed you so bad   And you should know that....All I want is the way it used to be   I need you here with me..Help me, darling,   Help me, please!.You never looked so good   As you did last night   Underneath the city lights   There, walking with your friend   Laughing at the moon   I swear you looked right through me      But I'm still living with your goodbye   And you're just going on with your life      How can you just walk on by   Without one tear in your eye?.It makes me feel strangely alive."".Strange how I still feel   My loss of comfort gone before..Feel like I'm a million, million,   Feel like I'm a million miles away..So shut up, and come on,   Sing our song..In fields they've never seen before   Far from fields they'll never see again.Monsters!.Come on baby, let me take you by the hand   Come on sugar, let me take you by the hand   Go for me, let me be,   All your own candy, your candy, candy man      Come on baby, I love your honey lovin' ways   Baby sweet thing, I love your honey lovin', your honey lovin' ways   Come to me, let me be   All your own candy, your candy, candy man      Come on woman, gonna treat you right   Give you candy kisses every single night      Candy man, candy man, candy man, candy man,   Go for me, let me be   All your own candy, your candy, candy man..Is this love?.Woah   What's new pussycat?"
"'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf-that work I abhor- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' wrote by Katherine Paterson. If you think about it when you go into a library there is a ton of books to choose from. But how many do you think is appropiate for every age and including children, not very many. That is why they have sections for the books, but there are times people are rude and mix them up on purpose.          How many times have you been in a library and find a misplaced book? Many of times right, that can be accidental or on purpose. I know if I took my child or children to a libraby and they got a book that was inappropiate for them, I would take it to the front desk and complain about that book. Now if it was a book that has been misplaced I would take it from them. But, yes there are some books, magazines, movies, and music that should be removed from the libray.      I remember from when I was a little girl going into the library to check out books with my mom or my dad, it did not matter they both enjoyed taking me to the library. They were pleased that I loved to read but, one day my mom took me to get books from the library, she did not think about looking at the books I got until we got home and she realized on of my books had a cursing word in it. She was not happy at all, I had no clue what she was doing. But I figured it out, she grabbed me by my hand and took me to the car. She fastened me in and off we went, back to the library. She had no problem going off and complaining, I can remember her every word she said it sounded like this. '@CAPS1, my name is @LOCATION2 and this is my daughter @PERSON2 she is six years old. We were just her about an hour ago, but you want to know the funny reason we are back. Well if you can give me a funny reason for why my six year old daughter has a childs book from here with cursing in it. Please speak up and explain I would love to hear it.' The lady at the front desk was stunned she has never had someone go off on her for the seven years she had worked there. But the book is no longer in the @LOCATION1 library, I can not remember the title of this book, I just know that with a mom like mine she can get something done.   Just like Katherine Paterson said, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf- that work I abhor- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' I can tell you from experience and observation, you can do and get what ever you want with a little power and persausion.

"Books, music, movies, magazines, ect. should be remove if they are offensive to a race or any other kinds of belifs unless they are biogical or historical time line.  If the reading material is so offensive towards you or your belifs, you @MONTH1 want to see a libarian and tell what you think about so that the reading material will be remove off the sevles and gone.     I think that if it goes against something in a bad way is should be removed and gone.  I've read a magazine before and it had some offensive stuff.  I went to the libarian, told her that i wanted this magazine off the shelves.  We argued for about five minutes and finally the magazine was off the shelves.       Nobody wants something to go against them in anyway.  Thats way we should have offensive material off our libaries shelves..I'm going home, I'm going home,   I'm going home on morning train..I'm gonna call up the gypsy woman on my telephone   I'm gonna tell the world wide who doo..Secret staircase, running low,   But they all know, now you're inside..""The   Soundtrack to a Generation""..Shrouding all the ground around me   Is this holy crow above me..Uh-huh,   Where shall the wedding supper be?.I'm so happy with what I got, I want more!.Stories are smoke trails   And some may be true..They're taking me slow   One way ticket to   Death row.You know I'm not the same!.While people eat their biscuits with tea,   They dream of daffodils that sway in the breeze..You're never gonna be content if you font try,   Try to see outside your line..If it did it never made a sound,   Maybe I was absent or was listening to fast,   Catching all the words, but then the meaning going past,      But God I miss the girl,   And I'd go a thousand times around the world just to be   Closer to her than to me..If you find yourself looking for someone   To make good the bad things that you've done   Now do you think you're looking straight ahead   And will you find the answer when you're dead      Well then you should listen now to me   And I'll tell you how I think it should be   No one tells you why you're here to live   And this is why it's you who must forgive      No!.I am a mirror..I am tired of you telling me what I ought to do   Stickin' your nose in my business and it don't concern you   It's my own business, it's my own business   Seems like the ones that want to tell you   They don't ever know as much as you   If I go buy a Cadillac convertible coupe   And all I got at home to eat is just onion soup   It's my own business, it's my own business   If I would rather ride around   In my own Cadillac convertible coupe   If I's a dignatary on Capitol Hill   And up and married me a waitress in a hot dog grill   It's my own business, it's my own business   Because I am not a juvenile   And I can go out at my own free wil   After workin' on my job and then drawin' my pay   If I want to go out and have a ball and throw it all away   It's my own business, it's my own business   'Cause I don't wait until tomorrow   To do something I could do today.With your big eyes   And your big lies   With your big eyes   And your big lies      I saw you creeping around the garden   What are you hiding?.La da da da da da da da da (Whoa...)

"Censorship can be considered as a major problem.  I believe it is our right to read and publish what we want. It should not be another person's opinion effecting what we can and cannot read, listen to, or even watch.  Lastly, censorship is a popular communist trend.  Therefore, I believe censorship is wrong.     First of all, we have a right to say, read, write, and watch what we want, as long as it is not slandering someone.  I don't believe that issue of slander is what is causing the censorship of many books today.  So, in any other case censorship would be wrong and immoral.     Second, it shouldn't be someone elses opinion that effects whether anything is censored.  My opinion @MONTH1 differ from another person's and their opinion @MONTH1 be way different from someone elses.  If they think it should be censored, they shouldn't read it themselves.  Others @MONTH1 find the book, movie, or magazine to be great and very informative or interesting.     Lastly, censorship is a communist trend.  Last I checked, the @LOCATION1 is a democracy.  So, it would be going back on our fundamentals of government to censor anything that isn't detrimental or slander to a person or race.     So, censorship shouldn't be allowed anywhere.  It is a very communist thing to do.  It infringes our rights.  Lastly, opinions are varied among people what should and should not be censored making it impossible to know what really should and shouldn't be censored.He said, ""I'm sorry, kid, you're late with the payments..We were lost on the road but you made it my home just the same,   God I wanna say that you gotta hold on when we go our separate ways      But when your radio's on, you're hearing this song   I hope that you say nothing's changed      Kings will be kings with crowns to defend   But I'm just one man and I can't pretend   A heart's just a heart and songs have to end   Dreams will be dreams and friends will be friends   Now and forever, now and forever      Kings will be kings with crowns to defend   But I'm just one man and I can't pretend   A heart's just a heart and songs have to end   Now dreams will be dreams and friends will be friends   Now and forever, now and forever..(Don't nobody care)   What, what, what, what, what.Full of the laughter   Of children out after the rain!.I get a little bit bigger, but then I'll admit   I'm just the same as I was   Now don't you understand   That I'm never changing who I am      This road never looked so lonely   This house doesn't burn down slowly   To ashes, to ashes      It's time to begin, isn't it?.Please don't be long   Please don't you be very long   Please don't be long   For I may be asleep..I have a dream come true."".O come, Thou Day-Spring, come and cheer   Our spirits by Thine advent here   Disperse the gloomy clouds of night   And death's dark shadows put to flight.....?.What are you takin'?.And maybe she cries in the middle of the night   Did you feel her?.What can one do   When a love affair is over?.Forget about tomorrow,   Until tomorrow   Let's stay here and now      Yeah it's 6 oh 8   And we're already late   But we need another go   And she arouses me so   She arouses me so      She arouses me so   She arouses me so oh oh oh oh oh oh   She arouses me so   She arouses   Really arouses   She arouses   Yeah she arouses me so.Secret message for a rendez-vous   Distant fire it's hurting you   It's so sad   Good love go's bad   Tears of love will make me sad   Frozen teardrops   Running with the night   Sorry doesn't always make it right   Tears of love tears in my heart   Why did love just break apart break apart?.Keeps me wondering why   I'm still loving you   Keeps me wondering why   All these things that you do   Keeps me wondering why   I'm still in love with you   Keeps me wondering why   All these things that you do   Keeps me wondering why   You know, I'm still in love with you   Keeps me wondering why   All these things that you do   Keeps me wondering why   I'm still in love with you.We hear he is a whiz of a Wiz if ever a Wiz there was..Do you believe in life after love?.Now give me sound from the other side every night it's gonna go on and flow on and on and on and on..But what can I do?.Baby doll, baby doll, baby doll....And carves his peg onto the finest mahagony!.Yesterday I was your man, now you don't know my name."
"Throughout history their have always been those who have refuted the beliefs and ideals of others. Whether that be in @LOCATION1 when statues were censored by removing anything deemed offensive by the @CAPS1 church or the mass burning of books to preserve ideals that could invalidated through the clear spoken text. However this in not the @DATE1, women are not looked down upon anymore, science is not dillouted, and ideas are free throughout the world with the internet. So is it the libraries fault for providing uncensored content or is the parents fault, for not educating their children on the morality of such items?     The modern library has very specific demographics for all items to which it posses. Movies over @CAPS2 attract both parents and teenagers alike, the music entices the teenagers, and the books and prior two media sources attract younger children. So how would it be fair to force a library to censor two of the things that earn the library the most money just so that kids don't read,watch or hear them. Plus libraries generally don't let young kids check out @CAPS3 rated movies or parental advisory @CAPS4.     Some people however argue that books are the most dangerous thing to children and young adults. As books can raise ideas and strengthen them in a teens mind over the course of @NUM1 pages till parents end up with an anti-sematic teen with bad view on racism. So then why would that be the fault of the library as it merely provided one book that should not have affected that teen so much, had that teen had solid moral beliefs instilled in him or her from their parents.     So if you find materials at a library offensive, or worry about your child going there, there's always an easy solution. Don't go their and don't let your child go their.

"I believe that censoring books in a library could be both good and bad.  I think that there is different levels of censorship that should be enforced depending on the library at which censorship is required.       In elementary school libraries, I think it would be appropriate to censor the books that are bought, and used in the library.  Seeing that elementary kids are not as mature as say an adult, or a high school student, their level of reading is not as advanced as ours.  Parents would definitely not want their children to be reading books that contain sex, drug usage, and any violence.  This is because reading these books might put ideas into their heads.  It @MONTH1 teach them things that they aren't supposed to do, and they @MONTH1 think that it is alright to act out on what they learn from a book.      On the other hand, high schoolers, such as myself, are interested in those kinds of books.  I am mature enough to know not to act out on what I read, and I am already aware of most of the things that books present.  While most guys are into violent books about shooting, or football books, a lot of girls are interested in the romance type of books, that possibly express more then what most kids should know.  In high schools, there should be less censory due to the fact that we are more mature and should be able to read what we are interested in.       In public libraries, I think there should be sections of books based on age level, which most libraries do have already.  This way parents taking their children to the library will know in which way they should direct them.  Everyone is obligated to their own choices, whether that choice is to read books that are more likely to be offensive, is their choice.      All in all, I don't think that books should be removed from the shelves if found offensive, because books are a type of out let to people.  They can be educational, read for entertainment, or just read to keep you preoccupied.  Books are everywhere, and people have every right to read whatever they please.  On the other hand, I think it is a great idea to censor books, and categorize them to reduce the chances of young children running into books they aren't supposed to, and to keep all of their parents happy!.(just born to be your baby..Waitin' for the night to fade   Here on a foreign shore   And all I've done is run away   Like too many nights before      Its taken far too long   To make my world my own   I'm gonna try   'Cause this time round   I've made my mind up      [Chorus]   If I think about leavin'   I'm gonna do it right, alright   'N if I'm thinkon' about holdin' on   I'm gonna do it right      Never been known to lie to me   Ain't gonna start in now   I've never been one for hide and seek   So what's all this endless doubt about      I know just what I'll do   I've got to make my move   'N I'll be fine   'Cause this time round   I've made my mind up      [Chorus]      Don't matter what you do   Just get to doin'   It'll come to you      No more maybe   No more baby   No more ""save me""      And if I want to live my life   I gotta get it up to do it right   And if I want to feel alright   Gotta shed a little light on me tonight      Oh, hold on, hold on      [Chorus: x2].This back-breakin', bone-shakin', belly-achin', hard-workin'   Two more hours to go   Yes, it's keeping me alive doin' nine to five   And I ain't got nothin to show   Pretty soon I'll be leavin'   With the wages I'm receivin'   But I know it's gonna be all right   Come on, babe, and take me away   We got some money to spend tonight   Pick me up at the station   Meet me at the train   Have a meal and a shower and a change of clothes   I can't afford a vacation   But I can take the strain   Long as I can be with you   Find a way to burn it as quickly as I earn it   Yes, it's back-breakin', bone-shakin', belly-achin', hard-workin'   Two more hours to go   Seven long years for the same corporation   And I ain't got nothin' to show   And tonight when I'm leavin' I'll be just breakin' even   But I know it's gonna be all right   I shake off my blues when you put on your shoes   We got some money to spend tonight   Oh, I don't wanna stand here and sound accusin'   Everybody does their share of losin'   If I'm gonna lose it I might as well be doin' it right   Pick me up at the station   Meet me at the train   Have a meal and a shower and a change of clothes   I can't afford a vacation   But I can take the strain   Long as I can be with you   Find a way to burn it as quickly as I earn it   Yes, it's back-breakin', bone-shakin', belly-achin', hard-workin'   Two more hours to go   Yes, it's keepin' me alive doin' nine to five   And I ain't got nothin' to show   And tonight when I'm leavin' I'll be just breakin' even   But I know it's gonna be all right   Come on, babe, and take me away   We got some money to spend tonight   Come on, babe, take me away   We got some money to spend tonight.You'll know your on it   When your brain won't stop to take a break, no!.Lucille, please, come back where you belong..All because you got burned, so you took what you needed   Some will always turn away, say it's reason enough   It's another game of exploration   Something calls at reverse and it comes to you   Experience everything as it comes true      So -

"Should books be removed from shelves if they are offensive? Who would determine if something is offensive or not and to whom it offends? These are just two questions that can create a high level of conflict and issues among many people. Would removing books from shelves limit our possibility to learn or see something from a different point of view?      First of all, who decides what is offensive and who it offends? It is possible for anything to offend anyone.  Also removing a book from the shelves could be offensive to the writter and the followers of the writter. Bringing up removing a book from shelves could cause more problems then just letting the book remain on the shelves. If offending others is the issue then would it not be better to leave it alone over all, rather than making it an issue to please one group but inturn upsetting another?      Secondly, could removing a book from the shelves limit your ability to learn something or hear something from another point of view? If books that offended people would have always been removed for reasons of offending other we could not have much of the knowledge we have today. For example a biology book might be offensive to people whos religion explains things differently and would make things untrue, and a religous document such as 'The @CAPS1 @CAPS2' or 'The @CAPS3' could be offensive to the people who believe the biology books to be true. If we removed both types of books from the shelves for being offensive, we would not have religion or modern science. This example could be used for any topic or genre of book because people can take many different things as offensive.      As a solution,  I believe it true that it is not possible to please everyone. If one person is pleased another is offended. If that person is pleased then the first person is offended. If books could possibly labeled as'some might take offensive' or 'material @MONTH1 be offensive' then people have a warning and they can choose if they want to read it or not. If they are offended they can not put blame on the author or where ever they got the book because there was a warning. It would  be just like the parental warnings on cd's. This @MONTH1 not fix the problem of people being offended, but it could very much reduce the amount of complaints about a book being offensive.     In conclusion, books should just be left on the shelves regardless of people complaining about them being offensive. Books being taken off shelves could turn into all books being taken off shelves which means no education or learning. That is just not an opition. Leaving books that offend certain people on the shelves @MONTH1 cause contraversy with others but if some sort of warning could be put in place and the proper procedures are preformed, the issues should decrease greatly. Think about all this the next time you want a book to be removed from the shelves.Yo honey-dips, summertime, fine Jheri drippin   See you on Pickens with a bunch of chickens how you're clickin'   I catch shootin' strong notes as we got close   She rocked rope, honey throat smellin' like Impulse   Your whole shell baby's wicked like Nimrod   Caught me like a fresh-water scrod, or may I not be God   Attitude is very rude Boo, crabby like seafood   It turns me on like Vassey and Lahrule   They call me Starky Love-hun, check the strategy   By any means, Shirley Temple cross was done by Billie Jean's   Black Misses America, your name is Erica, right true   Lazy eyeball, small piece, six shoe   Caramel complexion, breath smellin' like cinnamon   Excuse me hon, the Don mean no harm, turn around again   God damn, backyard's bangin' like a Benz-why   If I was jiggy, you'd be spotted like Spudz McKenzie   I'm high powered put Adina Howard to sleep   Yo pardon, that bitch been on my mind all week, but uhh   Back to you Maybelline Queen let's make a team   You can have anything in this world except CREAM   So whatchu want to do?.When I was boy   There's a dream that I had   That a war if was fought   Was for good against bad   And I woke up to find   That the world had gone mad      And we'd all fall down      And I feel like a child again   Sitting or turning   You're toying with power   Your fingers are burning   You're pushing so hard   That the worlds won't be turning      We'll all fall down      When you try to pretend   That you're a god upon high   With your party ideals   And your squeaky clean lies   When it comes to the crunch   You're no smarter than I      And we'll all fall down      If it's colour of creed or all time religion   Well fighting for that shows   A pure lack of vision   The fight that we strive   Is a fight to survive      And we'll all fall down      Well look in the mirror   And what do you see   An American, Russian   A soldier or me   When you all press the buttons   Just where will you be?.I feel like I'm breathing again,   I feel like I'm seeing again,   I feel like I'm breathing again,   I got it under control, oh, oh,   I got it under control, oh, oh,   I got it under control, oh, oh,   I got it under control, oh, oh..gives you the kiss of life   watch out, you can't ignore what's going on   when your visions are drying out   like the oceans from the underworld   don't you know!.Why do I end up always the one who is mistaken?.From this moment on, if you ever feel like letting go,   I won't let you fall,   You're never gonna be alone!.I wish I was invisible   So I could climb through the telephone   When it hurts my ear   And it hurts my brain   And it makes me feel too much   Too much too much too much..Anything at all?.Let's take it nice and easy   It's gonna be so easy   For us to fall in love      Hey baby whats your hurry   Relax and don't you worry   Were gonna fall in love      Were on the road to romance -

"Today it seems as if anything you could imagine is out in the world somewhere, somehow. Whether it is found in a magazine, a book, music, or movies is irrelevant. The fact of the matter is, if good stuff is out there, then you can generally make the assumption that bad stuff is out there too. This bad stuff is sitting around on the shelves of our libraries nationwide waiting for someone to open it up and induldge in their naughty, intense, or graphic ways.      As an @CAPS1, every man has the right to do or read what he wants. But what happens if it is not a man at all but in fact it is a child? This child is not choosing to read such bad things but just so happens to stumble upon it. Should they be punished for accidentally coming across this material and reading it? Which raises the question; who is to blame, and, what is the solution? It is a good and respectable idea to censor certain things in libraries but if someone wants to read something, they should be able to right? It is a very sticky situation and determining the answer should be a long and thought out process examining the issue from all angles, and different perspectives.      The people that have brought this issue to the surface more than likely have personal experiences that make them feel so strongly on thier views of censorship in libraries, as have I. On a dry, blistering @DATE1 day I wanted to find something to do indoors. So instead of staying home all day I walked down to the library. I had been there a lot that @DATE1 and I was pretty familiar with their selection so I was looking for something new. So I strayed out of the kid section and browsed other areas of the library. There were so many choices and options right at the tip of my fingers. I got tired of reading all the titles so I did what generally any other kid would do, and something parents have been telling their kids for centuries not to do; I judged the books by their covers. I found one that looked interesting, and long story short I just so happened to stumble upon a love story. But not the kind I was used to. It was an adult book and want into vivid detail about the relationship of a sexually active older couple. Needless to say I was speechless. Reading that stuff as a child, scared mevery much so.     Nevertheless it leads me to believe that it would be smart for censorship to be put into place in libraries. Of course, not every kid is going to have the same experience I did. In fact hardly any will. But I know that I was traumatized. So I can easily imagine how other people felt when the same thing or a realitively similar thing happened to them. But for all the other people that have not had things happen to them or that have not stumbled upon such material would probably think that it is unfair that things should be taken away from them just because other people could not handle it. But if you were like me, or any other innocent child that happened to find and experience certain things they just were not ready for would you not agree that censoring libraries is a beneficial thing to everyone? If you want things that are more intense or out there, then you can go to a bookstore, instead of a public library.     I am a teenager and I do not have children but I can only imagine how you mothers and fathers out there would feel if it was their kids who were emotionally scarred from experiences they could have been shielded from in the first place. Kids should be kids and not have to be worried about the bad things in this world, and the most effiecient way to keep that the way it is, is to censor books, music, magazines and movies from the shelves of public libraries..From Arizona   To Eldorado   Sure is a mighty long way..Let all within us praise His holy Name      Christ is the Lord, then ever, ever praise we   His power and glory evermore proclaim   His power and glory evermore proclaim.Chorus:   And it's go boys go   They'll time your every breath   And every day you're in this place your two days nearer death   But you go...      Well, a process man am I and I am tellin' you no lie   I work and breathe among the fumes that tread across the sky   There's thunder all around me and there's poison in the air   There's a lousy smell that smacks of hell and dust all in me hair      Chorus      Well, I've worked among the spitters and I breathe the oily smoke   I've shovelled up the gypsum and it neigh 'on makes you choke   I've stood knee deep cyanide, got sick with a caustic burn   Been working rough, I've seen enough to make your stomach turn      Chorus      There's overtime and bonus opportunities galore   The young men like their money and they all come back for more   But soon your knocking on and you look older than you should   For every bob made on the job, you pay with flesh and blood      Chorus      Well, a process man am I and I am telling you no lie   I work and breathe among the fumes that tread across the sky   There's thunder all around me and there's poison in the air   There's a lousy smell that smacks of hell and dust all in me hair      Chorus (x2).- man      Whatcha whatcha gonna do?.Climb Every Montain   Ooh, whoa   Climb ev'ry mountain   Search high and low   Follow every   Highway

"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 Newspaper @CAPS4,        the artedclie that you writte last week really get to me. The one about do you believe that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive to some people. i went back and fore on this, first i was thinking that if it was offensive to some people  then we sould take it down bucese if it offensiveds people then why are we selling it to the people, but then i get to thinking agian and  i was like people have the right to freedom of space and if this how they what to talk then let them space there mind.     this great courtry of ares was made on the right that every one is made the same and every one inteialed to the freedom of space. if people what to talk like thet do in there music or act they way they what to in there movies its there life if yuo dont like it dont buy it are even pay an attient to it.say if i was a raper like lil wayne or some one like that i would care about the people who are talking the way they are bucese it is my way of tilling the world how i feel about thing that are on my mind.if some one writtes some thing in a book that you dont like dont go all out and go on tv shows to make fun or till how you feel writte i letter to the author and till them how yuo feel about the topic.     every person black, white, yellow, brown, or even green has the right to freedom of space. was give to us for a ressen and i think it was for that even if you have idia but you think it is supted just say it bcuese some people think that is amazing or not. but every one is created the same so treat people the way you wont to be treated. i would like to thank you for reading this. your artedcile really open my eyes to the world and how i sould see it. thank you for writting it.                                                                   sincely,                                                              @PERSON1.Just to prove you don't really care..And behind closed eyes I cannot make them go away   'Cause you were born on the fourth of july freedom ring   Now something on the surface it stings   I said something on the surface   Well it kind of makes me nervous   Who says that you deserve this?.And nothing is enough..So oh Lord, won't you buy me a Honda Accord..A flock of birds hovering above   Just a flock of birds   That's how you think of love      And I always   Look up to the sky   Pray before the dawn   Cause they fly always   Sometimes they arrive   Sometimes they are gone   They fly on      A flock of birds hovering above   Into smoke I'm turned and rise following them up      Still I always   Look up to the sky, pray before the dawn   Cause they fly away   One minute they arrive, next you know they're gone      They fly on   Fly on      So fly on, ride through   Maybe one day I'll fly next to you   Fly on, ride through, maybe one day I can fly with you   Fly on   Fly on   Fly on.The answer's in the question Will you be home late again Will you find the courage When truth come closin' in When trust is almost broken Faith is hard to find The answer's in the question Will you leave this all behind   The heart's a lonely hunter It never quite feels safe The devil's in the details The thrill is in the chase You rise and fall like water You try to stay the same The only thing that's certain Is that everything will change How will I be remembered Will my critics be unkind   The answer's in the question You must leave this all behind.I remember the times I was lonely without her   Now she's mine and I spend my times dreamin' about her      Love her all I can and try to understand   The things that make her glad   The things that make her sad   I'm a lucky guy, I hardly ever cry   And when the world looks bad   She's never ever sad      She's so easy to please and it doesn't take money, no, no   We can have a good time when the skies aren't sunny      Ah, I love her all I can and try to understand   The things that make her glad   The things that make her sad   I'm a lucky guy, I hardly ever cry   And when the world looks bad   She's never ever sad      Whoo   I remember the times I was lonely without her   Now she's mine and I spend my time dreamin' about her      I love her all I can and try to understand   The things that make her glad   The things that make her sad   I'm a lucky guy, I hardly ever cry   And when the world looks bad   She's never ever sad.There are those who'll bet love comes but once, and yet   I'm oh, so glad we met the second time around      Love is lovelier the second time around   Just as wonderful with both feet on the ground   Who can say what brought us to this miracle we've found?.In these days of wild roses   I held a compass in my hand   I had three wishes for a future   That I won't need to understand      And I've got holly green on blood red   Manhattan Christmas on my arm   My soul ain't worth saving   Feels like I've lost my lucky charm      And I've been living in the gutter   I've been loaded like a gun   I've been sliding down the mountain   And it feels like kingdom come      And I'm always fighting windmills   Have to take it as it comes   See I'm   I'm encircled      I am   If you want me tell me   'Cause I can't play this game much longer   Feels a lot like oblivion      This feeling just keeps getting stronger   And I've been living in the gutter   Without American Express   Heroes changing horses midstream      I'm detached   I'm second-guessed   Won't you please come back and get me   My whole world is in a mess      See I'm   I'm encircled   This time I am   I'm encircled      In these days of wild roses   I'm encircled   Yeah   And I've been living in the gutter      I've been loaded like a gun   I've been sliding down the mountain   And it feels like kingdom come   And I'm always fighting windmills      Have to take it as it comes   See I'm encircled   This time I am   I'm encircled      I am   In these days of wild roses.Are we to hide inside and fear forever   A never ending road of tears   Oh, Tell me my Lord   Why am I here?.I'm not afraid that when I'm dying   There'll be no one to hold my hand   If there's a God up there he loves me   As much as my old women can      I don't intend to be a martyr   I don't give a damn what people say   And if I never get to heaven   Heaven don't deserve me anyway      I've tasted life both good and evil   At times I was cruel and did not pay   And if I never get to heaven   Heaven don't deserve me anyway      I don't know what it was I came for   But I've enjoyed it up 'till until now   If there's a friend who ever needs me   I'll do my best to help somehow      I don't intend to keep no secrets   I don't give a damn what people say   And if I never get to heaven   Heaven don't deserve me anyway      I know and I'll admit my failures   I don't give a damn what people say   And if I never get to heaven   Heaven don't deserve me anyway      And if I never get to heaven   Heaven don't deserve me

"I think that this kaind of books they maybe sometimes offend to some people that depending of what kaind or type of book, magazine, movie, music don't want to see there and agree and not agree on this because they are some some type of thinks that are not bad for kids like games for they age or music that are appropiate for there age and others like animals, cultures and all that thinks but that only think that I am not agree is that they can not be books, music, magazines, or even movies that have sexual arrasment that type of stuff not go into a library I think that that type of stuff can be dangueres or affencive for some parents and people that have or don't have kids and I think if they are in some libraries that I agree that they need to take that off because I don't want or people want that kids be disrespecfull and learn that type of thinks that they don't go with there educasion and with there age. I desagree too that this type of music that some artist are meading that they are tooking about drugs, gongs and narcotrafic and even sex and I know this because sometimes I heer this on the @CAPS1 and radio that they are sining and this influence to kids to have another directions on their life and us like parents we don't want that for our kids, don't want that fro their future, we want that they have a good future and be succefull and give them the same example to their kids to went they wrog up and  be a parent to and they are going to see what we are tooking about.I been seen it and parts of the world people been kill or people killing at other inocent persons for this type of things more for drugs that they are saling drugs and they are doing money that they are hurting to other people or kids that consume this drugs that maybe can be our kids or some friends kid and sometimes if they don't pay that money that they need to pay they kill them or that police are traying to faind them because are doing bad thinks and I hope that artist, or people that put this on the libraries think firts that maybe they are doing something wrong of steff that are thinking that are doing something good.The world humes on at it's breakneck pace   People fly in their lifelong race   For them there's a future to find   But I think they're leaving me behind..Am I wrong to believe in a city of gold   That lies in the deep distance, he cried      And wept as they led him away to a cage   Beast that can talk, read the sign..Now what in the hell is wrong with this juke machine?

"Book Censorship     Censorship in libraries are a major problem in the @LOCATION1. The question is, 'Should we have a age limit on what people can check out?' Or another question is, '@CAPS1 did they let my child check that out?' @CAPS2 are very commonly asked questions, and should have attention put toward them.     In my oponion, books should have a age limit on them. My reasoning is becuase, kids under @NUM1 years of age should have a place where they can find good books for thier age group. There are plently of books out there for all age groups. A kid under @NUM1, should not be able to check out a book, magazine, movie, or music that has offensive language, racial slurs, or dirty behivor from the character, or artist.      Another reason @CAPS1 libraries should have a age limit on things you can check out, is becuase kids can get the wrong idea. Lets say, a book has a statment in it that says '@CAPS3, I went to my bestfreind's house and drank alcohol.' @CAPS4 would be somthing that a child should not able able to read. It would give the child the wrong idea in what they 'could' be doing.     The age limits for book shelves should be as followed:@CAPS5 @NUM3 @NUM4 @NUM5 @NUM6 @NUM1-@CAPS6     @CAPS7 the books in @CAPS2 age groups would probably help stop the refrain on parents worrying about what their kid is reading. Plus, it would help the kid in deciding on what to read. I really think that @CAPS7 books in @CAPS2 age groups, will stop the commotion.     Censorship is a major problem in the @LOCATION1. With everything I have listed, I am pretty sure that the questions, 'Should we have a age limit on what people can check out?' and '@CAPS1 did they let my child check that out?' with be answered. Age groups on books, is a great idea..Glory!.You're just a ring tone   That happens when   You get sick enough   To call the one   With bullet holes   Bullet holes for eyes      Fall on your knees   I

"I believe that certain materials,such as books,movies,magazines,etc, should not be removed if they are offensive to others because censorship and libraries has their own rights to have what they want on their shilves.Yes you @MONTH1 say that some things are unapropriate for children to see but there is an children side of every libraryso that children would not have to see unapropriate things.I feel as thought that no one has the right to tell another store where to locate their things.       Also i can understand where the author is coming from but you would have to understand there is people oput there in the @LOCATION1 that would like to read or listen to unapropiate things that parent would not allow there children to see or listen to.I would also consider that @CAPS2, @CAPS1 dont let your child or children attend that library or that certain place where you know there is despictable materials there.Everyone has their own personal right to place there things where they want them to be.     There are many other options,@CAPS2 can order their books online or go to the library with their child.When I was a young girl my mom never let mee go anywhere along so i never had to worry about seeing anything unapropriate or affensive.Now a days in @DATE1 children know right from wrong.Children know what they suppose to read and does not.       I do also agree if a librarian or an adult see or hear children looking or listening to something i they know they should not be,They should stop the child or converscate them from the premises.         So No i do not agree with you.I still think that people should have the right to place there things where they want because it is their stuff and their property..I've seen that darkness on the edge of

"Everybody had their favorite movie, song, or book when they were younger. Sometimes these types of media aren't exactly child friendly. Songs today hint at sexual activities. Books about scary vampires and werewolves are being published. There are even movies that depict violent and inappropriate behaviors in which children should not witness. Does that mean they should be limited by a public place, such as a library?  Several people would agree, but I disagree.          Growing up, @PERSON1 was the wonder of my world. Her music was fun and unbeat, making a sunny day even more enjoyable. Her lyrics seemed like they meant nothing, until you thought about it a little more deeply. Even looking at the music videos, they show actions and images little children shouldn't be copying. Some @MONTH1 restrict their child from such material, but I would call that depriving a child of there freedom.           You can go to any public library and look through numerous selections of books, dvd's, cd's, and even magazines. Some library's even have computers available to the public. Not all places will carry your favorite aritist, movies, or reading material tho because they believe it isn't something little children should be indulging in. Who is to say a little kid can't enjoy the material that they'd like? That's like taking away part of a person's originality. A child would not have the opportunity to become an individual with their own opinions and feelings if they were restricted to a one mind track.          Limiting a child's media could benefit them in some way. Restricting time on computers, limiting the amount of hours playing video games or watching television could help teach a child time managment skills. Most children will see something interesting and repeat what they learned or share it with an adult and it could get them into trouble. Library's shouldn't have to take the offensive media off the shelves though. Age restrictions on renting those offensive types of materials should be set.           Just because a book or movie has language and images that shouldn't be seen by children is made, does not mean a library should limit that access to the public. Restrictions on renting that material could be set. It would solve all issues, in my opinion. In conclusion, censorship in public library's could be beneficial, but they should just set an age renting limit instead of removing all material alltogether. Therefore, making parent's happier and not restricting a person's freedom to develop there own opinion's and liking's of the different types of media.Watching my back waiting for the attack that I know is   Coming....(sadly, this was your life)      But you could have said no   If you'd wanted to   You could have said no   If you'd wanted to      BPI, MTV, BBC   ""Please them !.We got 'em drownin' in the flow, you see 'em blowin' bubbles..A witch, perhaps, will pull your hair,   Maybe a ghost will give you a scare!.Love, soft as an easy chair   Love, fresh as the morning air   One love that is shared by two   I have found with you   Like a rose under the April snow   I was always certain love would grow   Love ageless and evergreen   Seldom seen by two   So you and I will make each night a first   Everyday a beginning   Sprits rise and their dance go unrehearsed   They warm and excite us   Cause we have the brightest love   Two lights, two lights that shine as one   Morning glory and a midnight sun   Time we learned to sail above   Time the world changed the meaning of   Oh, ooh one love   Ageless and ever,   Evergreen..You stole her love from me one day   You didn't care, oh, it hurt me   But you can never steal away memories of what used to be..But keep in mind penalty fits the crime      And it deals no softened blow..But I know it's possible   To finally be in love...

"People @MONTH1 have a certain reason to take something off the shelves like books, magazines, @CAPS1, etc. Whether those reasons be personal or professional it rather important. Some @MONTH1 find the material offensive to themself. Others might find it inappropriate to have something like that available to the younger generation. And writing or music could be thought of as unneccessary and irrelevant.     The world holds many things that can be found offensive to someone. That someone could be an educated person or a high school dropout. Out of all of the stuff in the world someone is going to find something offensive to them or other people. It can be a phrase that an author uses or the name of a song. But to take something away from the people is not right and shouldn't be allowed unless it is highly offensive. They could choose to stay away from that sort of thing. Unless the offender is very public and offends pratically everyone, should it then be removed.     Other material could just be blatantly inappropriate for some to have access to. If there was a book on how to rob a bank or how to make cocaine then it should be removed because that would cause problems that could have never happened. People might learn how to do those things anyway but by allowing that to be public information would be like starting a fire that will get widely out of hand. Of course, anyone can get the notion to do something from anything they read but that is how they interpret it.     Some things out there are just inappropriate for the world and all the people on it. If you listen to a @CAPS2 and they singer or rapper starts using profanity and disrespecting a race or gender when they haven't done anything to anyone it would be unneccessary. Something like that should not be allowed in the first place and it is bad enough to be done to another singer but to talk about a race or culture in inexcusable. Or if a writer writes a story about someone, for example who just recently saved peoples lives, saying they were a horrible person and did terrible things to people when they only a little about the person and heard barely any of the story.     In conclusion, in certain instances the people should have the right to take away something that is extremely offensive not just to them but to a large amount of people.Or if the material can cause problems that should not have started. And if the writing or music is inappropriate to a race or culture should it be removed. Everyone has their rights and if writing, music, and videos are putting them down they should have the right for it to be taken from access..Ooh, really gettin' it?.[Repeat: x2]   If you see my

"This essay is about cenorship for the libarys well their shouldn't because alot of this stuff is on tv like comedy centreal, @ORGANIZATION2. @CAPS3,mtv and alot of channels.     should music be cenorship no because the blanks can ruin the beats, rythem, and the lyrics. The cenorship ruins how the song goes and it makes people mad because they like a certain song but if they want to listen to it they have to get on a computer. Websites they can get on to listen to it is @CAPS1, @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS2, and alot more.     Movies shouldn't ethier its the parents pick if they didnt want the kids to watch or hear the things they do dont pick it or tell the kids to go to their rooms.     Books!!! should not i repeat should not be cenorship because what if the adults want to read them. That aint fair for them cause all of this is a about kids. Kids are smart about this they know what to read and what they shouldn't read.     T.V. shows! is best thing ever their alot of shows thats funny,awesome,thriller,and alot more. But its gets to you. Here a example @ORGANIZATION2, @CAPS3, and more plays alot of good movies but since they have block out the words and parts of movie it really dont make sense to watch it because their not parts they really haved seen and they have to go rent it or buy it. To see the movie. Am i right?     All i am saying the cenorship ruins alot of tv shows movies and music and nobody wants that. It's ruins the enteriment for people and that sad to see cause actors, music writers, writers, and alot more speanded alot of their time for the fans and work. When they can be with their familys!!!

"Have you ever had a book, movie, or magazine offend you? Have you ever wished that no one else will ever have to read it? Should those offensive materials be removed from libraries? I don't think they should. The books, movies, and other materials should be marked saying that they @MONTH1 be found offensive.      From my own experience I know how easily one can be offended by a book or movie. Many times I have read a book that has completely contradicted my religion. Most times I will ignore it and move on to a better book or movie. Sometimes it is harder to ignore. I always try to forget and move forward with my life, as others should do.      Have you ever read the book The @CAPS1? If you have you are aware that there are some ideas in this book that bring up many controversies. One example from the book would be when they kill some of the children. Most people, like myself, do not agree with this idea. They think that it is wrong. Again some people @MONTH1 try to get this book banned, but it is still a wonderful literature.     As you @MONTH1 have seen in the media lately, many people are trying to get the book @CAPS2 @CAPS3 removed from schools. Some people have found the book as offensive because it repeatedly refers to native americans by a more profound word. The law has not passed yet and has remained in schools. The law hasnt passed because it does not affect everyone. Some people @MONTH1 not find this offensive. Therefore it was not removed.      Removing offensive books from libraries is the exact same thing. Some people @MONTH1 find the books offensive while others @MONTH1 not. Removing the books from everyone's reach would be appauling. The book @MONTH1 only be offensive to one race or religion. Why not simply put a warning label for that race or religion? That would take care of the problem by putting the decision of reading it and being offended in their hands. Possibly it isnt that the books are offensive to a race or religion, maybe it is to an age group. If that is the problem then the librarians can put those books in the appropriate age section.      I have given reasons from my own experiences, other readings, and my obersavations in the media. I only hope that you consider my ideas. Do not remove the books from the shelf only because it is offensive to one person. Simply put a warning label on the book after a few complaints. This would put the responsibility of being offended in thier hands. Once again I do not think that offensive materials should be removed from our libraries only censored to the people of whom it is offensive.I've got a perfect view   of what I really want to do   I've

most beautiful smile      My life started to change   I'd wake up each day feeling alright   With you right by my side   Makes me feel things will work out just fine      How did you know   I needed someone like you in my life   That there's an empty space in my heart   You came at the right time in my life      I'll never forget   How you brought the sun to shine in my life   And took all the worries and fears that I had   I guess what I'm really trying to say   It's not everyday that someone like you comes my way   No words can express how much I love you      How did you know   I needed someone like you in my life   That there's an empty space in my heart   You came at the right time in my life.Last night   I saw a fire burning on   The palace lawn..(Dolly Parton)   He lived by the apple orchard in this little orchard shack   His real name was Jackson Taylor but I called him AppleJack   Now old AppleJack was loved by everyone he ever knew   AppleJack picked apples but he picked the banjo too   Play a song for me AppleJack, AppleJack   Play a song for me and I'll sing   Play a song for me AppleJack, AppleJack   Play a song, let your banjo ring   Now I'd go down to AppleJack's almost everyday   We'd sit and we'd drink applejack that old AppleJack had made   Then he'd take his banjo down then he'd ask me if I'd sing   And he would play the banjo and I'd play my tambourine   Play a song for me AppleJack, AppleJack   Play a song for me and I'll sing   Play a song for me AppleJack, AppleJack   Play a song, let your banjo ring   That's when I was just a kid and now that I am grown   All I have are memories, old AppleJack is gone   Oh but he left me his banjo and it always takes me back   And everytime I play it I still hear AppleJack   Play a song for me AppleJack,

but when I see you hanging about with anyone   It's not unusual to see me cry,   oh I wanna' die      It's not unusual to go out at any time   But when I see you out and about   it's such a crime   if you should ever want to be loved by anyone,   It's not unusual it happens every day   no matter what you say   you find it happens all the time   love will never do what you want it to   why can't this crazy love be mine      It's not unusual, to be mad with anyone   It's not unusual, to be sad with anyone   but if I ever find that you've changed at anytime   it's not unusual to find out   that

"I do not think libraries should have to censor the kinds of books, magazines, etc..., because people should have the right to read anything that want.      People do not necessairly like reading some things, but if it is important that they research something, or read a book for school then they need to have the resources availablet to them. Take the book, @CAPS1 in the @CAPS2, for example. In that book it describes kidnapping, and the rape of young girls. Certain classes would require you to read this book, even though noone would really want to read about that.      Some people have different tastes in movies. Personally, I prefer horror movies (but not gory) because they get me thinking about whats going to happen next. Some people like the really graphic and gory movies, and maybe if the libraries started taking movies like this off the shelf, it would be harder for those people to find them.              Certain people would find some things more offensive than other people. Who can say where it should stop? Movies that make fun or talk about religion would be offensive to the people in that religion, but people from other religions would be un-effected by it. Just imagine watching @CAPS3 and seeing someone talk about everything you believe in and joking around about it. It would really offend people, while othre people couldn't care less.      Basically, I think we have the right to read or watch whatever makes us happy, and if there is something out there that you do not want to see, you just have to ignore it and leave it alone. It should not be ruined for other people who would like to see it.Stop everything!.It wasn't really sad the way they said goodbye   Or maybe it just hurt so bad, she couldn't cry   He packed his things, walked out the door and drove away   And she became the girl from yesterday      He took a plane across the sea to some foreign land   She stayed at home and tried so hard to understand   How someone who had been so close could be so far away   And she became the girl from yesterday      She doesn't know what's right, she doesn't know what's wrong   She only knows the pain that comes from waiting so long   And she doesn't count the teardrops that she's cried while he's away   Because she knows deep in her heart that he'll be back someday      The light's on in the window, she's waiting by the phone   Talking to a memory that's never coming home   She dreams of his returning and the things that he might say   But she'll always be the girl from yesterday   Yeah, she'll always be the girl from yesterday.Thirty nine, my hair should be parted not spiked and green   My nights should end at ten and not six AM   But it is and they don't   I still get excited when the Adolescents play

"REMOVING BOOKS FROM THE LIBRARY BECAUSE THEY ARE OFFENSIVE IS A GOOD IDEA. I DO NOT AGREE BECAUSE, THE BOOKS SHOULD NOT BE GONE FOR GOOD. THERE SHOULD BE AGE LIMITS ON BOOKS. BOOKS THAT ARE OFFENSIVE SHOULD BE ONLY ALLOWED TO ADULTS OR A CERTAIN AGE GROUP, THIS WILL HELP WITH CHILDREN NOT BEING SCARED, TO HELP KEEP HISTORY AROUND AND, FREEDOM OF SPEECH.     BY MAKING AS AGE LIMIT ON CERTAIN BOOKS, WE CAN KEEP CHILDREN INACENT AND PURE. WITH BOOKS SUCH AS '@DATE1', KIDS @NUM1 OR UNDER SHOULD NOT READ THAT BOOK. @NUM1 AND UNDER ARE STILL NIEVE. LITTLE KIDS DO NOT KNOW ABOUT SEX OR EVEN PRE-MARRITAL SEX. WITH @PERSON1 AND IS GIRLFRIEND HAVING SEX EVERY OTHER CHAPTER, ITS VERY INAPPORITE FOR A CHILD TO READ. ALSO, WITH ALL THE TORTURE PARTS, IT WOULD SCARE A LITTLE BOY/GIRL OUT OF HIS/HER MIND.     WHEN GETTING RID OF OFFENSIVE BOOKS, WE REMOVE HISTORY. THINK ABOUT WHERE WE WOULD BE IF ANNE FRANK DID NOT WRITE HER DIARY. WE WOULD NOT KNOW HOW BAD HILTER REALLY WAS. WE COULD ONLY ASSUME. WITH GETTING RID OF BOOKS CAUSE THEY ARE 'OFFENSIVE' IS A RIDICULOUS REASON. BOOKS ARE ONLY OFFENSIVE TO SENATIVE PEOPLE. BOOKS KEEP HISTORY ALIVE! THINK: 'WHAT ARE WE WITHOUT HISTORY?'     FINALLY, FREEDOM OF SPEECH IS WHY THEY SHOULD SAY. AUTHORS HAVE THE RIGHT TO WRITE WHAT THEY WANT. IF THE READER DOES NOT LIKE IT AND FINDS IT OFFENSIVE, THEN THEY SHOULD NOT READ IT. IF SHAKE SPEARE, WAS TOLD HE COULD NOT WRITE HIS STORIES, WE WOULD NOT HAVE THE TRAGETY OF ROMEO AND JULIET. SO MANY BOOKS WOULD BE LOST IF SOMEONE COULD WRITE BECAUSE IT WAS OFFENSIVE.     BOOK THAT ARE TOO OFFENSIVE  OR INAPORITE FOR A CHILD TO READ THERE SHOULD BE A AGE LIMIT ON IT. IF WE GET RID OF CERTAIN BOOKS WE GET RID OF CERTAIN HISTORY AS WELL. GETTING RID OF THOSE BOOKS TELLS A NEXT COMING AUTHOR THAT FREEDOM OF SPEECH DOES NOT MATTER TO OFFENCIVENESS. SO KEEP THE BOOKS AROUND, ITS ONLY WORDS.What do I do now?.When he put his arms around her,   He said, ""Julie, baby, you're my flame..It try my best it's not enough   Should I give up and let

"Censorship is a two sided question. There are people who believe that everything should be left the way that it is written. While other people believe that subjects that are offinisve should be removed. Is a subject too graphic for students? People have the freedom of speech. Knowledge is power. These are some reasons that can be thought about be for deciding if censoship is right or not.     What is too offinsive for a student to read? In history many things are considered offensive. If all the books that talk about history are gone then how will students be able to learn about the past. If students can't learn about the past than the past is bound it repeat itself. Other books like horror books are for entertainment purposes, so what is wrong with someone reading a book on a murder if its just for entertainment? There are books that must be kept so that students can learn to their full abilities.     If books are censored than that takes away a persons right to freedom of speech. That restricts somes creativity and since of wonder. If certain books are taken off the shelves of a library than books that are famous now @MONTH1 have never have been read. Books even if they are offensive can show someones thoughts and ideas that could have changed the world.     People everywhere learn from books. Books about the past help people understand what to do different for the future. Many things are learned from books everyday and if certain books are taken down there will be things that will never be learned, bacuse someone thought that the book was not appropriate for a student to read. Students read books about the past so that they learn. The past is the best teacher and when the past is gone there is no way for those students to learn about the past. Having books that are said to be offinsive can help in @MONTH1 ways.     All books should remain on the shelves. No matter what the book talks about a student can learn from that book. If the book is something that a student doesn't want to learn about than they don't  have to read the book. A lot can be learned from books and without books there can not and will not be knowledge that is spread for future generations to come..I wrote a goodbye note   In lipstick on your arm   When you passed out   I couldn't bring myself to call   Except to call it quits      [Chorus]   Best friends   Ex-friends till the end   Better off as lovers   And not the other way around   Racing through the city   Windows down   In the back of   Yellow-checkered cars      This city says   Come hell or high water   When I'm feeling hot and wet   I can't commit to a thing   Be it heart or hospital      [Chorus]      The tombstones are waiting   They were half engraved   They knew it was over   Just didn't know the date      And I cast a spell over the West   To make you think of me   The same way I think of you   This is a love song in my own way   Happily ever after below the waist      Best friends   Ex-friends till the end   Better off as lovers   Racing through the city   Windows down   In the back of   Yellow-checkered cars      Best friends   Ex-friends till the end   Better off as lovers   And not the other way around   Ex-friends till the end   Better off as lovers.My two fingers make a gun, shoot and kill ya peace..It took so long to realize that   You hold the light that's been leading me back home..Aah, get the burner..Dawn of our power we amuse redescending as fast as misused   Expression,   As only to teach love as to reveal passion chasing   Late into corners,   And we danced from the ocean..Wake up in the morning, my beds wet in sweat..I'm turning around, that's what I'm gonna do      Goin back home that's what I'm gonna do   Turnin' around,   That's what I'm gonna do      'Cause you've done better by me   Than I've done by you.with someone, I don't know who   Oh-oh-oh oh-oh-oh   Oh-oh-oh oh-oh-oh oh   (Chorus).It's a perfect Christmas,   It's a perfect Christmas,   It's a perfect Christmas   'Cause I'm with you!.Tell me what you want?.Eee-oh Eee-oh   Like a zippo smokes the way   Hope, around         You, your lungs and your wrists   They throb like trains   Choo choo choo   It's a prison of sound         A prison of sound         She, by the hair of my chinny chin chin   Eee-oh Eee-oh Eee-oh Eee-oh   Like a zippo smokes the way   Hope, around         You, your lungs and your wrists   They throb like trains   Choo choo choo   It's a prison of sound         I poke around....Sen sen sen sen sen sen on,   Sen on and never hang on..It's a sudden rush..[Bridge]   Honestly, I know where you're goin'   And baby, you're just movin' on   And I'll still love you even if I can't   See you anymore   Can't wait to see you soar      [Chorus]   Girl   Where do you think you're goin'?.Put me somewhere east of midnight   West of the turnpike   Anywhere I wander   Is where I'll take my rest   As I lie down, toss some thoughts around   Dreams I'm told will come true if you   Believe in those who love you right now   Sea of dreams I long for you   Forget about the others   This is my hike, you can come if you like   To feel good, I would help you if I could   But I am out here searching   For the things that might have been   I need no more reminders   Not one love letter have I seen   And that's a pretty good start   The ocean is where lovers meet again   Sea of dreams by all means   Float me out of danger until then   Forever amen   It's a long, long hike   We'll be leavin' early travelin' light   That's alright heaven will be ours tonight   The road is paved with moonbeams   There are faces that I knew   They all came back to haunt me   But that ain't fair to the folks like me and you   It takes a bit of my heart   Tonight I shall be watching from the shore   Sea of dreams from now on   Forget about all the others   Back where the line forms   Destination sea of storms   By all means ever onward sea of dreams   Put me somewhere east of midnight   Along about daylight   Anywhere I wander   Is where I'll take my rest   If we could just lie down, love   Toss some thoughts around   It's a tough and a dirty long hike   You can come if you like   If we could just lie down   Toss some thoughts around.Why don't you all f-fade away?.(today)   Why must it be this way?.Yes, love take me where we've never been before   Feelin's, just lead us on   Till we know where we're goin' mhmm..One more time..Tell me baby are you gonna take any of the blame?.You wanna go for a ride?.Why there are tears?"
"All of the materials in a library shold have to be check out of the library before anyone can take them out of the library. Which the librarian should make sure that anything that goes out of the library should have to be checked out before a student can take the materials out of the library. the topics that are going to be talked about are: why materials have to be checked out of the library, what happens if you do not check out the materials, and what happens if you lose the materials that you check out of the library.     Materials that the library has is for everyone to check out if they want to check anything out of the library. So, then the librarian will be able to tell a student if they want a book, music, movie, magazine, ect., the librarian can tell the student if the material is in or is checked out of the library. Then, the student will be able to check out the material or can ask the librarian to hold the material when it comes back in for the student. Then, the whole school can be running smoothly senice the librarian can keep track of the materials that is in the library.     If you do not check out the materials that lis in the library nobody will be able to see where the materials are at. Which, if you checked out materials out of the library the librarian can track it down for you. So, if you do not check it out the librarian will not be able to track down any of the material that is in the library. So, then the librarian can not tell a student where the materials are at and then the materials is out of the library and noone can check it out. Then, the librarian has to wait til the person that took the materials out of the library brings the materials back to the library so that it will be able to be check out by the person that wanted it when it was out of the library.     If you check something out of the library and you lose it you will have to pay for it. When you lose something from the library, that means that noone will be able to check it out until it eithers gets returned or you have to pay the librarian the money for a new one. Then the next person that wanted it will have to wait even longer to get the lmaterials because you lost the libraries copy of the materials that you check out. Then the librarian will have to make sure that the next person that wanted the materials will be able to get it when ever it came back in the library. Then, the person that lost the material should not be able to check anything out of the library anymore thay can only sit in the library to reas the materials that they either want to read or have to read for a project for a grade for one of their classes. Also, if you do not check the materials out of the library, and you lose it the the librarian will not be able to track down the materials for anyon that wants it so the check it out.     These are just some of the many reasons why you have to check out materials from the library. There is alot more reasons you hve to check out materials from the library. So, then the librarian will be able to keep up with all of the materials that is in the library, and any person can check out any material that they either want or need for a class and it does not have to stay in the library when ever you want it.When I'm gone,   When I'm gone,   When I'm gone,   You'll be gone too..Chorus   I never want you to be with some one else,   I got to have you all to myself,   After last night I really know the score,   And oh pretty baby I want it more and more   (I felt good the morning after,   Felt so good the morning after,   I'm looking forward to the night)..Breathing shifts your careless head   Untroubled by the chaos of our lives..Baby, sometimes love just ain't enough..But I never knew what happened in this world   Till I met up with mary jane,   Mary jane, mary jane, lord my mary jane..Oh!.It's the same old story,   love will find its own (oh)..No matter how hard I try   You keep pushing me aside   And I can't break through   There's no talking to you   It's so sad that you're leaving   It takes time to believe it   But after all is said and done   You're gonna be the lonely one      Do you believe in life after love   I can feel something inside me say   I really don't think you're strong enough   Do you believe in life after love   I can feel something inside me say   I really don't think you're strong enough      What am I supposed to do   Sit around and wait for you   Well I can't do that   And there's no turning back   I need time to move on   I need a love to feel strong   Cause I've got time to think it through   And maybe I'm too good for you      Do you believe in life after love   I can feel something inside me say   I really don't think you're strong enough   Do you believe in life after love   I can feel something inside me say   I really don't think you're strong enough      Well I know that I'll get through this   'Cause I know that I am strong   I don't need you anymore   I don't need you anymore   I don't need you anymore   No I don't need you anymore      Do you believe in life after love   I can feel something inside me say   I really don't think you're strong enough   Do you believe in life after love   I can feel something inside me say   I really don't think you're strong enough   Do you believe in life after love   I can feel something inside me say   I really don't think you're strong enough   Do you believe in life after love   I can feel something inside me say   I really don't think you're strong enough.A lonely man sits cheek to cheek, with unique designs in chrome....(My love)      The vow of love you broken..Christmas roses to you I'm sending   May they bring the Christmas joy though we're apart   Christmas roses will say I love you as the tender message echoes from my heart   Though I can't be with you on this Christmas Day   Remember that I'll always love you though I'm far away   Christmas roses to you I'm sending   May they bring the Christmas joy though we're apart   Though I can't be with you....You can still come round, crawl into my bed..In the glow of your light,   Let me see her tonight,   Once again, hold her tight,   Back in lover's lane..We are Renaissance children becalmed beneath the bridge of sighs,   Forever throwing firebrands at the stonework..Are you ready?.Diana!.Chorus:   Uhuu, take it slow, no need to rush,   I gotta think this through!.I've been high and I've been low   Far behind and far below   Never seen you before   If I die before I wake   Promise me   Remember me tomorrow   I've been high and I've been low   Far behind and far below   Never seen you before   If I die before I wake   Promise me   Remember me tomorrow   'Cause, 'cause, 'cause, 'cause, 'cause, 'cause, 'cause   I'll remember you   I'll remember you   (I'll remember you)..[Repeat chorus].I can't resist my own reflecions   How would possible anyone (pefect)   'cause I am (perfect)   Yes I am (perfect)   Yes I am (perfect)   Oh I am (perferct)   Oh lord I am (perfect)      Yes I am, I am a perfect gentleman   Yes I am, I am a perfect gentleman   Yes I am, I am a perfect gentleman   Yes I am, I am a perfect gentleman.Hey, though at this moment I can't think of what we'd say   I guess we really want to be just like them...

"To whom it @MONTH1 concern:          As time goes on in this ever-expanding world of ours, it seems that one thing that is constantly being fought and argued is censorship. Censorship allows things in our world that are viewed as 'offensive' to be comprimised.     People these days though. must be getting offended much more easily these days, because it seems that media is censored more than it ever has been. I for one, am sick of having the 'veil over the eyes' as it were. Most censorship in this country is run through programs our government has established, censorship shouldn't be up to a organization, but instead to the person viewing it. In other words, why should other people decide what is most pleasant for us to watch? Nobody knows you better than yourself, so why shouldn't you decide?      Why should censorship exsist in our media if it doesn't exsist in our everyday lives? There are plenty of things people see that they regret seeing, it's all in how you take it. No matter who it is, people are going to see things they don't want to see, that's just life.      Censorship denies our rights as @CAPS1 citizens to have the right for free speech. If you don't like something you're seeing, then look away yourself.In The Daily News, the caption read,   ""Save the life of my child!"".Hear the snow crunch, see the kids bunch, this is Santa's big scene,   And above all this bustle you hear      Silver bells, silver bells, it's Christmastime in the city..Crack a smile, here the sound..Could be quite a day      And I sang that pretty tune   An open airy song   And my heart looped the loop   Well I could do no wrong..Maybe one day   So don't turn on the lights   I'll give you what you like.Oh, and when you mention my name   Make you sure you know the truth   Until I'm about to keep it forever      [Chorus: x2].I want to spend each moment of the day with you..Up to the heaven she turns her eyes..We'll end up heading?].You say, ""Son, let's forget the past,   I want another chance, gonna make it last."".Where you didn't have the strength to look after yourself..Some quiet morning let me let me tell you my mind   Before the sun find you here beside me one more time let me tell you my mind   How I want you to stay and never think about goin' away   Oh oh baby let me tell you my mind oh oh baby let me tell you my mind   Crazy things keep a running through my head let me tell you my mind   When my shoes are under your bed one more time let me tell you my mind   Tell you of the thrills I find they will keep running through my mind   Oh oh baby let me tell you my mind mhm oh oh baby let me tell you my mind   If my mind could write the words to say let me tell you my mind   I'd read them to you some better day one more time let me tell you my mind   If my story never ends and I never have you again   Oh oh baby let me tell you my mind oh oh baby let me tell you my mind.Good morning lethargy   Drink pepsi it's good for energy   The bath's on, smoke in the bedroom   Sore throat and on my neck a nasty bruise   And where it came from, well I don't know   But we played last night, it was a good show      Got the play out, second rate chat show   It's a nation wide deal, so we gotta go   Chap from the company says it will be alright   Got an add on KRO   And there's an in-store tonight   Well I built things up   And then I let them go   Got to get time share on the radio      Look inside America, she's alright, she's alright   Sitting out the distance   But I'm not trying to make her mine   Looking for America   With its kooky nights and suicide   Where the TV says it's alright   Coz' everybody's hung up on something or other      Steppin' off in 20, so the driver says   I should sleep tonight   But I think I'll watch videos instead   Annie Hall leaves New York in the end   Press rewind and Woody gets her back again   And the whole world could have passed through me   But I don't know if it means much to me      Look inside America   She's alright, she's alright   Sitting out the distance   But I'm not trying to make her mine   I'm looking for America   With its kooky nights and suicide   Where the TV says it's alright   Coz everybody's strung out on something or other      And the whole world   Could have passed through me   But I don't know if it means much to me.Silly boy boy (boy boy)   Acting acting silly boy?.I want to avoid the rush..(All down the line.).Gold lion's gonna tell me where the light is,   Gold lion's gonna tell me where the light is,   Take our hands out of control,   Take our hands out of control      Now, tell me what you saw,   Tell me what you saw,   There was a crowd of seeds,   Inside, outside,   I must have done a dozen each      It was the height I threw, the weight,   The shell was crushing you,   I've been around a few      Tell me what you saw,   I'll tell you what to...

"Hello I am kristin, I am here to tell you why we should take some magazines out of our public libraries. Now I dont know if you have heard about @CAPS1 the magazine or @CAPS2 magazine. But I have and I also use to read them. In some of thouse issues are sex tips.           Now if I was a mother and my child ran up to me beging me to let them cheek that thing out I would look at them and say no. They dont need to undestand sex untill they are in there teens or atleast thirteen or fourteen. A child shouldnt be able to even go near that area they should only be able to go near the children's section.           Some parents think like me and agree with the fact that a child shouldn't learn about sex. But others are like why not they are going to know about it in @CAPS3 @CAPS4 and when they are married also.           There are also some other things that need out of a librarie. Some music might not be the best choice for a young child. Like for example rap music. It has allot of cussing in it and talking about sex. Some of the things said in a rap song are shorty let me rind you like a huricain. Thats just like saying hey chick lets do it for the heck of it. Thats not what I want my kid to listen to. I want my child to listen to stuff that says hey lets go outside and camp or duck duck gusse.              Some movies are okay to watch with your kids as long as its not over @NUM1. But if it is they can't watch it. I'll give you another example my little neice is probubly around the age of ten or so. She watche's @CAPS5 @CAPS6 but only with her parents inthe same room as her. She can not watch it by herself or she will get grounded.      This is why some of the stuff should be taken out of our public Libraries.""The army is the only way out for young black teenagers..[Intro]   Oh man, oh man, oh man, not again      [Verse]   Yeah, I

"Do yo think censorship is a good thing? Do you think libraries should take more responsability on what they offer to people? Many people think they should. But I disagree, if they dont want to learn about that topic than don't read the book.          Public libraries are a great help for the community. They are reallly helpful for children who dont have certain materials at home. Libraries do think about what information children view. That is why there are restricted areas for children of certain age. Also its not always about what the library displays, but also about the parents who let their kids read things they are not supposed to read. If to some people some information is offensive, to others it might not. People will always have different points of view.           This materials cannot be removed, they might be important in some  points of our lifes. All information is helpful in some way. The inmense ammount of knowledge our libraries have should not be taken away just because someone want to.He's overcome but must succumb to what he's living for      He tried and tried all those survived he missed, he's fallen short   The little known, his heart of stone, will make him feel alone.Grab a beer, throw it back, take a hit,   Talkin' smack party yeah-rock the party   Pull some strange, take a shot, rally back back yeah-rock the party      So I say   Lets make some bad decisions   Do things we won't remember   So call your friends tonight      Lets see through double vision   The best night we won't remember   So lets get fucked all right   Yeah call your friends tonight      Lets go all night   Footprints on the ceiling   Lights on, pants off, just another weekend   Won't remember tonight, wake up feeling like, what the hell happened?.Leave your stepping stones behind, there's something calls for you   Forget about the dead you've left, they will not follow you   The vagabond who's rapping at your door   Is standing in the clothes you once wore..What?.Feeling weak from his lies, all of his bad wicked lies,   If you believe and your faith just dies..[Chorus]   Its not that I don't wanna love you   Its not that I'm really over it, you know (you know)   Its just that I can't watch us bleed to death   When we used to be   Brooklyn Nights happy..It seems a little silly   For a girl of my age and weight   To walk down piccadilly in a haze of light..Wake up, wake up, wake up!.Mustapha Mustapha -

"In the book '@CAPS1 @NUM1', books are outlawed. In such a society, owning a book would result in recieving a punishment. Without books, @CAPS2 people turned to electronics for entertainment. The society as a whole had lost @CAPS2 human emotions and became submissive to the government. @CAPS4 led to injustices that the government inflicted upon its people because it didn't have any opposition. Katherine Paterson suggests that if books begin to be thrown out, there will be 'no books left on the shelf for any of us.' @CAPS2 people argue that certain media should be removed from libraries because they find it offensive. However, if every piece of media that was requested to be removed was taken out, @CAPS2 important works would be thrown away.     A recent debate has arisen over @PERSON1's 'The @CAPS3 of @ORGANIZATION1.' @CAPS4 book is set in the @LOCATION3 during the time of slavery. @ORGANIZATION1 @PERSON4 befriends a black man, @PERSON6, and shares @CAPS2 experiences with him along the @LOCATION1. @PERSON1 decided to write his book using the true diction of the people who lived in the @LOCATION3 during @CAPS4 time period. He was the first author to do @CAPS4. Because he wrote it in @CAPS4 way, the book contains the n-word multiple times. @CAPS4 word is not acceptable today, and therefore @CAPS2 people take offense to his work. However, @CAPS4 book plays a major role in the @CAPS5 cannon. @PERSON1's work was written in a new and breakthrough method. If someone were to remove @CAPS4 work off of the shelves of libraries, he would remove one of the most important pieces of @CAPS5 literature.     '@ORGANIZATION2' by @PERSON3 is a book that explores the life of a convict in prison. During his time at @LOCATION2, he discovers that he is a homosexual. He falls in love with a man named @PERSON5 and begins to have sexual relationships with @CAPS2 of the men in his cell. These relationships are described in detail. If one were to read the surface of the book, he would find a crude description of a convict's experience in prison. However, @CAPS4 is not the case. @PERSON3 struggled with the concept of being bisexual throughout his life. He also had problems with his parents and brother. In '@PERSON2', he wrote about his own feelings through his characters. @CAPS4 story is not about sex, but about feelings of entrapment and the relationships one has with other people. If @CAPS4 book were to be removed from libraries, @CAPS2 people would miss a story that they might connect with.     Katherine Paterson brings up an interesting question. What would happen if everyone could remove the books they dislike? The answer would be a society that is unable to share ideas, concerns, and experiences. Media helps to enlighten, persuade, and educate people about important issues. While some works @MONTH1 have offensive language, they also have a deeper meaning..Why you come tonight to take my live?.Don't say it's the end of the road..One by one, from the mountains to the sea,

"Communities have many different types of people that live in them. Certain groups of people find some things offensive while others find them totally nomal. Some of these things cause conflict. A library, for example, is one place you @MONTH1 find some of these conflicts.     Most libraries are open to the public. Therefore, many different groups of people will be sharing the material in the library such as books, movies, magazines, and music. Having many different kinds of people sharing this material, the libraries must try to have material to please everyone. This is where the conflict begins. While trying to please everyone, some people @MONTH1 find some of the material offensive. Now for the big question: Should material some find offensive be removed from the shelves all together?     The answer to this big question is no. Libraries must have many different kinds of materials in them to please everyone in the community. People are different and believe in different things. Just because one person finds some type of material offensive doesn't mean it is offensive to everyone. For example, things such as religion. Someone @MONTH1 find a book on a type of religion and find it very offensive, but others @MONTH1 strongly believe in that reigion. Just because one person takes it offensively, doesn't mean those who don't should have it taken away from them.     Libraries are for all kinds of people. Just because one person finds the material offensive, doesn't mean it should be taken away from everyone else. If libraries took any material that anyone found offensive in any way off the shelves, there would be no material left. People believe in different things. That is the way it always has been and more than likely, the way it will always be.[Chorus]   Yeah, I'm throwed off   Ain't about the money I'ma blow it off   I made my own lane, let's roll, let's

sang by Dusty on her TV show in 1967)      Where Lagan stream sings lullaby   There grows a young man fair   The twilight gleam is in his eye   The night is on his hair   And like a lovesick lenan he   He hath my heart in thrall   No life I owe, no liberty   His love is lord of all      And often when the beetles' horn   Hath lulled the eve to sleep   I steal unto his shieling lorn   And thro' the dooring peep   There on the cricket's singing stone   He spears the bird in fire   And hums in sad, sweet undertone   The song of his desire.See my days are cold without you   But I'm hurtin while im

"Everyone has found something offensive throughout their life. However, many people find different things offensive than others. There are many different topics that people are offended of whether it is race, religion,gender,etc.       If there is a book that you find offensive in a public library I do not think it should be removed. It is like removing something just because one person does not like it. That would not be fair to everyone else that goes to that library. It @MONTH1 be offensive to you but to another person it @MONTH1 not be. There are many reasons that book could be in the library. It could help someone write a paper, to learn about a subject, or do some research on a topic. If all the books, music, magazines,movies or any other item in a library was to be removed if one person found it offensive then there would hardly be any books at all left in the library.      I think all books should be kept in the library even if one person finds its offensive. It could be offensive to them but not to someone else. If one person finds a book offensive and another person doesn't then it is not fair to the one that isn't offened to not be able to check it out.      If the concern is if children check it out what they might be learning from it then that would be the parents fault for not supervising what their children are checking out. The child @MONTH1 learn something new from the book.      Even if it is offensive you could still learn something from the book, movie,magazine, music, etc. If you still read the book it could help you change your mind on the topic. It @MONTH1 help other people change their mind by bringing new opinions about the topic to their mind that they have never thought of.      One condition on why a book,movie,magazine,music,etc would be removed would be if everyone agreed on it. If everyone that came to that library was offended by it then it @MONTH1 be in the library's best interest to get rid of that book.      The main idea here is that all books that are in the library should stay in the library. The author wrote it for a reason and it should be open to those who want to read it. If one person does not like it then they should simply not check the item out. If that was what happened everytime someone found something offensive in a library there would be hardly anything to check out. Even if it is offensive to you it could come in handy for another person.To fill, and spill over, and under my thoughts..Love is illegal in my heart   Hear my heart is beating      You're looking through a fire   Computers everywhere   Oh, you're a shotgun rider   Controllers here and there   And you read old love letters   Drowning in the sea   Oh baby it doesn't matter   Oh you've lost all what you feel   Can you feel my heart?.Way hey and a way we go donkey riding donkey riding,   Way hey and away we go riding on a donkey..And touch my body, anywhere,   I'm yours tonight, make it right,   Baby just take me there..Not very much      I got no people here on my boat   Just a hot jug of wine and a net full of hope   I got no money but I'm still afloat   Lost my luck to the wind so I row and I row      I got this girl who waits back on the shore, oh, Lord   Sees me row, says she don't know what for, that's all   Ain't got no fish when I'm at her door   But in the morning when I leave she's begging for more, and more      I got no people here on my boat   Just a hot jug of wine and a net full of hope, that's all   I got no money but I'm still afloat   Lost my luck to the wind so I row and I row, yeah      This cat and mouse game surely must end, oh, Lord   Catch all the fish, who'll left to be friends?.Is that the question?.My sister should have come in at midnight,   And my mum would always sit up and wait..Look at me, I'm shaking,   I don't know if I can move      I don't need   This attention again   I've lost time   I could lose everything   You will learn   That you've nowhere to go so go.Glory, glory, hallelujah,   Glory, glory, hallelujah,   Glory, glory, hallelujah,   And he ain't gonna jump no more!.Yelling, nobody cares!.You don't care much for a stranger's touch,   But you can't hold your man..I wear the cat-skin gloves..Maybe that's just your way   Of dealing with the pain   Forgetting everything between our rise and fall   Like we never loved at all      Did you forget the magic?.""This is it"" he thinks, failing to move any of the fallen rocks.What have I been guilty of?.When I promised her forever,   That I'll be by her side..If you knew that you would die today   If you saw the face of God and Love   Would you change?.I've been dreaming..I'm a very lonely man, doing what I can,   All the world astounds me and I think I understand   That we're going to keep growing, wait and see..You can say what you want   Say what you want   But it won't change a thing   Won't change a thing      You can say what you want   Say what you want   But it won't change a thing   Won't change a thing      'Cause I saw you with another guy   I saw you with another guy   Yeah, I saw you with another guy   Holding hands, kissing eye to eye      You can cry all your like   Cry all you like   But it don't change a thing   Don't change a thing      You can cry all your like   Cry all you like   But it don't change a thing   Don't change a thing      'Cause I saw you with another guy   I saw you with another guy   Holding hands, kissing eye to eye   Yeah, I saw you with another guy      'Cause I saw you with another guy   I saw you with another guy   Yeah, I saw you with another guy   Holding hands, kissing eye to eye      You can say what you want   Say what you want   But it won't change a thing   Won't change a thing      You can say what you want   Say what you want   But it won't change a thing.When you had nothing I gave..Two lifes, one fate   I have to leave   So will you follow me?"
"Materials, such as books, music, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive! It's a public library. Not many people would like to find something that seems to hurt or harm them in any way.      Libraries are for people to come in and should be expected to enjoy something, whether it be a book, movie or magazine. When people come in looking for some good information about something, they look forward to finding good tips, and not being let down. Example, with something possibly about someone being racist. That's dissapointment to some. Noone should have to walk in and find something that offenses them. It's not fair.     Now, to parents with children. Would you like for your child going into a library that is allowed to look wherever their little heart desires, and they come upon porn or just anything that would be a bad influence on them? I highly doubt it. Unless, you just don't care about what your kid reads these days, but to the ones who want their child having a good education, well, you understand my statement.     It's just not fair to the ones who go to a library expected to be satisfied, but instead are let down. It does them no good, and it could make your community look bad. Libraries are to help people with information, fun facts, and all around good resources. So, please put the bad books, music, magazines, etc. away!.While I was wonderin where to start   You were there to show me   All I had to learn      You were way off the mark   Most of it in the dark   Found you now      Tiny light, give the peace   With which we reach indecision   I guess we lived in the meantime   Till we remembered our first lines      We must have missed a turn   Still got a lot to learn   Found you now      So now we live a life of give and take   Day by day   We don't control where it leads us      If we compare the first day we met   I must admit nothings changed   I

"I beleive censorship is a good thing; to an extent. I think that censorship deals with an age group and the permission of the parent(s) or guardian(s). If a consumer is the age of twelve and under; then the consumer should buy the censored books and etc., but, if you are thirteen and above you should be able to buy product uncensored.     Some people do not like censored products because they feel it takes away from that particular thing. Music, for example, alot of people get angry when the song lyrics on a @CAPS1 are censored. It does not allow the people to get the full effect of the music and the 'message' that the artist or band is sending.     With books; people get upset because they cannot get the full aspect of the book. Censoring a book is like taking away part of a masterpiece. Some books should be censored like alot of romance novels; those get pretty graphic and go into alot of detail with sexual themes and content. I do not think those books should be on the shelves.     In magazines; it depends on the type of magazine the consumer is reading. If a person is reading a politcal magazine; those magazines do not put all of the true facts and details into them for certain reasons. If a person is reading a hunting or fishing magazine; then they can put in all the facts on the guns, calls, lures, and stories they want and do not have to censor them.     Movies, on the other hand, are censored on certain channels. If you are watching a movie on a @CAPS2 network like @ORGANIZATION2 or @CAPS3; those channels censor movies. If you watch movies on @ORGANIZATION1 or @CAPS4 they do not censor the movies because those are movie channels only. That is also why movies have ratings. R is for restricted to people under seventeen (without an adult present) , @NUM1 is for people of the ages sixteen and under without an adult. and @CAPS5 and @CAPS6 are fine for any age group.     All in all; censorship depends on what age group the consumer is in really. If you are still in elementary school you probably should not be able to buy uncensored products; if you are thirteen to about fifteen, you should be able to buy the product with permission from an adult, and if you are sixteen and older you should be able to buy the products uncensored with out an adult present because you know you can handle the 'offensive' matierial.Ohoo   Everything that

"In my life time I have been to many libraries. I also seen many diffrent catagories of books suck as comedy, fiction, non-fiction, drama, and etc. As we all know there are many topics out thier that is not suitable for minors or suitable for many other ages.     Movies in this time and age reveal to much for you eyes. For example in cartoons their are sexual content such as kissing .Some parents don't want their child expose to the kind of activity yet. Movies somtimes put false beliefs in peoples mind about the way things are, going to be,or the why you sould see it.Their are also some good movies place in libraries such ass docomentries, history , biography, and etc. Thats gives you good insite on how things was and hoe things are now.     Another topic is magazines. Its strange things going on in the world that @CAPS1 sould be aware of the why we put them in magazines but children have easy access to them in libraries. Picture that magzines have are images that sould be places in some magazines. As there are bad things there are also good that come from magazine. Magazines are in some ways just as useful as books. They carry very helpful information.     Music is aslo a big topic thats placed in libraries. Some of the lauguage thats is place on  cd tracks are good BUT  theirs alot of bad material that on them also. So many people out the known as @CAPS2 say some very harsh and profaine words that many and children sould just not want to hear. Like I said before as their is bad thier is much good. We have gospel , jazz, @CAPS3&@CAPS4, and etc that many people enjoy listing to.     In conclusion thier are many things good that belongs in libraries but also many bad. Libraries in my opinion sould take more caution on what people have access to. Very easy a young child (that can read) can pick up a adult book go sit in a corner read and be expose to most things parents are expose to. So in my opinion yes certin things should be removed from the shelves if the are found offensive..Whisper, are you dying in my ear?.You with your lack of time      Me with my lack of space,   Where are you my love?.Come on over and sit right down,   Let me take your hand,   I got a love gonna fill you up,   Take you to the promised land..(And my native land, alas!).I'm on the road   Hello hello, I'm all alone   Ah yes everybody smiles at me   As I go walking by   But I'm really glad I've only got my own   S.O.L.O..Can't be the money   Well I got news for you      Two souls (should be two souls together)   Two souls (in the life that we planned)   But you're working obsession is squeezing me   Out of your world      I'd rather live in a doll's house in a small street   Where it always rains   You kid yourself you're working all for me   But older kids play with bigger trains      It's not too late to start over   It's not too late to turn 'round   It's like we live in separate worlds   Can't buy the lost time   I want my share of you   I want my share of you      Two souls (should be two souls together)   Two souls (in the life that we planned)   But you're working obsession is squeezing me   Out of your world      Can't buy the lost time   I want my share of you   I want my share of you      Two souls (should be two souls together)   Two souls (in the life that we planned)   Out of your world.They say ev'ry man needs protection,   They say ev'ry man must fall..Oh-oh-ooh-oh-oh-oh!.All they ever found were some bones,   And occasional pieces of skin, of skin,   Occasional pieces of skin..With the help in love we can follow..I went down to Captain Tony's   To get out of the heat   I heard a voice call out to me   ""Son come have a seat""   I had to search my memory   As I looked into those eyes   Our lives changed like the weather   But a legend never dies      [Chorus]   He said I ate the last mango in Paris   I took the last plane out of Saigon   Took the first fast boat to China   And Jimmy there's still so much to be done   I had a third world girl in Buzios   With a pistol in each hand      She always kept me covered   As we moved from land to land   I had a damn good run on Wall Street   With my high fashion model wife   I woke up dry beneath the African sky   Just me and my Swiss Army knife      [Chorus]      We shot the breeze for hours   As the sun fell from the sky   And like the sun he disappeared   Before my very eyes   It was somewhere past dark-thirty   As I went back to the head   I read upon the dingy walls   The words the old man said      [Chorus: x2].Guess this is where I get off   Yep, member everything I told ya?.There's a lily in the valley   where I brought the news to Ro   I offered him my visions but   the heathen rose to go   So I took my shining sabre and I slew   my sinning friend   A christian burial was all he needed   to make him whole again   And I looked up way above me   and God rent the sky apart   Bury my heart!.Some stingin' goin' on..Oh no, it's raining again   Too bad I'm losing a friend..I've got to stop them from compelling you, girl   They just wont stop me from getting you.....

"Censorship in libraries is a very controversial topic that has conflicting views. One side, in favor of censorship, believes that some literary material contained within a library could be offensive to some, and that it should be removed or censored. The other side, in favor of free speech, believes that all literary material in a library should be kept, whether it is seen as offensive or not. Of these two sides of such a controversial issue, it is evident that censorship should not be instilled within libraries, because of the right to free speech, the true meanings and expressions must be upheld, and it would take the oppurtunity to read such a work truly from an interested reader.     The first reason why the censorship of literary materials within a library is an unjust endeavor is because of the right to free speech. This right belongs to all citizens of @LOCATION1, and shouldn't be taken away because one person @MONTH1 think something is offensive. I have observed that many people will often attempt to steal this right from people, and this instillation of censorship will do just that to the authors. This is the first reason why the censorship of literary materials within a library is an unjust endeavor.     The next reason why the censorship of literary materials within a library is an unjust endeavor is because this censorship @MONTH1 dull down the true meanings and expressive themes that literary works are meant to express. An example of a story that would suffer from censorship is the famous 'The @CAPS1 of @ORGANIZATION1.' Such a novel, though containing offensive language at times, would not read the same if such language was omitted and removed. Instead, @PERSON1's expressions within the story would be dulled down immensely and be nearly silenced. This is the next reason why the censorship of literary materials within a library is an unjust endeavor.     The last reason why the censorship of literary materials within a library is an unjust endeavor is because it removes the availability of the book from an interested reader. Many times I have seen people blatantly have a tantrum over an offensive literary work. I have been offended by things that I have read before, and instead of demanding its removal and crying for a less offensive substitute, I simply either stopped reading the work or read through it anyways. A person must know that the use of offensive language within literary works rarely is intended to attack the reader, but rather to strongly get a point across.  If a person finds the material too offensive to read, then they should simply stop and find a more suitable work. By remaining calm and passive about these things, it keeps the literary work on the shelves in its true form for other people who wish to read it.This is the last reason why the censorship of literary materials within a library is an unjust endeavor.     It is clearly evident that the removal or censorship of literary works in a library is a bad idea as a whole. The decision to censor literary works would be bad because it would strip the author's right to free speech, it would dull down the author's true meanings and expressions, and it would remove the oppurtunity to read such a work from an interested person. The removal or censorship of literary works would be a terrible decision that all would regret in the years to come. This is why the removal or censorship of literary works in a library is an unjust endeavor..Feel it running off   So strong and clear   An age is over fast   And disappears   Help him if you can   His hour will come soon   Push away his fear   He'll see Elysium   It's time   It's time      Guard him a little while   And calm his shiver   Wash and dry his tears   And cold his fever   Take the bibles words   Speak it pure his soul   Lay love in his mind   His close to the final goal   It's time   It's time      It's time to go   Time for the freedom   Time to face what we all believe in   Pray strong   Pray to the higher   Turn your back on the devil's fire   Time to go   Time for freedom   Time to face what we all believe in   Time is passing by      When his mind is clear   He called your brother   Now his brain is dazed   It's resigning rather   Mother take his hand   Say a last good-bye   We're not gifted to   Turn water into wine   It's time   It's time      It's time to go   Time for the freedom   Time to face what we all believe in   Pray strong   Pray to the higher   Turn your back on the devil's fire   Time to go   Time for freedom   Time to face what we all believe in   Time is passing by.Then she's in control!.Juda-ah-as   Juda-as!.Look at you..The river is up, the logs are floatin'   Let's get married and stop this courtin'   I'm ready, ready-ready as I can be   I'm ready-ready, ready-ready-ready-ready-ready for you   If you're ready-ready for me   The clouds are formin', it's startin' to rain   Let's get married without a ring   I'm ready, ready-ready as I can be   I'm ready-ready, ready-ready-ready-ready for you   If you're ready-ready for me   The prices are up and no-one's biddin'   Let's get married and stop this kiddin'   I'm ready, ready-ready as I can be   I'm ready-ready, ready-ready-ready-ready-ready for you   If you're ready-ready for me.You got me..He lives in Cambridge..I have dined with kings, I've been offered wings   And I've never been too impressed..There's never been such a day   In Beverly Hills, L.A..Yeah, my bucket's got a hole in it   Yeah, my bucket's got a hole in it   Yeah, my bucket's got a hole in it   I can't buy no beer      Well I'm standin' on a corner   With a bucket in my hand   I'm waitin' for a woman   That ain't got no man      'Cause my bucket's got a hole in it   Yeah, my bucket's got a hole in it   Yeah, my bucket's got a hole in it   I can't buy no beer      Well, I went upon the mountain   I looked down in the sea   I seen the crabs and the fishes   Doin' the be-bop-bee      'Cause my bucket's got a hole in it   Yeah, my bucket's got a hole in it   Yeah, my bucket's got a hole in it   I can't buy no beer      Well, there ain't no use   Of me workin' so hard   When I got a woman   In the boss man's yard      'Cause my bucket's got a hole in it   Yeah, my bucket's got a hole in it   Yeah, my bucket's got a hole in it   I can't buy no beer      Yeah, my bucket's got a hole in it   Yeah, my bucket's got a hole in it   Yeah, my bucket's got a hole in it   I can't buy no beer.If you're ever lonely, I want to be lonely too, Woah..What's the matter?.Cuz I just wanna walk you home..Still I can't find my way home,   And I ain't done nothing wrong,   But I can't find my way home..Every evening you will find him,   Around our neighborhood..(graham russell)   A long time ago, from the valley of the sun   Came the holy power,   When the gods were one   Searching for a new home,   Searching for this land   Guided by the stars, and a vision they had seen   The pillars of the temple,   In these hills of green   Buried deep inside for only us to find   (chorus)   It is the roar of the wind,   The power of the sun   The strength of a thousand bows   And those who near it again, will fear it again   And it's here in the heart of the rose   Painted in the sky was the moment to awake   All that lay within you,   As this dawn should break   With this force awoken, none can stand before   This is the hour, now is the time   Driven by the purest love, I give you mine   All that we must be, is everything we see      (chorus)   Our love, has brought us both together   And it's our love that will go on forever   There is no love that can become as one   Before it's time      (chorus)   It is the trees in the earth,   It is the rivers that run   And through us this secret flows   And now our destiny calls,   You'll remember it all   Our love for the heart of the rose.A cozy little home out in the country   With two kids or three..Who's that?"".Don't answer that..Each night I pray we'll never part   Because the love within my heart   Grows stronger from day to day..The stars are aglow..I love my dog as much as I love you   But you may fade, my dog will always come through."
"Reading is something people choose to do for their own entertainment, for their enjoyment,  to gain personal knowledge and many other reasons. Reading should not be restricted by any means. If a person has an interest in a book, they should be able to read it if they so choose. I believe that censorship within a library is not something that should be done.     For a person to be able to take away another persons right to read a book of his or her choice, is mind boggling. I know that some books can be pretty desciptive and graphic but these boundaries sould be set within a home. If a parent doesn't want their child reading a book don't take in out on the entire community. It's not fair to everyone else.     If you personally don't find entertainment or enjoyment out of a book that you consider offensive, there are many other alternative books to read. Nobody is forcing you to be miserable and read a book you don't like, that is why there are many sections in a library. The sections in a library range from mystery to romance, so find a different book and leave the offensive ones to people who like to read them. That way you are happy and so is everyone else.     Libraries are places people visit to check out and read books. Usually a person chooses a book because of the cover or a friend has requested you to read it. If libraries start to remove books from the shelves then there won't be any left for the rest of us to read. Not only will there be no more books but there also won't be anymore libraries for people to go to.     Just because a few people think that there are some offensive words, scenes and or other ideas in a book doesn't mean that it is right to take away the privilidge of another person to read it. If you have a problem with it, don't read it. It's that simple. Don't make other book readers suffer because of one persons opinion..It's all that I can do to keep that little demon...

"I do believe that certain books, music, movies, and other media should be removed from the shelves of libraries, if they are found to be offensive. We do not need anymore reasons for people to judge someone based on something that they read.     If the media is offensive, than someone's feelings will get hurt. I remember a time when I read a book, and it had some really offensive things about homeless people. I felt bad just for reading this, because it just made them sound like horrible people. Which in a lot of cases isn't true, but I remember people that read it and they believed of every word of it. Those people now rudely look down on them. So why would we allow this book to be in the library? This book changes the way many people think, and so do many more books.     There is a lot of offensive music too. Today most of the songs people listen to are, but we just don't realize it. These should not be available in a library, cause anybody could rent them. Which isn't good, cause they could really hurt someone's feelings by just singing a song they think is okay.     Another thing libraries need to watch are magazines. Most magazines are okay, but some like to throw in little inapproiate stories. So to really protect everyone and anyone they need to really go through the magizine and make sure its not offensive at all.     The media I think libraries really need to sit down and think over if they are okay, or not are definately movies. They need to realize that kids could rent these, and think are they apporiate. I think libraries should only have family oriented movies. This way nobody is harmed by anything they will veiw.      In conclusion, libraries should be extra careful in their media choices. They need to try and limit everything that is offensive, to try stop anybody from getting harmed.Girl make a list   Go out and find yourself a new plaything   Oh girl you need a trip   'Cause he's not worth the misery and pain      So just remember how he would tell you lies   And then pretend that everything was so sweet   No need to sacrifice   If you're not satisfied   He's just a canine running round on heat      Girl, you must resist   Don't let him squirm his way into your heart   Oh girl you must insist   You've got to stop the fool before he starts      So just remember how he was so untrue   And all the tacky things he did to you   No need to sympathise   'Cause he's not worth the time   You've got to find someone who's true to you      Girlfriend, how could you let him treat you so bad   Girlfriend, you know you're the best he's ever had   Girlfriend.Come back home to me, help me spend my dough..And if I only could,   I'd make a deal with God,   And I'd get him to swap our places,   Be running up that road,   Be running up that hill,   With no problems..Hey, I can see that smile on your face   Tonight memories will never erase   And I feel like our time has come   Our hearts are beating wild as one   True love I know is hard to find   But you tonight you're mine   Didn't we have the time of our life tonight   Didn't we have the time of our life tonight   Hey, I hope you feel the same way I feel   'Cause tonight the moon, the stars   This moment so real   To once we have everything   Our hearts have a song to sing   We now know that dream's come true   'Cause now there's me and you   Didn't we have the time of our life tonight?.And though I've cried out loud that two's a crowd      That don't convince my heart..I'm merely a man,   And I bring nothing but love for you..You, me   Understand   Shake my hand   Last chance, little man   Ain't it grand   It's a bargain, it's a steal   30 pieces of silver   And a deal's a deal      Sign upon the dotted line   I'll be yours and you'll be mine   Nothing's free   Eventually   Nothing's free      From the rules and laws of morality   Free to take your fill   Free from your own free will   Nothing's free      My boy, it's getting late   I'll raise the stakes   So close   Control your fate, why hesitate   Seal the deal, close the sale   Take my hammer, drive the nail      Sign upon the bloody line   A drop of yours, a drop of mine   Nothing's free   Eternally   Nothing's free      From your conscience or   Free from the consequence   Free to sin and death   Free till your final breath   Nothing's free   Free from the claws and flaws of your family   Free from obedient life   You're cut like a double-edged knife   Nothing's free, nothing's free   Oh, you pay me      Free to ignore the bore of authority   Free to spit in the face   Be the winningest rat in the race till Judgement Day   Then nothing's free   Bow to me if you want to be free   Free from life, come die with me   And when we're dead it's for eternity      Come on little one and dance in the fire   The heat's getting close   and the flame's getting higher   When the music's over there's a hush in the choir   Nothing's free   When the trumpets sound   and his light is all around   And the saints all raise from the graves   in the ground   We'll be going way downtown   Way downtown.He could go 'Zoop!.Stop me, oh, stop me   Stop me if you think that you've   Heard this one before   Stop me, oh, stop me   Stop me if you think that you've heard this one before      Nothing's changed   I still love you, oh, I still love you   ...

"Have you ever walked into a library and saw a book that you wouldn't what your child or any young one to pick up and read? There is several book in the library that young children should read. I don't believe that you a certian book should be removed from the library because it is offensive to some or not suitable for children, but there is a few things that can be done to keep those books away from your kids or any child. The possable things that could be done is; move those book to a higher shelf, designate a certian area for those books, or put an age limit on those books.     The first way that you could keep an offensive book out of your childs, or any other childs hands is to move those book to a higher shelf. Doing this will keep those books out of your childs sight and reach. That will keep them out of childens hand, and prevent them from reading them.     The next possability to keep offensive books out of your childs or any childs hand is to, designate a certain area for those books in the library. Doing this will provied a 'barrior', so that you could tell your child to stay out of that area, and keep a watch on them to make sure they don't go in that area. You would also know where those books are so the you could make sure they don't go to that area.     The final possability to keep offensive books out of your childs or any other childs hands is to put an age limit on those book to keep the children from being able to check-out those books, to read them. This would make the childen have be a certain age before the can check them out, preventing them from reading them.      These are a few possabilities that could be used to keep offisive books out of childrens hands, and preventing them from reading those offensive books that you wouldn't want them getting a hold of and reading.Yes you are!.I clapped when I saw her   When I found her, you split   When I'm on the go, you know I'm legit      (I mean, I was really legit, up on the go that night)   (Ah you were, know I'm

keep on saying 'Go slow!'.But, oh God,   Under the weight of life,   Things seem brighter on the other side..You know that old trees just grow stronger,   And old rivers grow wilder every day,   But old people, they just grow lonesome   Waiting for someone to say,   ""hello in there..She thinks all my jokes are corny   Convict movies make her horny   She likes ketchup on her scrambled eggs   Swears like a sailor when shaves her legs   She takes a lickin'   And keeps on tickin'   I'm never gonna let her go..Cannot hear what your saying   Could I tell you so   And I can't believe my troubles   And I'm going home      Lie and sleep   Under deep   You know      While the cold winter waitin'   While it's turning cold   All these things we were searchin'   Now we just don't know      Lie and sleep   Under deep   I think you know      For the rhymes of an hour   Now I'm going home   And I can't believe I'm nothing   'Cause I'm coming down      Lie and sleep   Under deep   Do you know?"
"Many people have different views on censorship. Some people believe there are movies, books, newspapers, etc that contain subject matter that is not appropriate for some viewers and that they should keep their writing on certain things to a certain extent or not at all. Other people believe people have the right to say what they want when they want, on a topic they believe the be true or not true, or very improtant to them, also called freedom of speech. Also people believe that yes, there are some things written out there that should not have been written but they have no control over and to some people it @MONTH1 be appropriate.      I do believe there are stories written that are not appropriate. But I know that even though I find the subject to not be appropriate or of any use to me, another person will. I know that every person out there is different and has their own beliefs on different things. If people had the power to control what books, magazines, newspapers and movies were in libraries then @PERSON1 was right, 'We would have no books left on the shelf for any of us'.           Certain books, newspapers, movies, and magazines could help certain people and be of interest to certain people no matter what the subject is or how inappropraite it @MONTH1 be as long as they are along the right age. If the story is plainly about drugs, sex, alcohol, and voilence with really no use to it, then yes I do believe it should be taken off the shelf. You do not know who could get their hands on that movie, book, or article. It could be a little kid and we do not want to open the door for that. People have many different beliefs and I do believe we should not take anything off the shelf that could be of use to anyone, but I also do believe there is a certain extent..You can never go home any more..presidential shit george bush(GEORGE BUSH!).There is something I wanted to tell you,   It's so funny you'll kill yourself laughing   But then I, I look around,   And I remember that I am alone,   Alone..(Retribution)   I can't hear ya, time ta meet my lord   I can't hear ya, talk to, talk to 2 by 4   She don't take no more'.If where you're coming from, is where you've already been,   And What's happening brother has happened,   And why am I is the reason why I am, please tell me,   What it what you is?.I'm gonna be, gonna be,   I'm gonna be a hot dancer!.I got back what I gave   Which only made me worse,   I had to have my way   Which was bleak and gray..Petrified?.Don't make this harder than it is,   We both knew it'd come to this..Raining down on me..On Lover's Island   Where the trees stand so tall   And the dust turn to gold   And love never grows old      On Lover's Island   Where the birds sing of love   Seems a gift from up above   I met her one day   (Met her one day)      As we stood alone on the mountain   Under the moon and stars above   Oh, darling, don't ever go   She was Venus, the goddess of love      On Lover's Island   Where the trees stand so tall   And the dust turn to gold   And love never, never   Never, never grows old.Chorus: I will praise your name and I will bless you always I will praise your name today I will sing and shout it I will tell the world about it I will praise your name today      Verse: I made my decision no turning back for me oh all glory I'm giving you're Lord of everything your mercy you grace has guarded me oh my master my Savior you're Lord of everything      Vamp: I live to praise I praise to live I live to praise forever and ever I will praise you.(and soak up lots of pain), yeah   Little junior on the bus--his notebook by his side, yeah   He hardly ever makes a fuss--he soaks up so much pain   We've traveled far this monkey and me--by airplane boat and train, yeah   We're here to eat up all your sins (and soak up all your pain), yeah   (Chorus)   Boys and girls of every creed--religion and persuasion, nooo   It's time to get up off your knees...we soak up...soak it up   So open the door and let me in--don't question who I am, no   Just shake my hand and give me your name (we soak up...soak it up...).Gee, baby, ain't I good to you?.Though I'd go out of mind but for you   I'd go out of my mind but you      Lying in a mother's arms   the primal root of a woman's charms..This is not your country      I need some air   And I'm stopped and repeatedly questioned:   ""Born and braised?"".This is your life and you do what you want to do,   Just don't hurt nobody,   'less of course they ask you,   In the garden of earthly delights..New times..What's your name?.Shut up!.We dam the streams, we raid the shacks,   And hide in boxcars on the tracks..You're still young, that's your fault,   There's so much you have to know."
"Some people believe that certain materials, such as books, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive. However, I do not believe they should be removed. People are mature enough to be able to handle offensive material. Most people check out books or movies that they have heard about, so for the most part they know what they are reading @MONTH1 be offensive. Instead of removing the ofensive material, there should just be a warning to let readers know that what they are checking out is considered offensive.           These days, people are mature enough to read offensive material. We see many types of offensive material every day. Examples of this inlcude when we watch the news, we @MONTH1 see numerous offensive pictures or videos. There are also many news stories that many people consider offensive. When a person checks out an offensive book, they are doing so because they want to. Libraries should not revoke a reader's right to read what he/she wants.           Before a person checks out a book or movie, they should look into it to make sure they are okay with what they are getting. This can prevent many problems. For example, say a young reader sees a book that they think looks interesting. If they don't read into it a little bit and just take it home, they @MONTH1 later find that it contains offensive material. However, if they read a little bit about it before they check it out, they will find out it contains offensive material, and can then make the decision on whether or not they still want to read it.           There are many ways libraries can prevent children or other people not mature enough to view the offensive material from seeing it. They can put a warning label on the book or movie to inform people that that particular item is considered offensive. Libraries could even put an age limit on checking out offensive material. Either of these ideas could be an efffective way to ensure that only mature people are checking out anything that is considered to be ofensive.     Libraries should not have to remove books, music, movies, magazines, etc. that contain offensive material from the shelves. If a person wants to check out a book that is offensive, they should be allowed to check it out and read it. Also, people should be intelligent enough to look into whatever item they are checking out before hand so they can be aware of the offensive material. However, to make things even easier, libraries could just put a warning label on offensive material to prevent some people from reading it..From di gyal dem look pon me!.You hit the street, you feel them staring   You know they hate you you can feel their eyes a glarin'   Because you're different, because you're free   Because you're everything deep down they wish they could be   [Chorus:]   You're lookin back (lookin back) they're lookin back (lookin back)   Too many people lookin back   You're lookin back (lookin back) they're lookin back (lookin back)   Too many people lookin back   They watch the news, see young men dying   They watch them bleedin' and listen to them lyin'   And if they're normal if they can see   They just reach out and change the channel on the TV   [Chorus]   When they could vote, and end the war   They're much too busy fittin' locks upon the back door   Give you a foxhole, a place to hide   Cause when the war come the cops'll be on their side   [Chorus].I'm just a man   My will is so strong   When I've got plans   I close my eyes to the pain   My mother ran   My father left town   But we still have   What's necessary to go on   Flesh and blood   Flesh and blood      I'm part of you   You're part of me   There's nothing said   That cannot be undone      My brothers sane   His heart is so strong   He's killed some pain   To himself nearly did the same   It washed away   Into the cruel sea   Like everything   That's built upon the sand      Flesh and blood   Flesh and blood      Sweet sister T   She loved so long and hard   Kept to herself   Until that right man came along   Some men they lie   Some men they cheat   But now she's found   Someone to be as strong      I'm just a man   My will is so strong   When I've got plans   I close my eyes to the pain   My Father ran (Flesh and blood)   My Mother left town   But we still have (Flesh and blood)   What's necessary to go on      I'm part of you   Your part of me.I seen another soldier who got wasted in the war   He said he left his soul there overseas   The notion he defended doesn't matter anymore   And circumstance had brought him to his knees   We sat there in the silence of a cold and empty room   Down the hall I heard a baby cry   He looked up from the potion he was cooking in a spoon   And nailed me with the anger in his eye   Chorus:   He said, do you really believe in freedom ?.Forever can never be long enough for me   Feel like I've had long enough with you   Forget the world now we won't let them see   But there's one thing left to do      Now that the weight has lifted   Love has surely shifted my way   Marry me   Today and every day   Marry me   If I ever get the nerve to say   Hello in this cafe   Say you will   Mm-hmm   Say you will   Mm-hmm      Together can never be close enough for me   Feel like I am close enough to you   You wear white and I'll wear out the words I love you   And you're beautiful   Now that the wait is over   And love and has finally shown her my way   Marry me   Today and every day   Marry me   If I ever get the nerve to say hello in this cafe   Say you will   Mm-hmm   Say you will   Mm-hmm      Promise me   You'll always be   Happy by my side   I promise to   Sing to you   When all the music dies      And marry me   Today and everyday   Marry me   If I ever get the nerve to say hello in this cafe   Say you will   Mm-hmm   Say you will   Mm-hmm   Marry me   Mm-hmm.No I wouldn't have nothing,   If I didn't have you..I really want the sun,   Want the sun to rise,   I really want   To end the night..I've never really asked you for anything, no..Gardener: We've got Annie?.I finally found someone, that knocks me off my feet   I finally found the one, that makes me feel complete   We started over coffee, we started out as friends   It's funny how from simple things, the best things begin      This time it's different, dah dah dah dah   It's all because of you, dah dah dah dah   It's better than it's ever been   'Cause we can talk it through   Oh, my favorite line was ""Can I call you sometime?"".Hold turns to dust, shattered by light..Oesn't matter if it's day or night   'Cause we're all gonna pay the price..I've been fine""      Please come out tonight, let's go out and see the world   We can try to find, find somewhere   It seems so long ago, I can hardly remember the time   It's all I want, it's all I want, so let's see what we find      You'll say ""there's so much you need to know""   I'll say ""are you really sure you have to go?"".I'm ashamed of the things I've been put through,   I'm ashamed of the person I am..Ain't seen a day, that I don't hear people say, they know they're gonna' die..(Didn't he do it, well didn't he?).I wont soothe your pain   I wont ease your strength      Drake:   I should let you fall in love with   Someone else girl   I live in L.

"Is there enough censorship in our libraries? Have you ever came across a vulgar or offensive book in your library and hoped that no children had ever read it? Well that should never happen,  if a book or any other material is offensive then it should be put in a seperate area of the library where only adults can access it. Other than that section their should not be any offensive or vulgar materials that children or even early teenagers should be able to see.      Almost everyday children and teenagers have access to offensive and vulgar materials that could have terrible effects on them. Maybe if they do not see these offensive materials when they are young they will be less likely to use or engage in some of the things that they see or read. For example when teenagers read about people doing drugs that could influence them to engage in those type of activities as well. The materials might not have an effect right away but later on down the road it could have a giant effect on them.     The youth is what is going to be running this country when we are old. So we need to do our part and take offensive and vulgar materials out of the reach of our children and teenagers. I do not want my children to read some of the things that I read when I was young. That is why I believe their should be censorship in every library..Oh baby, baby   Oh baby, baby      Oh baby, baby, how was I supposed to know   That something wasn't right here   Oh baby, baby, I

"When you walk into your local library there are thousands of books, magazines, movies, etc. You have different types and styles of books. There are fiction and nonfiction, comedy, horror, children books, and many more. Also what you might not know is some libraries have books that are either sexual, violent, disruptive, and aren't appropriate for young children. They could also have movies and magazines like that and that is not a good influence.     When a young child walks into a library, they would expect to find a book with color, action, pictures, etc. But while they're browsing around they could run into a certain book thats not meant for them and they could end up becoming influenced. A book that is inappropriate for a child could possibly affect a childs life because they could go out into reality and try to immitate a book they have read and it could end up being the wrong decision.     Inappropriate movie and magazines, such as pornagraphic magazines or pictures, rated @CAPS1 or @CAPS2 movies, shouldn't be allowed in a library. Items like that should be sold in a separate store. Items like these are meant for adults only. We should try to inspire our young children to do whats right and not try to convince them to do anything in a negative way. If you are going to have any of these items kept in your home, then keep them in a place where children can not find them.     The generation that we live in now, most young people only focus on gang violonce, sex, rap music, and drugs and you can find all of this material in movies, books, and songs. If we keep all of these negative minded items out of public places such as libraries and even homes, then there could possibly be some change. Most rap songs you hear these days are either talking about violence, sex, or drugs. Most music should have a positive message to it.      I feel if I see a book, movie, magazine, etc., sitting on a shelf where a young person can see it, I feel I should have the right to remove it because society is not like what it use to be and if we make a change like this, then I feel a few things can change. Eventhough I'm still young I feel my teenage generation should stop all the violence and stop becoming influenced by everything they see or hear, and if we focus on the more important things in life, then this world can be a whole different place..It was July hot 'cross Georgia on my way to myrtle beach   I just got my diploma so I set out in search of me   The honeymoon was over and Alabama was far away   From being little more than just a southern state      I got a gig down at the Bowery   I played for tip and watered drinks   Just a novice in a business   That's seldom what it seems      And where are you goin' tar top   Where's J.C. and the chosen few?.Mama used to say to me, you can make your destiny   Keep your feet planted on the ground   You can always get it back, make a castle from a one room shack   It's all of what you make of what you've found   Son you're gonna find out when you're older   There's always been the hand of God restin' right there on your shoulder   Will it be Hell or Heaven on earth the choice is up to you   Look to the sky, the answer is clear   Are you gonna, live life for all it's worth   Choose Hell, or Heaven on earth   If you live it right, there's nothing to fear   'Cause you'll find Heaven right here   Saw a man the other day, had it made in every way   Till his greed brought him down   He was blinded by the city lights, now he shivers in the cold tonight   Who will save the lifeguard when he's about to drown   Will it be Hell or Heaven on earth the choice is up to you   Look to the sky, the answer is clear   Are you gonna, live life for all it's worth   Choose Hell, or Heaven on earth   If you live it right, there's nothing to fear   'Cause you'll find Heaven right here   You know you're gonna walk through fire   You know your gonna feel the pain   You're gonna lose, if you want to win the game   And every time your heart is breakin'   And every time your faith is shaken   Remember what mama said that day   Hope when my time has come   I've left enough to build upon   Ain't no one gonna say, ""I didn't try""   Here's why   Hell or Heaven on earth the choice is up to you   Look to the sky, the answer is clear   Are you gonna, live life for all it's worth   Choose Hell, or Heaven on earth   If you live it right, there's nothing to fear   'Cause you'll find Heaven right here   You'll find Heaven right here   You'll find Heaven right here, Heaven right here.Have you already been here once or twice?.And she can hold my hand because she hates the dark..(study gets you high)   It takes you on a ride   You feel it when your   Brain starts to fry (brains start to fry)   Your social life will die (life will die)   And the books' are all you got (c'mon now)   This must be...

found   And I believe that everyone should get what they're allowed   Suspected of belief that comes suspended   In a sound and everybody wants some      It's the sound they make in heaven, it's a sound for here on earth   I've heard it in the whispering of the wonders that we search   We've waited far too long to hear the healing of the stars   'N' everybody wants some      Everybody wants some   Everybody wants some   Everybody wants some   Everybody wants some   To feel alive      Oh, does it get much better than this   Oh, does it get much better, much better   Oh, does it get much better than this, than this      There's the sound that keeps you trying   There's the sound that makes you smile   There's a sound in every corner   Of the world that we survive      Your temple is the harmony, you feel the sacred ground   Just wishing for the secret to appear within the sound   Watching for the morning star, the rhythm of the sun   I hear it in my waking dreams, the singing has begun      The passion that we walk upon   The passion that we bring   Is written for the mountains   They love to hear us sing      Everybody wants some   Everybody wants some   Everybody wants some   Everybody wants some   To feel alive      Oh, doesn't get much better than this   Oh, doesn't get much better than this, than this      Who made me make believe   I'm alive I'm living   Never

turns in the door the boards squeak on the floor   And guilty footsteps linger on the hall   I'd fight but I'm too weak pretending I'm asleep   While hearing guilty footsteps in the hall      Guilty footsteps always wake me up at night when she comes in   Guilty footsteps tiptoe through my mind they tell me where she's been   True love has no pride but he's not satisfied   Unless he has her at his beck and call   I know now how he works so I'll fight dirt with dirt   To stop those guilty footsteps in the hall      Guilty footsteps always wake me up at night when she comes in   Guilty footsteps tiptoe through my mind they tell me where she's been   The next time she comes home she'll find herself alone   Then she can read the writing on the wall   I wonder if she'll take it or if she'll try to fake it   When she hears my guilty footsteps in the hall   Oh when she hears my guilty footsteps in the hall.Howl at the moon..Hey, I paid my dues, I've had my share of holes in the

 Who tells you fate supplies a mate   It's all bananas      They're writing songs of love, but not for me   A lucky star's above, but not for me   With love to lead the way I've found more skies of

   Although I can't dismiss   The memory of his kiss   I guess he's not for me.You started to take sides   They started arguing   He said it was her fault   She said it wasn't at all   But the truth lies somewhere in the middle..Take a look at me now..Oo-oo   Oo-oo, du, du, du, du, du, du, du."
"I think that certain things in libraries should be taken off shelves if found offensive but not all. One of these things is anything that undermines or degrades one's religious beliefs. Another thing could be anything involving racial stereotypes or obvious racial comments. Having anything containing this could spark conflict within or outside of the library. Another thing that could be, but not entirely, removed from library material could be books that express violent or criminal acts. This type of material should only be given to an older audience.     I think that anything that contains slander or judgement on another person's religious beliefs should be removed from library shelves. As time goes on people are taking religion more and more serious. With that being said I don't think anyone would want to read a book or watch a movie in which the things they believe in being made fun of or rejected. It @MONTH1 not seem like harmful material at first glance, but your opinion @MONTH1 change when your customers come back angry and frustrated about what they read and saw. It would be a better choice to avoid this conflict with your customers and keep this material out of your library, unless you want to deal with complaints and costant arguments.     Another thing that needs to be removed is racial material. Racism has been one the worlds largest problems, it affects us all no matter who it's against. Picture a book in your library that calls all black teens a problem or a book that says all arabians dangerous, racist isn't it? Now imagine if your customers were of one of those two ethnicities, it's not a good picture at all. Keeping these stereotypes and harmful sayings off library shelves is a great business choice and will keep all customers happy. The last thing we want is for a customer to say 'those people are racist!'.     Lastly I think books that express violent and criminal acts should be censored from minors. Kids always follow what they hear or what they see. Since they're still in that stage where they rarely do things in their own way they @MONTH1 mimic or copy things they see. Another problem that surrounds this is peer pressure which will get more and more children commiting these acts. If this is to happen many parents will become outraged and blame the libraries for relaeasing this material to children. So the best choice would be to keep this material away from minors, if it is contained within your library.While I am waiting   For someone to break my heart..Something is wrong with the picture   This is not my fault   So am I a sinner?.For you so      I don't care what other people say..Ooh, no wonder that I thought that they were going out of style   I just had to meet you to make Christmas

"Today, we all have a very large variety of books to choose from when we enter a library. Some are childrens books, while others are intended for a more mature reader. Many parents are scared that their child will read a book that @MONTH1 be inappropiate for their child. The thing is, if everyone removes the books that they don't find acceptable, there won't be any books left in the library for us to enjoy.     What makes a book unacceptable to read? Could it be language, graphic scenes, or parts that are just extremely scary? Many people think that books like these should not be available for anyone to read. Removing a book from a library would be done through one's opinion. This is not fair because we all have the right to free press, which means that anyone can publish anything they wish to and everyone has the right to read it. By removing books from a library, you are violating not only the author's right, but the reader's as well.      Unfourtunately, there are some books that @MONTH1 cause a child to become scared. When a child reads a book, it's harder for them to realize that they are just reading a book. Many children take in every word of a story and turn it into a reality. Not only can this scare a child, but it makes it extremely difficult to explain that what they read in the story is not true. As more and more of these books are released, the more likely it becomes that children will be reading these offensive stories.     I believe that removing books from a library based on opinion is wrong. I understand that leaving these types of books out for children to read could cause a problem, but libraries are usually set up in sections. For instance, there is a childrens section, a teen section, and an adult section. This helps kids remain in an area appropiate for their age. I think that if a parent is worried enough that their child will read an offensive book, then they should go with their child to the library when checking out books to read.     A public library is designed to accompany a vast variety of readers. There will always be certain books that some of us find offensive. Removing books from a library only decreases the number of books to choose from; and if that were to happen, there would eventually be no books left for anyone to enjoy..Each night he would find her there,   Swinging in the cocoanut tree,   And the monkey gay,   At the break of day,   Loved to hear his Chimpie say:      ""Aba, daba, daba, daba, daba, daba, dab,""   Said the Chimpie to the Monk,   ""Baba, daba, daba, daba, daba, daba, dab,""   Said the Monkey to the Chimp..I wasted my time when I wouldn't try, try, try..S-you-see-see-E-S-S   That's the way we spell success   Will we get it, the answers yes   S-you-see-see-E-S-S   Small town boy, so clean he squeaks   Dressed and polished for the big time dreams   Got a letter from his ma, and a boyish grin   Close his eyes one minute, and it'll lead him to the win, Yeah   You know there's nothin' like heaven that won't get you back   To you get your ass in gear, and your mind on track   When wheels start turnin', things start to fall into place   You'll be surprised what you can do and some talents all it takes   Yeah   Chorus:   Sometimes The Good Guys Finish First   Sometimes your best is all it takes   You know that, Sometimes The Good Guys Finish First   Sometimes The Good Guys, Finish First   Back on logic, turn your head around   Use the front door and avoid the crowds   They'll be tryin' to tell you that it can't be done   Cause the big boys on their own gave us half the fun, hey hey   (Repeat Chorus Twice)   The Good Guys, the Good Guys, the Good Guys, Finish First   (Chorus)   Sometimes The Good Guys Finish First   Walkin' a straight line in reverse   You know that, Sometimes The Good Guys Finish First   Sometimes The Good Guys, Finish First   (Chorus).Travelled and stained,   Soaked to the skin..I'm me!.(Just have fun), wanna,   Play you like a game boy..I got bills to pay and children who need clothes   I know there's fish out there but God only knows,   They say these waters aren't what they used to be   But I got people back on land who count on me..I wrap my arms around your naked shoulders,   take cover for the night..Get them boyz      (lilc) get them boyz nigga..N   Y la mirada se llena de recuerdos que la vida nos dej?..[Cornelius:]   ...

"In libraries there should be a control over what certain kind of books, magazines, or movies that children should be able to read.  For instance movies, are we going to go let a @NUM1 year watch a rated @CAPS1 movie much less let him/her watch a porn movie. No thats just plain wrong. That goes with magazines and books. Magazines have some images that aren't appropriate for the right age bracket that can easily pick it up and look at it.  Books as well kids have very imaginative minds, they @MONTH1 not have pictures in them but still kids know a little more than what we give them credit for.     Me, I would know this because as a little kid my brothers got a rated @CAPS1 film called '@CAPS3's @CAPS4'. After watching all @NUM2 of the films that were available at the time, I just could not look at a doll the same way again.  Whenever my mom would get rid of a doll she used to own some of them had eyes that would move. I always sat at one side of the car while the doll would be as far away from me aas possible.     To prevent other kids from experiencing what I did local libraries ought to create sections in the library where you've got your children section, the teen section, and the adult section. So then you can easily tell the kids to only go to either the teen section or the kids section.  This should be the way to organize the films and magazines as well.  I know some people wouldnt agree with my ideas but I have to ask them in return. Do you have any better ideas?     Now for getting rid of stuff in our library that can be offensive. I would say we keep it, our kids need to know our culture that way they can survive in it. They need to know that there are still racists out there even though society tries to cover it up.  There's no way there going to be able to keep other people's opinions from coming ears length of the @CAPS3.  If our children are to grow up maturley they need to experience or at least know what bullying is.  Maybe learn what an athiest is or find out on their own what a sexist is.

"Most modern day book, movies, music, etc. do a fairly good job of placing warning in the form of '@CAPS1 @CAPS2' sticks on their covers. But books from before this practice began to happen @MONTH1 be found more offensive then books today. Why? Well, that's because many books of the past use words that today are found offensive. But those books, movies, and music are not at fault like parents try to make it seem. There are examples of how each catagory is in today's society.     Take the book 'The @CAPS3 of @ORGANIZATION1', written by @PERSON1, for example. In that story, there are words that are used to describe people of that time.. Back when @PERSON1 wrote the book, it was perfectly fine to use those words on those people, but in today's modern world, that is a book that has been on the list for being banned. It is offensive to use that word on people today, so parent groups and others are trying to get that book pulled off of shelves in hopes of erasing what was done in the past. I don't believe that a book should be banned for it's content, but rather how well it teaches its reader through its words. If it can teach a student in a high school or college class about the history and the culture of that time, then it shouldn't be banned at all. It should be read.     Movies have a rating system for a reason. There are some movies that are just not meant for a younger audience. People must be of a certain age to rent, buy, or view these kind of movies 'leagally'. Not too many people listen to that system, even though it has exsisted for years. A horror film is not suitable for a @CAPS15 of a young age who believes everything he or she sees on @CAPS4. Movies shouldn't be banned just because it gives a @CAPS15 nightmares or makes them not as emotionally aware of what is right or wrong. That is the fault of the parents. They were the ones who let their @CAPS15 watch that movie in the first place. So the movie shouldn't be held responsible for the @CAPS15. If the movie was intended for a more mature audience, that's the way it should stay.     And that brings us to music. There is a lot of music in today's age that can be considered very offensive. There are only a few 'pure' genres, free of the cursing that is used in many of the others today. But children, teen, and adults all find their favorite kind, and you can't change their minds then. The governement has issued that all music containing harsh words, horrid images to the mind, gruesome scenes, and other elements that are offensive to people, must carry a sticker on it. The black and white '@CAPS1 @CAPS2' sticker. When parents see this sticker on the @CAPS7, @NUM1 download, or whatever their @CAPS15 is using, then they know that it is more than likely not right for their @CAPS15 to listen to. Doesn't mean that the parent is actually going to listen all the time, but it means that there is a slight chance that their minds will not be tainted by 'garbage'.     So, in conclusion, I believe that movies, books, and music that contain 'offensive' material should not be removed from shelves. Just because it is offensive to one person doesn't neccessarily mean that it is the same to another person. There are ratings on things for a reason, to keep children from seeing them and to help with the level of harshness that is given to today's society. People will still argue that books such as 'The @CAPS3 of @ORGANIZATION1', 'The @CAPS3 of @PERSON2', '@CAPS10 in the @CAPS11', and many, many more books like them should be banned. They will always fight that movies such as 'A @CAPS12 on @CAPS13 @CAPS14,' '@DATE1 the @NUM2', or '@CAPS15's @CAPS16' should be removed from store shelves because it gave them nightmares as a @CAPS19 or it gives their @CAPS15 nightmares because they saw it. And they will always try to fight and say that artist like @CAPS17' @CAPS18, @LOCATION1, and @CAPS19 @CAPS20 are not suited for their @CAPS15. Well, this pattern has been going on for years. Those books were made many years before, those movies are intended for a adult audience, not for a @CAPS15 of a young age, and those artists are just trying to make money like everyone else. So when parents try to argue about what should be on shelves and what should not, remember that it might be that parent's fault for letting their @CAPS15 view it in the first place..You're a picture of love..Well, I can't help the way I talk, I wouldn't change it if I could..Everybody says it's going to take a little time   Might as well get used to her running through my mind   Her memory

"Cencorship is a very large thing to talk about. Some people think that a book has too much talking about sex in it, while others think that it is sutable for the public. Sometimes people want other people to make the decitions on what they read. People need to decide what they do and don't want to read and see.      Firstly, people think that other people are incable of deciding for them selves what they want to read. They blocked books because they thought that it would show a side of things to children that they did not want them to see. The @CAPS1 @CAPS2 books were block because they had witchcraft and they were scared that people were going to start trying to do it. Grapes of @CAPS3 was banded because their was slavery in it. Even though slavery was a big thing they still did not want any of the younger people to have it.      Secondly, some music and movies should be banned. Music has become a way for people to express them selves. Latily they have gotten to the point that drugs and 'hos' are alright to talk about. One song that I just saw was called @CAPS4 @CAPS5 @CAPS6 @CAPS7. Now if that is not sending a bad message than I don't know was is a good message. Movies are in the same boat as music. They are showing the violence that people only have in their head. @PERSON1 was a movie that off the top of my head was showing a minner that had gone completly blood thursty and was killing any one that went in his cave, just because he could.      Although, somethings we need to see the things that people have in @CAPS8 heads. I know that I am going to be more carful when I am out.      In conclution, @CAPS8 is no real yes or no anser. @CAPS8 is always exceptions to whatever people say. This is why people need to decide what they do and don't watch and read.What?.The field is cut and bleeds too red,   The cannon balls fly 'round my head,   The infirmary man may count me dead,   When

"Do you think that certain materials should be removed off library's bookselfs if someone dislikes or does not agree with the topic or the plot? Do you believe that a book should be banned from any public library just because someone has a negative opinion about what the book is convincing readers?     I believe that every person has the choice to not read a book or magazine, or even watch a movie, if they find it offensive.     'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the self. But if I have the right to remove that book from the self- that work I abhor- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no book left on the self for any of us.' @CAPS1 quote from the arthur, Katherine Paterson, from my opinion, I believe that what she is saying is very true. Considering that everyone has a different opinion on many things, if everyone had a right to remove one book that they did not like or felt it was offensive from the self, there would not be a varity of books for people to choose from. I have sometimes gotten corious about what a friend was reading and asked them if they thought it was a good book. They either tell me it is a good novel or tell me it was horrible. Then I would read a few pages and I would think it was pretty good. So if they had the right to remove that book I would have never got the chance to read that book.     I do not believe that people should be able to remove books from shelfs just on their specific personality. Everyone has a different opinion or perspective about books. Everyone should get a large variety.Generals and Majors ah ah   They're never too far   From battlefields so glorious   Out in a world of their own   They'll never come down   Till once again victorious      Generals and Majors always   Seem so unhappy 'less they got a war      Generals and Majors ah ah   Like never before are tired of being actionless..Everything I think I need, it all begins to seem   So small in the Presence of you..Major Monogram: All rightly then..Si es verdad que tu eres guapa   Yo te voy a poner gozar   Tu tiene la boca grande   Dale ponte a jugar, como?.I held a party and nobody came   Strangely I was upset   Poured out a drink and then Birkworth approached saying   ""Have no regrets..Hurry up and wait!.Boy, I feel so outgunned today   But I'll get up and fight back, anyway   You and I are not huge mainstream stars   But unlike them, we're really what we are      We got Main Street eyes   Watchin' as the big boys roll by   Under rotten television skies   We got Main Street eyes      I saw a kitten squashed in the street   I read about a plastic surgeon and his art collection..bye, little girl, bye, bye, little girl   Bye..is all in time   With these hands built this life   Hands of mine now I'm alive   Just can't hide from my self   Just can't hide from my self   I just can't hide from my self   Just can't hide from my fuckin' self      I can't hide   I can't hide   And I can't hide   And I can't hide   Cause I just can't be myself   Cause I just can't fuckin' be myself   And I just can't hide from myself   Every time it's just myself      I can't hide from my fuckin' self   I wanna peel my skin hang it on the shelf   Die from no pain   A minimal brain   Damn I'm like an idiot when I go insane   Too impulsive too impatient   Anxiety's got me screamin' this hatred   Still I strive to stay alive   Gotta get mine cause I just can't be myself      Cause I just can't fuckin' be myself   And I just can't hide from myself   Every time it's just myself      Is there some future?.Tonight, tonight, won't be just any night,   Tonight there will be no morning star   Tonight, tonight, I'll see my love tonight..Perfect   Yo girl flirtin cuz my chain perfect   Watch and ring perfect   Earrings perfect   She is misses perfect and I am mr.

"Hi, my name is mason and i'm writing about wether we should take books off the self and etc. People have differnt views on differnt things.     Books, books give a differnt form of lerning to differnt people.I personal don't learn from books as well as I do from the internet or tv but books are nice to have every once in a great while. Eeryone like to sit down and read a good book every once in a while.     Music doesn't really teach you anything, it relaxs you in differnt ways. Some people might learn from listening to music but i'm not one of those peole. It influnce you to get movited, say your getting ready for a football game and you want to get hyped up for it, well some music can get you hyped up for that game.     When i sit down and watch a movie I can learn from it cause i have the patien to sit down and watch it, to learn from it but that is just me other people have differnt ways of learning but the best way for me is to watch movies. They get stright to the point and don't waste time telling you stuff you alredy know.     Magazines are helpful to they have short artcicles that get stright to the point too, and that is what I like about magazines and movies. Even though there are very few magazines that give out helpful information, the ones that do help out alot.     So I think that music should be taken off shelves because they don't really teach you alot but books, movies, and magazine do help you to a certian point. It is up the other people to decide wether music should be taken off the shelves not just one person cause music might help other people in differnt ways not just one way but many ways too.Jungle fever, jungle fever, jungle fever, jungle fever..Did-n-did-n-did-n-dum   Army dreamers   Did-n-did-n-did-n-dum   ""Mammy's hero""   ""B.F.P.O."".come to your house, why' know he don't stay long,   Why' look in bed this morning,   Children you find that your brothers and sisters are gone..Let it all come down tonight..They want you!.You are?.When she learns of all your lyin',   Would she join you there...

"@CAPS1 are many prespectives on censorship in our country. Thats just how our country is we have different oppinions on everything we do. But we have to live with it, @CAPS1 are many different prespectives that come from old, young, parents, and children. In libraries @CAPS1 are some books,music, etc that @MONTH1 be offensive to people.     But we all have different oppinions therefore we can never listen to one pupil. Or it would start a fight between people that disagree with him/her. I think people that go into the library should be mature about what goes on in @CAPS1 otherwise they shouldn't be in @CAPS1 looking at whatever they are wanting to read about.          The library is opened for the public and has lots of knowledge it shares with us. But if we get rid of all the censorship then it denies people knowledge. The books that they would get rid of would be because of the children. Because parents don't want children to look @NUM1+ material that is not appropriate for them so they try to keep it hidden.     I think we should keep censorship around because it would deny knowledge to people if we did not keep it. And we should remind parents that some things in the library is not suitable for childrens eyes and let them be responsable for what thier children look at..Do you remember me   I sat upon your knee   I wrote to you   With childhood fantasies   Well, I'm all grown up now   Can you still help somehow      I'm not a child   But my heart still can dream   So here's my lifelong wish   My grown-up Christmas list   Not for myself   But for a world in need      No more lives torn apart   That wars would never start   And time would heal all hearts   Every man would have a friend      That right would always win   And love would never end   This is my grown-up   Christmas list   What is this illusion called      The innocence of youth   Maybe only in their blind belief   Can we ever find the truth   There'd be no more lives torn apart   And wars would never start      And time would heal all hearts   Every man would have a friend   And right would always win   And love would never end      This is my grown-up Christmas list   This is my only lifelong wish   This is my grown-up Christmas list.Cocky rocky, the rock and roll star   He's got the talent to take him far   Started out playing hotel bars   Cocky rocky, the rock and roll star      Spent his time just looking for kicks   Whipping out them tricks to pull the chicks   Just have a chance every way he rips   Come on rocky take me into the night      The neon streets are shining bright   To all them queens you bring the light   That cocky rocky   His belt is so tight      Hits the stage, the show begins   Dressed in black to make him thin   The speed they flash and when he grins   Sail away rocky and nobody sings (?).A distant uncle passed away and left me quite a batch   And I was livin'g high until that fatal day   A lawyer proved I wasn't born   I was only hatched..Can you taste it?.Yeah   Yeah   Yeah      'Cause you are (you are)   My fault (my fault)   As you are (you are)   My own   And you built (you built)   My guilt   But when I can, you just never will      Yeah   Yeah   Yeah      Yeah   Yeah   Yeah      'Cause you are (you are)   My fault (my fault)   You are (you are)   My own   It's your will (your will)   And my guilt..How ya gonna fuck with the juggla Jay-ay-ay   There he sits so I knock on the door   Pops opened up, pops hit the floor   Then I chop chop pops twice in his nugget   Well, he didn't do shit, fuck it   It's the murder go round      Well, it's me and my mellow mellow roll on Military   Gangbangers gangbangers, big bang fairy, kinda scary   Tags up all on the bricks   Latin Count, X-Men, CFP and all that shit   We love gangbangers and we hope they love us back   We just some wicked clowns and it's been like that   I don't understand why some people in town   We witness your water still southwest down   But this motherfucker gonna try and clown me   But I'm the juggalugalocoro, G   Took a shot and he missed, 2 Dope in the dust   ""What I ain't got shot, bitch?.I don't wanna be your slave..Painted lady, stop that closin' in on me,   Painted lady, you're supposed to be a dream,   Painted lady, you better stay away from me..What the hell am I?.Looks like it's daybreak,   But it feels like it's heartache..No hoes..No!.She took me to the snow capped mountains...

"I do not think that a random stranger should have the right to decide what books to allow in a public library. If they have a problem with certain material in certiain books they should bring it to the attention of the library. The auther who wrote that book has the freedom of speech, and they are allowed to write anything that they would like to write. If somebody did not want their children looking at a book, or reading that book, then they should just tell their child to stay away from it, and if they raised their child properly, he or she should respect those boundries that the parents have set.     However, I think there should be a line drawn about what is too graphic to be displayed at a public library. Some magazines that contain graphic material are very educational, such as @ORGANIZATION1. On the other hand, I am not saying that we should be lining shelves with @CAPS1 magazines either. There is a difference between having books that educate children about other cultures, and those that educate them about sex and explicit material. It is the adults job to protect their children from material such as that. But they can do it in another way, other than taking the book off the shelf.     Even if the book is filled with drugs or nudity, the concerned parent cannot just take actions into their own hands. The owner of the library is the adult that gets to decide what types of books or magazines he or she allows in the library, not the customers. I think that if you are offended by a certain book at a library, you should bring it to the attention of the owner, or simply go to a different library. If the owner refuses to remove the item from the shelf and the material offends you that much, you could go to court and plead your case to the judge.

"Do you agree with me that we should be aloud to read, listen to or view what we want? I think it is unfair that the schools have the right to tell us what we can look at the right is ours this is america and we have the right to do what ever we want. I think we should have the choice to read it and if it is offensive then dont read it becuase it might be offensive to you but not everyone thinks it is volgare or rude and obsene.      I am asking you the paper to stick up with me and fight the school and tell them what they should be aloud to read because it is not right to censor good material just because some nut job does not like it.

"I believe that profanity has a good side and a bad side. The good side is profanity is it give books, music, and movies taste and texteure it shows how a person feels most times it's anger. Profanity also can change a person behavior, by the way people talk and act. I personally think that profanity is a good and bad i like it in music and movies but i hate it when people talk trash. I think they should take it off the shelves depending on the person age for example age three and thirteen books should not contain profanity but ages fourteen and up can.           The reason why people should take it off the shelves is beacuse kids should have a healthy and profanity free life. They should have a a good development turds learning. Books and other intertaiment should have no profanity because kids at a young age learn easly and if they take in the bad actions of others they will be bad themselfs. The reason why people should be aware of this problem is if you don't like profanity dont buy it. Also keep out of kids reach. The main reason why people swears is because of movies and songs it changes a person dramaticly. Talking with profanity in your mouth can change your life but not having a good job getting in jail raising up bad kids that learn from the parents mistakes.      In a @CAPS1 profanity is good for movies it gives it action and drama. profanity is words that are most times negative expressing anger and rudeness. We have a @CAPS2 full of profanity this is like a wide spred deases. Passing on from people to kids to their kids. I have expeariance this the hard way beacuse im chinese and i came to the united states back in @DATE1, i did not know any english. People would cuss at me all the time the could all be avoided if we didnt have any profanity in our daily usage of books, music, and movies. I have learned alot about people by the way they talk letting me know who to stay away from. We should keep profanity but limit it from kids. Profanity is like ice cream people wants it and other dont. People could make there choice of putting themselfs in a profanity free life. people can do what they think is the right thing to do. Taking it off the shelves for kids is what i think is the right thing to do but not adults.     Due to profanity people tend to put themselfs in truble. For example some people in the use gets pulled over by a officer for a low cost speeding ticket but then they would swear at the officer putting them selfs in more truble this could all be avoided if he didnt have ever said anything. Profanity could also make a good motivational speech i know this beacuse im on the @LOCATION1 football team. Before every game our coach would motivate us by giving us a speech to get us pumped up with profanity in it. So in the end what im saying is porfanity should say but keep it out of reach of kids for books parents dont buy them if you dont want your kids to see them. Movies read the lable on the back of the @CAPS3 and see the agae limit and for profanity. Lock up the @ORGANIZATION1 shows that have profanity in it so your kids have no acess to them. If you dont want any part of profanity you can make yourself to stayway from it. We all know the there is nothing you can do about others useing profanity just dont use it yourself and stay clean do what you think is right.Baby I want you..Whoa-uh-oh   It's always a good time

"When it comes to my idea of having censorship in the libraries around the world I believe that there are cases when there are books, music, movies, magazines, etc., that should not be on the shelves. Not only are there things in the books, etc. that children might not understand and take the wrong way, but there are also things that adults of any age might take offensivley as well.     In my years of being in school I have encountered many books, music, movies, magazines, etc., that I have thought should never even end up on the shelves of libraries. For one example, I was looking through the library one day for a book that I would be able to do my book report on, and just from reading the back of the book I learned that this book involved drugs, sex, and many other things that I thought would be inappropriate for someone even my age to read. For the librarians and other school workers involved in the buying of books, I am sure that they never even think twice about a book being offered to young children and teenagers that it would be inapropriate or offensive, but in almost all cases every single book has something that would prove them wrong.     Also I have encountered offensive behavior while reading a book that was said to be a wonderful book even for someone under the age of twelve. In my own experience from reading the book I would have to say that these people are crazy and should reevaluate the the specific age they market to. Not only are there books that I have found in the library to be inappropriate and offensive but also many magazines, movies, and music. There is usually not alot of music that would involve offensive behavior in libraries but in some cases there are. For example, I new someone that was doing a report on pop culture and while researching the music and listening to the music that the library provided, they found it to be very offensive and inappropriate for himself to hear. Other than that I have found that movies and magazines are just as bad as books when it comes to being offensive.     I myself would think that teenagers above the age of @NUM1 would understand the meaning of being mature. I have observed that most teenagers and even children that read offensive books end up having a behavior that most parents and teachers do not approve of. When it comes time for my children to reach this age I would hope that they would never act like some of the kids I have seen or spoken with.     After understanding how much inappropriate/offensive behavior there is in books, music, movies, magazines, etc., I not only recommend that they evaluate the type of books, and other resources that are offered in libraries, but also I have realized that I sure hope they get this matter taken care of right away. I not only feel that parents around the world would feel the same as I do, but I know for a fact that I would never want my children to read books that I have read or been offered through my high school library. This is a very serious matter that all teachers and parents should realize when they recommend books to children and even teenagers. The world is becomming more and more violent every single day, and it is up to the future children to solve this problem. In a sitaution like this, we do not want the minds of the youth to be infested with offensive and inappropriate behavior. Let this be a step in the right direction.Crazy rhythm, here's the doorway   I'll go my way, you'll go your way   Crazy rhythm, from now on, we're through      Here is where we have a showdown   I'm too high and you're too low down   Crazy rhythm, here's goodbye to you      They say that when a high brow meets a low brow   Walking along Broadway   Soon the high brow, he has no brow   Ain't it a shame and you're to blame      What's the use of our mission   You produce the same condition   Crazy rhythm, I've gone crazy too      They say that when a high brow meets a low brow   Walking along Broadway   Soon the high brow, he has no brow   Ain't it a shame and you're to blame      What's the use of prohibition   You produce the same condition   Crazy rhythm, I've gone crazy too   Crazy rhythm, I've gone crazy too   Crazy rhythm, I've gone crazy too.But now she lives down by the ocean   She's takin' care to look for sharks..Guess I've got that old travelin' bone   'Cause this feeling won't leave alone..Life was such a simple game,   A child could play..No matter where I go, London, Paris, Mexico..I'm a battleship, frozen by my mothers anger   Anchored in the North Pole Sea   I'm a sphinx, stamped on the Hilton poster   Hoping to see the desert      I'm a woman without country or state   Opening her head to the universe   Hundred thousand people in me   Everyday they're growing, everyday they're feeling      He's an infant, blinded from his mothers sorrow   Crawling in the bleeding sky   He's a building, floating in spring air   Hoping to open his windows      He's a man, bound on earth soil   Reaching his hands to the universe   Hundred thousand people in him   Everyday they're feeling, everyday they're growing      Growing pain, growing joy   Growing pain, growing joy   Growing together   Reaching each other      Growing pain, growing joy   Growing pain, growing joy   Growing together   Reaching each other.And I've seen you in the cities   I've seen you on the road   And your face is all a-twisted   'cause your brain is a heavy load   And then you turn and ask me   Say how will I ever know   And you talk of all your searchin'   But I think it's all for show      Open up my friend   Love someone if you can   Go on, let her in   Open up again..Little darling,   It's been a long, long lonely winter   Little darling,   It seems like years since it's been here      Here comes the sun   Here comes the sun and I say   It's all right      Little darling,   The smiles are returning to their places   Little darling,   It seems like years since they've been there      But here comes the sun   Here comes the sun and I say   It's all right      Little darling,   I see the ice is slowly melting   Little darling,   It seems like years since they've been there      And here comes the sun   There goes the snow and I say   It's all right   It's all right      I see the ice is slowly melting   Little darling,   It seems like years since they've been there      Here comes the sun   There goes the snow and I say   It's all right   It's all right      Little darling,   The smiles are returning to their places   Little darling,   It seems like years since they've been there      Here comes the sun   I said here comes the sun and I say   It's all right.All the players came from far and wide   Wearing Afros and braids in every gangster ride   Now I'm here to tell yeah there's a better day   When the player ball is happenin' all day every day      Ain't no chimminies in the ghetto so I won't be hangin' my socks on no   Tip how far does it tick fix me a drink I got the remedy so bring in   That ham (not!).No need to worry, no need to turn away   Cause it don't matter, anyway, baby      [Chorus]   Oooh, I miss you in a heartbeat..Oh this can't be in vain   And I'm gonna tell you one just more time, yeah, yeah!.Is this freedom?.Keep them other girls at bay,   Oh, I would blow them all away..In another rhyme beyond this place..And I thought I saw you out there crying   And I thought I heard you call my name   And I thought I heard you out there crying   But are we all lost stars trying to light up the dark?.I hear music, mighty fine music   The murmur of a morning breeze up there   The rattle of the milkman on the stair      Sure that's music, mighty fine music   The singing of a sparrow in the sky   The perking of the coffee right nearby      That's my favorite melody   You, my angel, phoning me      I hear music, mighty fine music   And anytime I think my world is wrong   I get me out of bed and sing this song      That's my favorite melody   You, my angel, phoning me      I hear music, mighty fine music   And anytime I think my world is wrong   I get me out of bed and sing this crazy song.Good things, good things happen to me every night..He ain't the leavin' kind)   He ain't the leavin'...

"I belive that every one has thier right to thier own opinion.  If a parrent does not think that thier kid should do some thing dont let them. It kind of reminds me of how people are aginst hunting if you dont like it dont do it.     If every one would express thier own opinion the world would be alot better place.  If I dont like @PERSON1 and I tell @PERSON1 i dont like him @PERSON1 knows I dont like him so he wont talk to me any more.  So in a bigger picture if @LOCATION1 tells @LOCATION2 that we dont like thim they will not try to make friends with us any more.  so if everyone would speak thier mind the world would be alot better.     If a parent does not like some thing like a type of music, movie, or even book and they express that to thier kid they will learn that that thing is bad.  My dad tought me that it was fine to kill animals only if I am willing to eat them so that seams fine with me but other people might not think its right.  So I belive that if your not a hipocrite and live as you teach your kids to that your kids will listen to you.     As I have said before my dad tought me that its fine to kill animals if I am willing or going to eat them.  I find one exception to this rule cyotes (we have alot of cyotes where i live at and they can be a pest).  I belive that that is about the only exception to the rule because cyotes are problem animals in this area.     So if you dont want your kids watching rated @CAPS1 movies then block them on tv. Its the same thing with the other things like the magazines, books and music..That's where old John flogs his daily meat..No one's ever gonna nail him down   All because of the 45th floor..Ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah..Alleluia!.I see you walk with him   I see you talk to him   It tears me up, oh, it tears me up   And I can't stop crying   Oh, baby, I can't stop crying      I see you kiss his lips   And squeeze his fingertips   It tears me up, oh, baby, it tears me up   And there's nothing I can do about it      Oh, baby, baby, can't you see I'm still in love with you?.(that's where the party's at!).Everybody      Everybody is a part      Faster, faster, to welcome disaster..Troubles yeah, I can't explain what I can't see..Save me..Hey!...And I don't rap fast I rap slow..Dreaming was meant for night time   I live in dreams all the day,   I know it's not the right time,   But still I dream away   What could be sweeter than dreaming,   Just dreaming and drift away..After we all started to crawl,   The fire was real..Seconds ago   But why did you have to go?.yeah a real H time boy straight from HELENA man..Whoa, I need a man to love me   Oh, maybe you can help me, please..Have you seen her?,   (tell me have you seen her?).Walk away!.Ain't nothing maybe, baby   I sure would like to   I want to know   I want to know   I want to know   I sure would like to      Could it be he's interested?.I was in a real bad way   When you turned the power on   And you made me feel for all the world   Like I was the king of all the world      I was on a window ledge   When you came upon me there   Everything was upside for the moment   Right around the time I had to get going      Can't count me out   'Cause I've got your number   You make me feel like I'm   The king of all of the world   King of all of the world   The king of all of the world      Now I'm on my way up north   All its gonna do is rain   And I'm gonna want to go back to the world   Where I was the king of all of the world      Can't count me out   'Cause I've got your number   You make me feel like I'm   The king of all of the world   King of all of the world   The king of all of the world      I was in a real bad way   When you turned the power on   And you made me feel so right at home   I wonder if I'm ever gonna get back home      Can't count me out   'Cause I've got your number   You make me feel like I'm   The king of all of the world   King of all of the world   The king of all of the world      If I wander out   Of a picture window.Reminds me of - the one I love   Deep in the heart of texas."
"Every single person has there own beliefs and disbeliefs when it comes to books, music or anything in life for that matter. What @MONTH1 be a bad and vulgar book in our opinion @MONTH1 not be bad in others opinionated views. Everyone will have there own views about a book, music, movies, or magazines. That's why censorship is good in a public place like a library. Does that mean we're saying that you can't like what you want to like, listen to what you want to lisetn to, or watch what you want to watch in your own home? No, by censoring all that in public places like librarys or say video stores your helping fight a lot of trouble and concerns that could happen in the future.          Then again censoring movies, music, books, and magazines in a library could also be a bad thing. Not everyone is going to like the same things or be interested in all the same movies or books. At the same time though we can't censor every single thing someone doesn't like. By removing something because one parent has a complaint over their child watching, or reading a book they thought was too 'vulgar' then your giving that right to any parent that complains about their child doing that. It's not the librarys responsibility to watch over everyones child, to make sure they watch and read what their parents want them to. Kids will be kids and they'll do what they want to do.          By censoring and taking things off shelfs of librarys your not preventing them from watching a movie they shouldn't be seeing, or reading about book they're not supposed to be reading. Censoring librarys is just like censoring words in movies, by doing that it's not stopping your child from hearing or learing vulgar language. Children now in this day and age hear more vulgar words in school then they do in movies and television.       What does the word offensive really mean to a person? Everyone has their own opinion on whats offensive and whats not. Like i said, everyone has there own opinions and views on life and everything in it. You can't remove everything off the shelfs because one parent doesn't think it's right for their child or other children to be seeing, looking at, or listening to. We all have freedom to look at what we want and listen to the kind of music we feel like listening to. By taking things off the shelfs that maybe other people like oppose to others then your taking that right away as a @CAPS1 citizen. Censoring on some things like, sex scenes in movies, or maybe vulgar language in music is alright in my opinion. Taking books off the shelf because you don't like the way its written or you don't like the person who wrote it, or you don't like the kind of language the author decided to use in it isn't alright to me, you're pushing the limit on that one. Books teach kids things everyday, books give children imagination. By taking books off shelfs i think you're hurting a childs ability to grow.      Censoring is a good and bad thing. It could hurt children or it could help their ability to grow. Censoring some things are a good thing, but like i said not everything with vulgar language should be censored, or vulgar scences. Sometimes in order to grow and live in this world children need to read and see the things we as people but in books and movies.He's crafty and deceitful and he'll try to L.B.W.,   And bowl a maiden over..Whoa, whoa, where do all the porn stars go when the lights go down?.Heads down, buried in the sand   She's back now, I better wash my hands   She talks like a man gettin' higher than I can   Lovin' me when I'm in a rock band   Let her go      She's living in shadows   Waits there in the shadows tonight   And sleeps on a bed of nails   Let her go      Close the window, it's time to shut the door   Say a prayer now, and get down on the floor   There's a howling wind blowing through my brain   Moving in slow, just like the hurricane   Let her go      She's living in shadows   Waits there in the shadows tonight   And sleeps on a bed of nails   Let her go   Oh let her go   Yeah, let her go   Let her go      She can't fall in love   Her heart's cold as ice now   Let her go      She can't cry for love   There's no tears left inside for one to show   Let her go      She waits in the shadows tonight   And sleeps on a bed of nails   Let her go      She's living in shadows   Waits there in the shadows tonight   And sleeps on a bed of nails   Let her go   Yeah let her go   Yeah let her go   Let her go.We always look behind..With faith so true, robbed of his lands   He always knew she'd understand..Remember, there's no greater love,   Then to lay down your life for a friend..Just call my name, I'll be there..Ramona lived just down the hill from us..I get a rush,   down to my feet,   I get a rush..I went so numb on Christmas day   I couldn't feel my hands or feet   I shouldn't have come   She made me pay   For gleaming with Donald down her street   She put blame on him   And shame on me   She made it all seem so tawdry and cheap   ""Oh, let's be nice, Mama, open up your gifts   You know, happiness is the best face lift""      I mean, after all, she introduced us   Oh, but she regrets that now   Shacked up downtown   Making love without a license   Same old sacred cow   She said, ""Did you come home to disgrace us?"".But now that you and I are sharing a sigh   We know, yes, we know.Baby the angels are here,   Brought me a Bible and a gun,   Baby I wanted to stay with you,   But they're saying I?d better run,   Cause heaven?s a footstep away..He'll eat you   Alive!"".The last time you came through,   Oh darling, oh darling, oh darling      Tempest in a teacup,   Get unique..?.I'm not exactly sure I heard you right   What is it you want from me?.I don't want to leave you,   I don't want to leave you, I need you!.One step closer to knowing   One step closer to knowing   One step closer to knowing   To knowing, to knowing, to knowing.In my heart I still hope you will open the door   You can purify it all, answer my call.Your head's up your ass!.Drown them shadows once more   Once more   Once more, ooh      [Chorus]   Go home to nothing or stay out for more?.It's natural, it's an easy thing to do,   Natural, it's an easy thing to do."
"I do not think that there is a need to remove offensive materials from libraries. Some people @MONTH1 find these things offensive, but I think that others will be greatly offended if they remove these things.      Take rap music for example. There are many people that think that the lyrics of those  songs are just terrible and offensive. Other people think that rap music is amazing. I do not think rap is very good at all, but I would not go the extent of saying that rap songs should not be played on the radio, and that the @CAPS1 should not be sold in stores. The same thing could be said for these materials in the library. Some @MONTH1 find them offensive but others greatly apreciate it.     Some people @MONTH1 be interested in these topics. Just like some people @MONTH1 be interested in fantasy or comedy. It would not be  fair for libraries to remove these materails from the library, and deny the people that do like them the rite to rent these materials.     Another factors is the maturity of the reader. If the person who is reading book or viewing movies that @MONTH1 be offensive is viewing them for clear interest then is no problem with it. But if the reader is not reading for interest, then there is a problem there. It all depends on the maturity that people have when they enter a library. The materials in libraries are there to give everyone a chance to find something that interests them. Just because someone else @MONTH1 find those materials offensive is no reasons to take them off the shelf.     I can see why some parents @MONTH1 be upset that their kids @MONTH1 see some of the things in the library that @MONTH1 not be apropriate, but all the libraries that I have been to have a had a special area for kids materials. If the parents where woried about their kids seing some the questionable materials they could bring the kid to that area.     I dont think that these materials that @MONTH1 seem offensive to some people should be removed from libraries. Everyone is going to be affended by something and it is not fare to deprive others of those materials even it is offensive to some..How do you?.I think he's been there and he could show me..I'm dreaming of a white Christmas   Just like the ones I used to know   Where the tree tops glisten   And children listen   To hear sleigh bells in the snow      I'm dreaming of a white Christmas   With every Christmas card I write   May your days be merry and bright   And may all your Christmases be white      Where the tree tops glisten   And children listen   To hear sleigh bells in the snow      I'm dreaming of a white Christmas   With every Christmas card I write   May your days be merry and bright   And may all your Christmases be white.Well I'm out on the road, and the devil's got my soul   And I'm looking for the Lord in New York City      Yeah I'm out on the run, got some heat, got a gun   If they don't find me soon, it'll be a damn pity      So it's      [Chorus:]      Goodbye girl,

last time   Let me see you smile again      I'll take my records   You can have your books   I'm sorry I never read them   But it says so much about us      Always trying   To make love out of care   The perfect recipe   But something wasn't there      [Chorus]   And I wish you   Sunrays and Saturdays   Perfect starry nights   Sweet dreams and moonbeams   And a love that's warm and bright      Sunrays and Saturdays   Friendship strong and true   Oceans of blue and a room with a view   To live the life you choose      You'll write me letters   I'll call you on the on the phone   A wire away from touching   And never quite alone      We'll get to know ourselves again   And we'll heal our hearts   It's not that we're bad together   We're just better off apart      Always trying   To have one and one make two   And even though it never worked   I still feel love for you      [Chorus]      Sunrays and Saturdays   Friendship strong and true   Oceans of blue and a room with a view   To live the life you, live the life you,   Live the life you choose.I've been called by many names   And all of them are bad..An angels kiss is the kiss you gave to me   An angels touch, has touched my

"Censorship in libraries should not be allowed. Libraries are given to people for new learning opportuites and for entertainment purposes. Everyone has their own likes and dislikes, not two peoples are the same.     First of all when a person goes to the library they should know that the books that are in there were selected by the owner of the library. Therefore it is their responsibility to put books into the library and take books out. What the owner of a library will try to do is to put a little bit of everything in it. What is ment by this statement is that there are so many differnt types of writting that people are bound to not like something. So that is why the owner will add a bit of everything into their library.      If someone has gotten a book that seems to be to their type of book, but after they start to read it they find it offensive to them they should not just throw the book out all together, but they should take it back to the library and talk to the owner about it. People have their rights to do what they want with a book, but if it is a book from the library then it technically is proporty of the library. So if someone gets offended with a book they should go talk to the owner let them know their concern, and try to have something done about it. In truth they will not be the only ones who have that oppionin. It takes one person to make the difference.      Books are not made for just one person they are made for many people to read and possibly enjoy. People have their oppininons and will stick by them. Thats expected to happen with books, they are all different as are people. The society that everyone lives in is filled with people of diverse oppions and who are not afraid of expressing them. There is nothing wrong with expressisng them eigther, actually its better that way only because then others can hear about a book and eigther agree with that oppionoin or disagree, therefore finding out what type of writing do they really like.      Books yes can be thrown out by rights, but the moment everyone starts doing that is the moment when everyone can no longer spread their oppionion. To spread an oppion is to let the world know wehre someone stands on a spacific topic. Without that the world would be just plain old boring having nothing to talk about because people would all share the same opinoin. Censorship in libraries should not be allowed for more reasons than one.                                       ~~@PERSON1.She's got everything she needs, she's an artist, she don't look back..I'd

me where they've gone      From Jordan to Chicago   Another child is born   Trusting that we'll get it   Right this time   I should've worn my glasses   You said just to trust   Then you chose   To sign the dotted line      From modern Magdalenes   To my DJ friends   They all have said   ""He's got to watch his back""      They're trapping angels   By the Potomac   But it's not how you think   You'd be surprised   They liberate   Your dreamscape   Till you can't remember   To recall   Where your wings   Have gone      Before I close my eyes at night   I can still see you smilin'   Before the truth was   Buried alive   Did we prize it   Before you change the world   Maybe boy you should change   Your girl      They're trapping angels   By the Potomac   They're trapping angels   Lord I

last bolt of sunshine hits the mountain,   And the stars start to splatter in the sky,   When the moon hits the southwest horizon,   With the scream of an eagle on the fly,   I will walk alone by the black muddy river,   And listen to the ripples as they moan,   I will walk alone by the black muddy river,   And sing me a song of my own..Hitchhike to Rhome..Eclipse on the moon when the dark bird flies   Where is the child with his father's eyes?.Egomaniac   Dazzling like a diamond   Dazzling like a diamond.Oh yeah, yeah   I said baby you're not lost..Not a day before he fell   Propping up the

heavens above..Ion is gone,   His time is done..'Cause she looked   'Cause she looked like broken glass   When she fell to the ground   I heard the sound of thunder   Trailing off   When she started coming 'round   But she couldn't make him stop   And she wouldn't let it go   So everytime she got back up   Like broken glass went tumblin' down   Tumblin' down      First time that I saw your face   You looked so lost and kind   Should have recognized that   Troubled look   From the road I left behind   But I thought that I could comfort you   Or was it you could comfort me,   Never saw your anger 'till you blew   Never saw your anger 'till you blew      And I feel   Oh I'd feel like broken glass   When I fell to the ground   I heard the sound of thunder   Trailing off   When I started coming 'round   But I couldn't make you stop   And you wouldn't let it go   So everytime I got back up   Like broken glass went tumbling down....Even if it leads nowhere      I'd build myself up,   And fly around in circles,   Waiting as my heart drops,   And my back begins to tingle   Finally could this be it or      Should I give up,   Or should I just keep chasing pavements?"
"I think that everyone has the right to hate or abhor cetian works but only the author of the work has the right to take it off of the shelf. The reason that just anyone can not take a work off the shelf is if the one person hates the work but everyone else likes it then imanenge how the people who like the work must feel when they hear it was distroyed.     Can you think of how the author of any work would feel if thousands of their works were being distroyed without any thought to others? I can and I feel horible just thinking about it so I belive that is the reason that only the creator of anything should make the disicion if their work should be saved or distroyed.     With these reasons that I have shaired with you please consider how everyone feels before you destroy anything if it is a book, movie, song, or even a childs dreams think about how thet would feel if anything of theirs was distroyed..Lord, the feelings are not the same,   I guess I'm older, I guess I've changed..I've always counted all my blessings   Knowing you'll defend me, stand by my side   I

"What @CAPS1 You Do?     A very big battle for a lot of people is if libraries should allow offensive matterial to be on their shelves. Some people don't care, but some people think it's a very big issue. For the people who care, their view on the issue is that the offensive matterial should be taken off of the library shelf. I personally believe that it should be ok for 'offensive' matterial to be on the shelves of the libraties across the @ORGANIZATION1.     What is conciterd offensive? Each and every person has their own view on what they think is offensive. An example is a young child @MONTH1 think that the word 'stupid' is a curse word while some older people think that it is not a curse word. If we did take off all the offensive matterial from the libraries, there @CAPS1 be nothing left. You @MONTH1 think that the @ORGANIZATION2 is a very good book, but if you talk to someone who believes the @ORGANIZATION2 is false, they @MONTH1 think that by having the @ORGANIZATION2 of the shelf is offensive to their own beliefs. Because so many people have a difforent view on what is offensive, no one @CAPS1 ever be able to actually have a non-offensive library. A group of people @CAPS1 not be able to agree on what is or what isn't offensive.      There are a lot of websites and organizations that say what they personally think is offensive and what is not. People can go to those websites and organizations to know what they personally should check out from the library. It should not be the libraries own job to say what you can and can not check out. Each person is responsible for their own actions. If a person wants to check out a book or movie that some people think is offensive, so be it. It is a free world. Some people @MONTH1 not aprove of their choice, but again, they have the right to read that book or listen to that music.     In conclusion I state: no one should be able to say what you can and can not have on the shelves of the library. If someone personally thinks that a movie or book is offensive, then they should not watch that movie or read that book. Really the question should not be, 'Should we remove books, music, movies, magazines, etc. from the library that are offensive?', the question should be, 'Should I be reading this book, watching this movie, or listening to this music?'. It is everyone's own choice to read a book or listen to a @LOCATION1. We are not accountable for what other people do. It is not the libraries own resonsiblility to be a mother to all of it's cusomers. Let the libraries be!.Like a bridge over troubled water,   I will ease your mind!.Baby, you're no good..Because of rain I fell in love with you   The raindrops seem to want to help me, too   Because

"I THINK THAT IF A BOOK IS FOUND OFFINSIVE THEN YOU SHOULDN'T READ IT. CAUSE WHAT IF SOMEONE ELSE LIKES THE BOOK, THEY HAVE THE RIGHT TO READ THAT BOOK . MAYBE IT'S AN INSPIRATION TO THEM,MAYBE IT WILL DRIVE THEM TO ACCOMPLISH SOMETHING THEY WANT IN THIER LIFE.  WHEN SOMEONE WALKS INTO A LIBRARY NO ONE CAN TELL THEM WHAT TO GET THEY MAKE THAT DECISION THEMSELVES, SO WHEN A BOOK OFFENDS YOU MAYBE YOU SHOULD WRIGHT TO THE AUTHER AND TALK TO HIM\HER. ABOUT THEIR BOOK.  THINGS YOU COULD ACCOMPLISH BY WRIGHTING THE AUTHOR IS A LETTER IN THE MAIL STATEING THAT HE OR SHE IS SORRY FOR HURTING YOU WITH THEIR BOOK ,ANOTHER IS MAYBE A VISIT FROM THE AUTHOR IN PERSONSON TO TELL YOU THAT HE OR SHE IS SORRY FOR THE PAIN THAT HE OR SHE BOOK BROUGHT YOU. THAT'S WHAT I THINK. ALSO NO I DON'T THINK THAT THE BOOK/ BOOKS SHOULD BE TAKEN OFF THE SHELVESCAUSE MAYBE JUST MAYBE IT WILL MOTIVATE SOMEONE ELSE INSTEAD OF PUTTING THEM DOWN.

"'Do you believe that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc. should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive?' @CAPS1 these items should be taken off the shelves if found offensive.  First off, they should be removed because some people @MONTH1 be offended by them. Some @MONTH1 talk about race, religion or gender. Nobody wants to be criticized in a book or such. For example: rap music, all that is, is just people taking about what color they are or how big or small they are. Some people @MONTH1 be offended, and im sure no parent wants their child to be listening to that nonsense. So take them off the radio. Second off, if a child gets ahold of a criticizing book or movie or such that item can have a bad affect in the later future. They could start criticizing people for being different. Some books talk about religion, some people just cannot help their religion, they were born that way so they are familiar with it and do not want to change. No one should be judged for their religion, so take them off the shelves. Thirdly, my friend was watching a movie and it was about a female that liked the same sex, and in that movie they were making fun of her. No one should be judged by which sex they like. She was very offended. So take them off the shelves. Second to last, magazine authors take pictures of celebrities and down size them about three sizes smaller than what they really are and put them on the cover of fashion magazines or such. Why not just put that celebrity on there as the size they really are? Some @MONTH1 take offense to that. So just take pictures of celebrity and put them on the magazine as their real size or take them off the shelves. In conclusion,  in some of my observations and reading some people get offended quite often for being a different race, gender, or  religion. So I believe that certain materials such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc should be taken off the shelves if they are found offensive.As long as I kept him out of site,   I kept from going out of my mind..Big Sky's too high to see   People like you and me..Heaven please send to all mankind,   Understanding and peace of mind..'Round and 'round   And we won't let go   And where we stop   No one knows   Uh-huh uh-huh      Down and down   In a spin we turn   Looking like   We'll never learn   Uh-huh uh-huh      Think about   What ev'ryone is saying   Ruby dear   Oh don't you hear      Late at night   When the radio is playing   Ruby dear   So looky here      Oh this record's broken   It slips a beat   And all those watermelons   Have gone to seed      Nothing lives   In this dirty little river   No one here   Will shed a tear      It dried up   But it couldn't run forever   Ruby dear   That's what we hear      I still like the ocean   Down by the sea   They left that door wide open   It tempted me   Hounding me   From the bedroom to the kitchen      Ruby dear   I'm still right here   Now they threw   The fox amongst the chickens   It's too deep   I'll drown in my sleep!.You look at me, and what do you say?.Like you a   Chip munk and...

"I do not believe that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from shelves at a library if they could be found offensive. It is good to be unique, and no matter how innapropriate a subject might be, it is still factual and helpful in learning. If anything they should just put a label on the cover of the book that says somthing along the lines of 'adult content.' @CAPS1 repeats it's self, and this quote reminds me of periods in @CAPS1 where we need to learn from our mistakes, no matter how bad the subjects are, such as the @CAPS2, and the @CAPS3 @CAPS4 @CAPS5 in the deep south.      What about the @CAPS2, when @NUM1 million @CAPS7 were killed because they were @CAPS7. @CAPS7 @MONTH1 find these books offensive but that doesn't mean the @CAPS2 never happened. There are many offensive and contraversial pictures and stories about events that happened during the @CAPS2. Even though this is a very depressing and horrific subject, it is still good for our @CAPS20 to learn about what happened. And other catagories need to be read because it can help @CAPS20 to understand right from wrong, and help prevent them from making big mistakes in the future.     The @CAPS3 @CAPS4 started from the @DATE1's all the way until @CAPS13 @CAPS14 @NUM2. The @CAPS3 @CAPS4 took a toll on everyone in the @LOCATION1A, but some people couldn't handle it as well as others. In the south, most @CAPS19 treated @CAPS17 @CAPS18 as dirt. They didn't let them in their schools, in their clubs or churches, they were rude towards them, and most horrific of all, they lynched them. There were a set of @PERSON1 called the '@PERSON1,' which pretty much was a list of @PERSON1 to treat @CAPS25 as unfairly as possible. If a kid were to pick up a book or magazine with pictures of lynchings in them, they would remember it their whole life, and if that one picture truly bothered them, they their whole life growing up, they would realize that what @CAPS19 did to @CAPS25 was unethical.          Some books and magazines in libraries are really explicit, but we can't shelter our @CAPS20 their whole lives. Parents need to sit down with their @CAPS20 when they have questions and discuss the truth with them. What are parents going to do when their @CAPS20 go to school and hear other @CAPS20 talk about subjects such as sex? @CAPS20 could get the wrong idea about sex or not know exactly what it is because their parents never actually sat down and explained to them what sex is. I am not saying to go let your @NUM3 year old look at pictures of people having sex by any means, but when @CAPS20 get to a certain age, their parents need to step up and talk to them about uncomfortable subjects such as puberty, sex, and babies.     It is time parents stop hiding the truth from their @CAPS20, or hovering over their shoulders like helecoptors. If @CAPS20 don't learn the truth about the real @CAPS13 and about how many evil and manipulative people there are in the @CAPS13, when they go to college they won't be able to stand for themselves. If @CAPS20 don't learn about @CAPS1 and what all has been done, it is kind of like we are treating the books like the @CAPS7 and the @CAPS17 @CAPS18 were treated. Just because these books are different than others we will just get rid of them, just like how we tried to kill off all the @CAPS7 and @CAPS25 because they were different. And it is wrong and inhuman.Grandma take me home!.

"Do citizens have the right to remove books, magazines, and other materials from shelves because they personally do not agree with the content? Censorship in libraries is a subject with an unclear answer.  Some believe it is in their right to get rid of books, music, and movies with what they believe is 'offensive' material. Others think library censorship is wrong, that people should have access to whatever material they please. Censorship is simply a way of preventing knowledge from those who wish to learn more about worlds outside their own.     In @DATE1's society, there are no limits. The human imagination can create beautiful works of literary art and music, but it can also create material not suitable for every age group. Library censorship is a way to keep this 'unsuitable' material away from young and curious eyes. However, what @MONTH1 be unacceptable for children to view @MONTH1 be perfectly fine for a mature adult. Censorship is purely opinion. If a person is a strict believer that @CAPS1 created the world in seven days, they might find it offensive to see a book or a movie that supports the theory of evolution. If a parent does not want their child to watch @CAPS2, they would rather their children not see a @CAPS2 disk in the children's section for their child to see. If one person harbors a profound grudge against @CAPS4, it is unfair to others if all @CAPS5 content is removed from a library's shelves. If a person does not wish to have access to certain 'offensive' subjects, then they do not have to expose themselves to it. But it is not in their rights to remove it from the view of others who @MONTH1 wish to educate themselves on the said matters.     Writing is a form of self- expression, a method by which to convey feelings and thoughts and share them with others. It is also a way to teach and to inform others about the past. But if what is written is not shared, how can one form their own opinions and thoughts when they are not exposed to the opinions of those outside their community? It is unfair to prevent someone from learning about a certain subject simply because one or two other people oppose the content. If books and movies containing information unacceptable to one person were removed, then everyone else has the right to have material of their choice removed as well. Eventually, there would be nothing left because everyone is offended by one thing or another. That is one of the beauties of being an @CAPS6 citizen: freedom of speech. By living in @LOCATION1, one has the right to read or learn about whatever they please. Censorship prevents learning from those who want it.     Parents are possibly some of the biggest advocates of library censorship. Not wanting their children to be exposed to explicit or graphic material is understandable. But just because they do not want their child to see a movie about devil worship or the @CAPS7 era does not mean the parent has the right to prevent all others from seeing it. Children need to be exposed to these kinds of things at some point to encourage open- mindedness and acceptance of others. Libraries provide a source by which young people can educate themselves on the religions, beliefs, and customs of the outside world. It should not be up to the parents to decide what is put on the library shelves; if they do not want their children to have access to certain subjects, do not allow them to go to the library.      In conclusion, one can say library censorship is a matter of opinion. Citizens have a right to read, listen to, or watch whatever material they please. Granted, it is acceptable for parents to shield their children from certain subjects, but it is unaccepable for those same parents to prevent others in the community from learning. Freedom to express one's opinions in the form of literature means nothing if that literature cannot be shared with others. As Katherine Paterson once said, '...

"Certain books, magazines, music and movies should not be put on the shelves of a library. Children can learn rude or nasty things that their parents might not find alright for their child. There are some things that can be offensive in a library like prejudice books or music. Often music uses swearing language or states certain views on politics.     Libraries need to take control of this issue the right way. Getting rid of the material is not what should be done. Libraries need to keep better watch over certain sections of the library. They could do this by not letting children leave their parents side. That way parents can know and control what their children are seeing.     Then there is the issue of offending people. These problems could be resolved simply by putting up signs in different spots of the library. These sign could be in big bold letters stating 'Certain things in this section can be offending', '@CAPS1 control needed past this point'. Libraries should be more aware of how people feel about the way they are set up and presented to the public. Libraries should put them selves in the publics shoes, to see how they would like it if some of these things were showed to their children. Also, looking at things in a point of view of how some things could be offending, to fix the problems.     Once when I was in a library I was offended by a book title that was against my religion. After seeing that I thought if their were a sign or something around to warn me I would not of had to see that. Other things like this have occured in a library like one time my brother rented a movie my parents did not approve of. But with the way the libraries are set up and controled my brother was able to rent the movie and sneak it past my parents. Other children like my brother could do the same things only worse like look at an inappropiate magazine or read certain books that parents would not approve.     These types of occurances need to stop before something really bad happens. Libraries need to take control and show they know how to present things to the public in a proper manner. Actions that are happening in todays libraries are not alright. Putting up signs and requiring @CAPS1 control can reduce if not elliminate these unapproved occurances.It's best you rest inside a while as blue doesn't seem to suit you right..Learn to believe   In

"I do not think that materials, such as books, music, movies, and magazines should be removes from shelves if they are found offensive. I think this because people have different views and belifts on certains types of things, with reglion, culture, and sexaually. Some people can be defend by it but other might can be inform and learn new facts that they didn't already know.      People are not going to look at things the same. Eveyone has their own way of life and think differently. If one person feel the book was offensive to them then they would take it off the shelves. One by one people would find other materials offenive and what does it leave us. No more books, music, movies, and magazines.     Let face it everyone have different belifts, values, and purpose but taking a materials off the shelves because they found it offensive is ridulous to me. I say if they find it offensive don't read the book again or the magazine again. Feel offensive over a movie don't watch it again and the same as music don't listen to it again. Easy as that. Materials give us resources and we learn new things. If we didn't have materials like books, music, movies, and magazines we wouldn't be as smart as we is @CAPS1 are. American is about being free and have rhe right to speak our mind. So putting materials off of shelves is not the answer.Now, if she ever comes now, now   If she ever comes now, now   If she ever comes now...
