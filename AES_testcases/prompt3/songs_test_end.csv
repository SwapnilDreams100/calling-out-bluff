"The features of the environmental setting is affecting the cyclist. A setting is a certain time and place an event is taking place along with the setting their are features, which is the background description basically giving away additional information about the subject or idea. The features along with the setting are intefering with the cyclist by the hot temperature in Lodi, California making the cyclist or biker hotter than usualier as he heads in the wrong direction closer and nearer to the hot blazen scroaching desert. In addition to this he is running out of water and is beginning to get more and more exhausted from the heat plus he is starting to lose consciousness along with getting dehydrated. This is a major problem for the character because he is losing his sense of direction and because of this he is getting more panickly as his supply of water is running extremely low. A instance of the environmental setting affecting the cyclist is “I eased past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state. The water bottle contained only a few tantalizing sips. Wide rings of dried sweet circled my skirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from heartstroke on a gorgeous in June ""(Joe Kurmaskie, @NUM1)."" @CAPS1 example is “This sight was troubling. I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly and I was travelling through the high deserts of California in June “(Joe Kurmaskie, @NUM2)”. The hotness and heat had also increased the character’s confidence in himself as he was getting more and more panickly. A instance of this is “I began breaking the ride down into distances. I could see on the horizon, telling myself that if I could make it this far, I’d be fine “(Joe Kurmaskie, @NUM1). In conclusion, the hot setting in California had affected the cyclist in a number of ways it had exhasted his water supply and this caused him to become exhausted, dehydrated, and making him lose his logically sense to make decisions however his loss of sense of direction also gave him more self confidence as he stirved to the roads and serves town that was about twenty miles away in order to get water so that he @MONTH1 survive..The guy at the desk said it was OK   For you to come inside cuz he knew you'd stay   Greg G. and Garfield yelled ""Hooray""      [Chorus: x2].Re-package!.No answers for the asking..Jimmy Buffet doesn't live here any more      Verse 4   So don't tell me I sound like Jimmy Buffet   Just because I got that island beat   Jimmy might have grown up on the ocean   Me, I kinda grown up on the street   Music's just a way of life, me I'm liv'in free   Don't lay all that Key West Jimmy Buffet shit on me   Verse 5   Now Divers Do It Deeper must have really made them mad   Some of them reviewers said it really sounded bad   Well they liked Margaritaville, me I liked it too   Someday Jimmy, why don't we just both get drunk and screw   Oh those creepy Mother Fuckers that think music is a whore   Tell that you just don't live in Key West anymore   Chorus:   There's sailboats and conk shells and palm trees galore,   But Jimmy buffet doesn't live in Key West anymore   Sister spare change has a bumper sticker on the door   Says Jimmy Buffet doesn't live here any more.Is it just the name upon the bottle   The determines if it will?.Did I let you down?.I can feel changes comin' on."
"The features of the setting affected the cyclist in several ways. The first was the terrain, which started out flat, then turned to hills. The cyclist was growing tired from all the pedaling. “Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.” This tired him out faster, since going uphill is harder than riding flat terrain. The heat definitely affected him, because it made him thirsty. He was “travelling through the high deserts of California in June.” This is a very hot time of year, and when a person get lost without conserving water, which he had not done, a person get extremely thirsty. Not to mention the “sandblasted picture of a young boy pourng a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth,” which would remind the body of its thirst. So the setting most definitely affected the cyclist.It's just a matter of time before, before   It's just a matter of time before, before   And though I hate to rewind before, before   It's just a matter of time      What does it matter now?.Oh, no, let me get inside   Oh, no, oh, we, love no one but me   And I'll never, never, never   I'll never set you free   Good gosh, come down, see   I need a love I can rely on   I'll give you my shoulder to cry on   Say you'll never, never, never   Love no one but me   Whoa, a little bitta soul   Yeah, yeah, dance hall.Come back..It had to be you      'Cause nobody else gave me a thrill..I wake up every morning with a smile on my face   Everything in it's place as it should be   I start out every morning just as free as the breeze   My cares upon the shelf   Because I find myself with      No strings and no connections   No ties to my affections   I'm fancy free and free for anything fancy      No dates that can't be broken   No words that can't be spoken   Especially when I am feeling romancy      Like a robin upon a tree   Like a sailor that goes to sea   Like an unwritten melody   I'm free, that's me      So      Bring on the big attraction   My decks are cleared for action   I'm fancy free and free for anything fancy.We flew here to see you   My feelings and I   I looked down on the city   From up in the sky   The sun was reflecting   From the roofs and the water   Spring had come early   In the parks and the old town   I came with a mission   To patch up a dream   We walked and I talked and my words were absorbed   Into the answering machine      I came two thousand miles   Just to take a look at you   But you were broken and frozen   A heartbreak of a statue   In the bullet-proof mirrors   Where your eyes used to be   I stared at myself and I called for some help   Into the answering machine      The day slipped by and I tried and tried   You took me home and you said   ""Goodnight, Sleep tight""   On the floor by the bedroom door   I watched you sleep and I left before first light      The bugs don't bite   The bugs don't bite   The bugs bite      From the land of the frozen   To the land of the low   We journeyed together   But we were always alone   So if I should come calling   Best not pick up the phone   Cause I'm no good for you and you're no good for me   Let me talk to the answering machine   I can cope with the answering machine   I'm a friend of the answering machine.You see its all very easy for you but we have a lot of work to do so were going to play you this song instead."
"The setting of the essay, “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” effects the cyclists physical and emotional attitude. In the beginning of the essay the cyclist, “rode into the morning with strong legs and a smile on [his] face.” It was not too hot yet in the morning. So, the cyclist was happy and strong. He was confident he could conquer anything. As the day grew on “the sun was beginning to beat down” He was beginning to drink lots of water but he was still confident and strong. “I came to a ramshackle shed [and] several rusty pumps the sight was troubling. “The cyclist was travelling in the hot deserts of California. He was becoming tired and thirsty. He had to save as much water as possible. What started as a confident ride into the desert became a survival ride. Once the cyclist findswater he is relieved. He feels more confident and can ride to his destination. The weather and setting can affect us emotionally and physically just like in the essay, the cyclist became tired both physically and emotionally as the hot, sunny day went on..Yeah, be very afraid   These other rappers getting bodied and carried away   Fuck it me and Nicki Nick gettin' married today   And now you bitches that be hatin' can catch a bouquet, ooh   Yeah, you a star in my eyes, you and all them white girls party of five   Are we drinking a lil' more I can hardly decide   I can't believe we really made it I'm partly surprised, I swear   Damn, this one for the books, man!.This is a message,   A message to y'all:   Together we stand,   Divided we fall, oh!.It's my girl   (My girl, my girl)   Talkin' 'bout my girl   (My girl)      Whoo   Hey, hey, hey   Hey, hey, hey      I don't need no money, fortune or fame   I've got all the riches, baby   You know that one man alone can claim   Oh but I guess you'll say   What can make me feel this way?.I'm haunted by the mystery of red, red, red!.I will make you believe   You are lovely..What?.I may not have a whole lot of money   But I got enough girl for you and me   I'm takin' off won't you come with me honey   Gonna take you all the way to Paris, Tennessee      I want to show you the Riviera   Got good tires and a good CB   Put on some lipstick your mascara   'Cause we're goin' all the way to Paris, Tennessee      Baby I adore you   And don't say I've never done nothin' for you   Girl, that just ain't true      Here we go....

"The setting in “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” @CAPS1 the cyclist's physical and mental state. There are negative and positive effects for each state. The physical effects of the cyclist because of the settings all apparent throughout the story. For example, the cyclist reaches @PERSON2 and @PERSON1’s Fish Camp, he is able to hydrate once again. The positive effect makes the cyclist healthy and safe once again. The setting mentally, @CAPS1 the cyclist very substantitially. This can be seen when the cyclist in the comfortable camp around in @LOCATION1. He feels happy in this area. This positive effect prepares the cyclist to go on the trip to Yosemite. Also, when the cyclist reaches the “Ramshackle @CAPS2, several rusty pumps, and a corral, “he feels troubled. He is negatively affected mentally by the little amount of available water. In addition, the cyclist felt ""sad"" and ""hopeless” when cycling in the Dry, arid terrain. The cyclist is in the worst mental state in this place. Finally, the cyclist felt relieved upon seeing the fish camp. He describes the feeling by saying that his trouble are now “behind” him. Settings positive effect in this instance changes mental state from negative to positive. Setting was the main factor in deciding upon the cyclist’s physical and mental state. Setting @CAPS1 the cyclist’s physical and mental state in positive and mental states almost equally in the story..[Chorus]      Ohhhhhhhhhh   Anytime you start it,   Grow up a little, darlin x2      [Chorus]      Ohhhhhhhhhh   Anytime you start it,   Grow up a little, darlin.And lately I've little cause to smile,   Ever since she goose-stepped down the aisle..My mother told me   'Fore she passed away   Said son when I'm gone   Don't forget to pray      'Cause there'll be hard times   Lord those hard times   Who knows better than I?.yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah   (Yeah) We'll be alright (ahh!).Ooh, what a powerful force   Howling around in my brain..You think you got everyone figured out   We are leavin' in a glass house   Cause everything is shadowing all around   Now tell me what you mad about   I'm tired of developing nonsense   And if you were to leave me now   I probably do nothing to stop it      Missing you anymore!.Run now, here the winter comes."
"In the essay Do not exceed posted speed limit by Joe Kurmaskie, the surrounding setting affected the cyclist. The setting was somewhere outside Lodi, California in early summer. The cyclist took advice from some old men that led him to difficult places to get out of. As the sun made things better and his water started to deplete getting to Yosemite was much harder. The cyclist was traveling through high deserts of California in June. When the terrain started to change from flat road to rolling hills the cyclist pushed himself even harder to get to his destination. The sun and hot air dehydrated him faster. After traveling over, ""along, crippling hill,”  the cyclist had to stop and even tried sucking on apebble in an effort to take his mind off thirst. When he found a habited store he was exhausted and relieved. Then features of the setting had a big effect on the cyclist. The weather dehydrated him while the terrain exhausted him.   .I bombed Korea every night..Think You're God, Don't You Wish You Had Control,   Think You're Loved But There's No One There At All....[Guitar Solo]      Tell me about your fantasies   You know what I need tonight   Baby, you and me, we're like TNT   Light the dynamite      [Chorus]      Too much trouble (too much trouble)   Ready, steady, ... (ready, steady, ...)   Danger you   Danger me   Danger us      Wow!.You might say that we're young   You might say we're unlearned   But there's one thing I know   Though I'm younger than you   Even Jesus would never forgive what you do   Let me ask you one question   Is your money that good?.""Bow-wow-yippie-yo-yippie-yay""   ""Man's best friend""   ""I can dig it!"".So I play ""fair"" like roller coasters and clowns..When they went to bed that night, no one would have believed   That in the morning light would not be there   The dark hung heavy on the air like the grip of a jealous man   No place was there known to have been spared   Then panic took control of minds as fear hit everyone   The day the light went out of the daytime sky      Artificial light could hardly penetrate the gloom   Nothing out of reach could be observed   Looting, pillage, murder, rape became the rule of that day   Who hit him no one knew, or whom he hit   Cars were caught in pileups and the planes could never land   The day the light went out of the daytime sky      ""Now I can rest here after my journey   Now I can feed here before I continue."""
"The features of the settings affect the cyclist in many ways when he starts of, he is bright and happy just as the slenecy is nice and calming. There is a pace that makes him feel like nothing wrong. “I rode into the morning with strong legs and a smile on my face.” After about @NUM1 miles on the cold, his life was getting low, and he came to his second abundant place. He then felt a little disturbed and worried. He needed to find a place with water. “This site was trebling.”  There he fins water plant not his hopes rise a bit, until he finds the water isn’t good. “A tarlike substance oozed out, followed by brickish water feeling some which is in the neighborhood of two hundred trees”. So he moves on and finally he re aches life! He is so relieved he can’t believe his luck.” Then as easily as rounding a body my troubles, thirst and fear were all behind me “The setting affects the mood in a very big way, the cyclist feels as the setting looks..[Hook]   When I pull up on a nigga   Tell that nigga back back   I'm too good with these words   Watch a nigga backtrack   If I die, all I know is I'm a mother fuckin legend   It's too late for my city   I'm the youngest nigga reppin   Oh my God, oh my God   If I die, I'm a legend   Oh my God, oh my God   If I die, I'm a legend      [Verse 1]   I'm on first, I'm on tour   Got a girl, she from the South   Used to work, used to dance in Texas   Now she clean the house   Everyday, I was strugglin' to learn what life's about   On my way, money taught me Spanish   Make it andale   Way up north, packed in Honda cars   They 'ont know who we are   Fuck em all, they only pussy niggas shootin at the star   Right or wrong, I'ma write my wrongs   They can't live this long   You don't know where you're gonna go   I got this shit mapped out strong      [Pre-Hook]      [Hook]   When I pull up on a nigga   Tell that nigga back back   I'm too good with these words   Watch a nigga backtrack   If I die, all I know is I'm a mother fuckin legend   It's too late for my city   I'm the youngest nigga reppin   Oh my God, oh my God   If I die, I'm a legend   Oh my God, oh my God   If I die, I'm a legend      [Verse 2]   I'm the one, one   Why do I feel like the only one?.All this time the river flowed endlessly to the sea..'And I'm still looking for the rhythm.'.Caroling, caroling now we go   Christmas bells are ringing   Caroling, caroling through the snow   Christmas bells are ringing   Joyous voices sweet and clear   Sing the sad of heart to cheer   Ding, dong, ding, dong   Christmas bells are ringing   (Caroling, caroling through the town)   Christmas bells are ringing   (Caroling, caroling up and down)   Oh, Christmas bells are ringing   (Mark ye well the song we sing)   (Gladsome tidings now we bring)   Ding, dong, ding, dong   Christmas bells are ringing   (Caroling, caroling now we go)   It's Christmas   (Joyous voices sweet and clear)   (Sing the sad of heart to cheer)   Ding, dong, ding, dong   Ding, dong, ding, dong   Oh, caroling, caroling through the town   Christmas bells are ringing   Caroling, caroling up and down   Christmas are ringing   Mark thee well the song that we sing   Gladsome tidings now we bring   Ding, dong, ding, dong   Christmas bells are ringing   Oh, caroling (caroling, caroling)   We're caroling   (Caroling, caroling)   Through the town here we go   (Caroling, caroling)   And there's lots of our voices to cheer   (Caroling, caroling)   Sweet and clear   Bells are ringing so fine   It's a wonderful time of the year   Far and near   Oh caroling.....Outside in the distance a wildcat did growl,   Two riders were approaching, the wind began to howl..It's quite clear that I'm back in the swing of living   Although I might not be on the right track..Wind blows by low light   Side tracked low light   Can't see my tracks your scent way back      Can I be here all alone?"
"Several features of the setting that affected the cyclist were time of year, the desert land, the lack of civilization, the lack of resources – especially water, and the rugged characteristics of the land. The cyclist was traveling during the summer time, which was the hottest time of the year. He was also traveling through the deserts which create an even hotter climate. “I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June,” was a quote from the selection that tells us this. If he had been traveling in the @DATE2, for example, he @MONTH1 have been more comfortable. Throughout his trip, the author does not after come desert civilization. He runs into a deserted factory and miles of land without people. The fact that he is traveling through desert terrain also helps us realize that water is scarce. He has trouble finding a place to get water. This made the trip extra hard and discouraging. “I was going to die” he says. As he travels farther, the land also becomes harder to travel on. “Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills” this characteristic is a setting, like the others, negatively affects the cyclist by making his journey harder..?.Deep down in the dead of night I call out your name..I remember days or at least I try   But as years go by, they're a sort of haze   And the bluest ink isn't really sky..What does it mean?.Want you like I've never wanted anyone,   Got a face like God and a bod' like John..I know it isn't very easy,   When you find yourself out on your own..i find little entertains me anymore the problems of the world are often tedious and worn i'm reading all about it with a chuckle and a sneer they say a new beginning and they say the end is near get in your self- assuredness and take it for a spin you'll be standing by yourself when they've all given in it's ""take before it's taken from you"" every single day i wish it wasn't like this i don't know another way"
" The harsh setting in “DO Not Exceed Posted Speed limit “by Joe Kurmaskie made the @CAPS1 for the cyclist more difficult due to the hot weather and the inconsistancy of the pavement. The very hot June day was a cause of the cyclist slowing down. “wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt and the growing realization that I could drop from heat stroke on a gorgeous day in June.” This proves that the cyclist is very hot due to the summer heat. Another factor of the cyclist slowing down is the inconsistant of the pavement on the road “Flat road was replaced by short rolling hills.” The @CAPS2 proves that the road could be slowing the cyclist also. It seems the cyclist has a lot against him. But if he keeps his head up he can make it to “Yosemite.”.Now,   For the very first time   Don't you pay no mind   Set me free, again   To keep alive, a moment at a time   That's still inside, a whisper to a riot   The sacrifice, the knowing to survive   The first decline, another state of mind   I'm on my knees, I'm praying for a sign   Forever, whenever, I never wanna die      I never wanna die   I never wanna die   I'm on my knees, I never wanna die   I'm dancing on my grave   I'm running through the fire   Forever, whenever   I never wanna die   I never wanna leave   I'll never say goodbye   Forever, whenever   Forever, whenever      Learning to walk again   I believe I've waited long enough   Where do I begin?.Shrouding all the ground around me   Is this holy crow above me..Promises and dreams we've shared   Do you remember?.There's a reason for believing that I've never been alive , alive..Do you think I'm crazy   For considering aviation   I'm the fan of flying   Wanna do it for the nation   Cause I have nothing else to do   It's summer but committed to you   Have a big degree in philosophy   But I don't know what I wanna be      [Chorus:]   So I'm going into aviation, yeah mom   I'm going into aviation, yeah dad   Going into aviation,   I'm going into aviation      Do you think I'm crazy, cause I'm up and living baby   Well I ain't got nobody and I ain't got no money baby   I feel high as I might tonight   So lean back and enjoy the flight   And the weather is clear yeah, nobody's near   The future is....Slowly they die away at every candle's end      A thousand dark moons,   A thousand winters long..Can you feel it?"
"The features of the setting only drain the cyclist's willpower. The things he sees discourage him, for example one ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps and a corral that couldn’t hold the larnest, mule greeted me. This sight was troubling .” The desolation begins to wear away his hope of finding a building or town sometimes the things are psychologically damaging,” In an ironic twist that should please all sadists reading this, the building abandoned years earlier, by the looks of it – had been a Welch’s Grape Juice factory and bottling plant. A sand blasted picture of a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth could still be seen.” For someone who is quickly running out of water, this this irony could make one lose their resolve to continue. The snake and rolling hills slow him down, and make him use more energy. The heat dehydrates the cyclist even faster. The environment is a hostile one for a cyclist.    .Waoh Oh Oh Oh!.uncanny and immutable   This is such a happening tailpipe of a party   Like sugar, the guests are so refined   A confidence man, but why so beleaguered?.Idiot wind, blowing every time you move your teeth,   You're an idiot, babe..I just need someone to talk to..You know, of all the things in the world I'd miss   It would probably be music and love   They say you don't know what you've got 'til it's gone   That's so true   Even though we still take it for granted   And I used to be like that, but not anymore   'Cause I found out what love really means   Love means happiness and dedication   Love will sometimes bring complications   But you must have faith and a whole lot of trust   Most of all you can never give up just      (Hold on, hold on)   Hold on to your good thing, yeah   (Hold on, hold on) forget about the small things   (Hold on, hold on) do it for love, do it for love      And remember that love is a feeling   But it's also an action, yes   You've got to give sometime   If you want to get back some, well   And when all the king's horses   And even all the king's men   Can't put it together again   That is exactly when you've got to      (Hold on, hold on) hold on to what you've got   (Hold on, hold on)   It's the little things that mean a lot   (Hold on, hold on) do it for love, do it for love   In spite of everything, no matter what   You've got to H-O-L-D on (you gotta hold on)   Hold on, hmm, hmm, hmm, ooh, oh, oh      You're so hard headed   'Cause you feel that you're right   Well, tell me how you gonna feel   In the middle of the night   All alone, all alone   I know, I know   It doesn't matter who's right or wrong   If you feel so inclined   To blame that shame on someone else   Ooh, stop and think about it   Point the finger at yourself   Ooh, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo      Hold on to your good thing (hold on)   Forget about the small (hold on) things   (Hold on) And hold on   Hold on, oh hold on (hold on)   Real tight in spite of everything   Hold on (hold on)   When you feel like walking out that door..Love of a lifetime   Good for you (heart of change)   Got to be the heart of change   Good for me - a heart of change   I know we'll get it better   Stir it up (got to be)   Stir it tender heartedly   Stir it and   The whole world's gettin' better      [Bridge]   I believe the world to be   Fast and ever changing   That's the way my love will be   Got to last and satisfy me      [Chorus]   You got the love of a lifetime   You're such a rock steady lover, baby   Keep up the good love for chaka   You can hold it, boy   'cause you don't let it go      Good for you   Good for me   The way we work together   Short and sweet (hit and run)   I know where you're comin' from   We can steal   And baby, we'll hit and run together      [Bridge]      We got the love of a lifetime   Ooh, we're such rock steady lovers, baby   Keep up the good love together   We can hold it, boy   And never let it go      We got the love of a lifetime   We got to keep on rockin' steady   I really think I'm ready now   Baby, I'm burnin', burnin', burnin'      You got the love of a lifetime   You're such a rock steady lover, baby   Keep up the good love for chaka   You can hold it, boy, never let it go   We got the love of a lifetime   Ooh, we're such rock steady lovers, baby   Keep up the good love together   Hold it, boy      Love of a lifetime   (love of a lifetime)   We got the love, we got the love   We got the love   Guess it's just a heart of change   We got the love, we got the love   We got the love   It's got to be a heart of change   We got the love, we got the love....Lord, it's daddy, daddy, daddy, daddy, daddy, all the time."
"In the story, “Do not exceed postal speed limit,” many features of the setting affect the cyclist. First and most importantly, he is affected by the people who live there. “Never accept travel advice from a group of old- timers who haven’t left the confines of their porch since Carter was in office.” This quote describes the feelings the cyclist has towards the old men. Because he listened to their directions, he traveled through ghost towns and hourly died from dehydration. Also, the lack of people and civilization affected the author. There was no one around that he could ask for help from. “…but on that morning it fit the traditional definition of a ghost town. Here, the author is trying to stop for water, but since no one lives in the town any more, he gets none. Finally, the lack of water has a huge effect on the cyclist. “That smoky blues tune “Summer time” rattled around in the dry honey combs of my deteriorating brain.” This describes how the author is really dehydrated and he feels like his brain is drying up. However, his need for water makes him more determined than ever to keep going until he reaches another town, or this goal destination of reaching Yosemite National Park..It's such a pity now you want me to go!.Through the eye of a needle   Time to loosen your tounge   Got a tip how to make ends meet..You're not aware   Your hands keep still   You just don't know that I am here      It hurts too much   A pray now that soon you release   To where you belong      You touch my hand   These colors come alive   In your heart and in your mind   I cross the borders of time   Leaving today behind to be with you again      Please say my name   Remember who I am   You will find me in the world of yesterday   You drift away again   To far from where I am   When you ask me who I am      Say my name   These colors come alive   In your heart and in your mind   I cross the borders of time   Leaving today behind to be with you again      Say my name.His spirit lives and breathes in me..You're like a drug that's killing me,   I cut you out entirely,   But I get so high when I'm inside you..When things go right and his job's well done   He wants to share the prize he's won   If no one shares and no one cares   Where's the fun of a job well done, or a prize you've won?.There's a ring around the moon tonight and a chill in the air   And a fire in the stars that hang so near, so near   There's a sound in the wind that blows through the wild mountain holds   Like the sighs of a thousand crying souls, crying souls   There's a time when the traveler is fated to find   That insight has turned his gaze behind, behind   And the steps taken yesterday will beckon again   And lead to his weary journey's end, his journey's end   And in the passage from the cradle to the grave we are born, madly dancing   Rushing headlong through the crashing of the days   We run on and on without a backwards glance   We run on and on without a backwards glance   I cast my fate with the wife of Lot I turned my gaze around   Knowing neither what I sought nor what was to be found   Heeding weakness, feeding strength, oh life at length is frail   I seek again the river's source through time's dark shadowed veil   In the fast fading century, as we spin through the years   I pray that our failing vision clears, our vision clears   And in the passage from the cradle to the grave we are born, madly dancing   Rushing headlong through the crashing of the days   We run on and on without a backwards glance   We run on and on without a backwards glance   The places dash and the faces dart like fishes in a dream   Hiding 'neath the murky banks of long forgotten streams   The lines of life are never long when seen from end to end   The future's never coming, and the past has never been   There's a ring around the moon tonight, and a chill in the air   And a fire in the stars that hang so near, so near"
"Certin features of the setting affected the cyclist. In the essay by Joe Kurmaskie, he desribes he’s experiences when he cycled through the desert. ''...arrived at the first town''...it fit the traditional difinition of a ghost town. ''at first the cyclist was amused at this town and maybe a little scketle at it because the old “codgers”  told it to be thriving. Halfway through his journey the stated ''sometimes life can be so cruel.” Water was running low and he still had a ways to go untill he made it to the park and he felt as If it would never end. All that he sees aroun him as hills of nothingness under the sorching son with his limited amount of water. No buildings are around the cyclist. The ghost town and the lack of shade or soluation are very features of the setting that make that cyclist feel like a fool for taking advice from older men.        .Can't stand another day   Without you   Without the feeling   I once knew      I cry silently   I cry inside of me   I cry hopelessly   'Cause I know   I'll never breathe   Your love again   I cry   'Cause you're not   Here with me   I cry   'Cause I'm lonely   As can be   I cry hopelessly   'Cause I know   I'll never breathe   Your love again      If I could have you   Back tomorrow   If I could lose   The pain and sorrow   I would do just anything   To make you see   You still love me      I cry silently   I cry inside of me   I cry hopelessly   'Cause I know   I'll never breathe   Your love again   I cry   'Cause you're not   Here with me   I cry   'Cause I'm lonely   As can be   I cry hopelessly   'Cause I know   I'll never breathe   Your love again.I won't go away   Right here I'll stay      Stand silent in flames   Stand tall 'till it fades      Shoot me again   I ain't dead yet (x4)      Shoot me again   Shoot me again   Shoot me!.Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,   In the jingle jangle morning I'll come followin' you..gladly tread the narrow path   While light and grace are given   Who meekly follow Christ on earth   Shall reign with Him in Heaven....Love, for me is not a game   Don't play a trick again, it's over now, is it forever   Don't hurt my heart      Oh I thought you are the girl out of my dreams   I'll be there for you oh baby now it seems   You're the one who quit this love and let me go   Is it over now, I have to know      Girl, oh why you changed your mind   There's a way we'll find, but why, you're gone, is it forever?.Our love, our hope never faded away   This fire   This fire burning, it burns inside of me      Build a fire for yourself..Hey!"
"The features of the setting affect the cyclist in a few ways. first of these is the blazing heat. He is basically in a desert and he is running low on water. As he starts to run out of water he starts conserving it which is dehydrating him so he is becoming weaker, “I would conserve my water and go inward for an hour or so- a test of my inner spirit. Next up is the rough terrain. When you hit rough terrain on a bike it can get hard to keep going and the cyclist was already short on water “a large highway sign jumped out at me. I read: rough road ahad: Do not exceed posted speed limit sometimes life can be so cruel“. Finally is the structure First there was the Ghost town with the “battery acid” tasting water. Also there was the Welch’s grape Juice factory and bottling plant which were both probably dimeriling. “A sandblusted picture of a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth could still be seen. I hung my head”. As you can see the features of the settings generily affected the cyclist..Something in your eyes was so exciting,   And in your smile, ooh, inviting..Miner   Thank you Mr..Darling let's turn back my years   And go back to yesterday   Let's pretend that time has stopped   And I didn't go away..A gorgeous georgian lady, is quite a sight to see,   For some splendid beauty tips, pay attention listen to me..Brown brown is the sky..I'd give anything to give me to you   Can you forget the world that you thought you knew?.Remember those golden days   We used to walk hand in hand   I was your friend, your fool, your lover   I was your man      I can see you then   Smiling, looking straight at me   You caught me unawares, I blushed   Let's sit beneath this tree      I can't get over the change in you   I can't get over the change in me      And I keep on remembering the old days   I keep on remembering the old ways      I can recall you running to a sweet shop   You stopped   Bought me something   And you handed it to me      You were my girlfriend then   The first that I ever had   The first that I ever kissed   And the first to make me sad      I can't get over the change in you   I can't get over the change in me      I keep on remembering the old days   I keep on remembering the old ways      Oh yeah   I keep on remembering   I keep on remembering      Oh yeah   I keep on remembering the old days   I keep on remembering      Your pretty dress   With the zip up the back   I used to love you like that   I used to love you like that      Oh yeah   I keep on remembering   I keep on remembering all about you"
"The conditions for the cyclist in the story “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” are pretty dangerous. “a ridiculously large snake blocked the majority of the pavement balance my dehydrated state bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips” (kurmaskie, @NUM1). There was a rather large snake in his path. You can tell he isn’t an expert on snakes because he couldn’t identify it. Because he is in the desert on a long bike ride, he is dehydrated. His water supply is almost gone. The cyclist feared many dangerous challenges in his journey..[Chorus]   It's something thrilling for you, so get on, get on it (come ride The Tempest)   You got that feelin in you, so jump up, jump on

"The features of the setting  affect the cyclist in many ways. The setting was a dry California desert, for if it had been a busting city, the events in the story would have not happened. The author asked a group of old men for directions to Yosemite National Park, and , “like a foolish yuuth,” folluwed their advice. Everything started out fine until he reached the second town. He –ans almost dehydrated and “in an ironic twist” he reached on abandoned grape juice foctary. Almost all hope was lost for him until he rounded the bend and came across his new hope: “Gary and Wilber’s Fish camp-if you wont bait pur the big ones, we’re your best bet “ in He end he learned tostick to a map instead of old people who “haven’t left the confines of their purchess,hce carter was ,h office”.He embarrasses his child and wife   Lord he leads a miserable life   But still he thinks the bottle is his right hand   Yes and he can tear down more   Than he's ever built before   A man can be a drunk sometimes   But a drunk can't be a man      He lets his business lag behind   For the nightlife he can find   Why he does all this he'll never understand   And in the morning when he wakes up   Lord he can't wait to fill his cup   A man can be a drunk sometimes   But a drunk can't be a man      For he goes from Doctor Jekyll to Mr.Hyde   He seem proud to have a devil for his guide   Still he keeps on reaching out   Lord he needs a helping hand   But a man can be a drunk sometimes   But a drunk can't be a man   Yes a man can be a drunk sometimes   But a drunk can't be a man.The winds of war..There's a whole n'other conversation going on   In a parralell universe   Where nothig breaks and nothing hurts   There's a waltz playing frozen in time   Blades of grass on tiny bare feet   I look at you and you're looking at me      Could you beam me up,   Give me a minute, I don't know what I'd say in it   Probably just stare, happy just to be there holding your face   Beam me up,   Let me be lighter, tired of being a fighter,   I think, a minutes enough,   Just beam me up..People saving whales   And giving your thanks to our seas   My respect to the ones in the forest   Standing up for our old trees   Them giving food to the hungry   Giving hope to the needy   Giving life to a baby, giving care for free   'Cause there is freedom around us   We have everything we need and I will care for you   'Cause you care for me   And we all have opinions, some of them get through   But there's better people with more good to do, good to do   What I have could be a message   Or just some words from my heart   My respect to the ones making changes   For all the lives they'll give their all   Like giving food to the hungry   Giving hope to the needy   Giving life to a baby, giving care for free   'Cause there is freedom around us   We have everything we need and I will care for you   'Cause you cared for me   And we all have opinions, some of them get through   But there's better people with more good to do, good to do   When our world keeps spinning round and round it goes   Mother Nature keeps spreading its disease   And our children keep growing up with   What they know through what we teach and what they see   And so only a question of the time we have   And the lives that our children need   As they can only keep growing up with   What they know through what we teach and what they see   Like giving food to the hungry   Giving hope to the needy   Giving life to a baby, giving care for free   'Cause there is freedom around us   We have everything we need and I will care for you   'Cause you care for me   We all have opinions, some of them get through   But there's better people with more good to do, good to do   Oh good to do.Or is it afraid enough?.Never fall for prophecies..Barbarisms by barbaras   With pointed heels   Victorious victorious kneel   For brand new spankin' deals      Marching forward hypocritic and   Hypnotic computers   You depend on our protection   Yet you feed us lies from the tablecloth      Everybody's going to the party, have a real good time   Dancing in the desert, blowing up the sunshine      Kneeling roses disappearing into   Moses' dry mouth   Breaking into fort knox stealing   Our intentions      Hangers sitting dripped in oil   Crying freedom   Handed to obsoletion   Still you feed us lies from the tablecloth      Everybody's going to the party, have a real good time   Dancing in the desert, blowing up the sunshine      Everybody's going to the party, have a real good time   Dancing in the desert, blowing up the sunshine      Blast off!"
"The features of the setting extremely affect the adjust in the ride to the meet town. It was bad enough that the adjust the out of water but on top of that by faced, rolling wills, makes and hard road condition all of these setting played a huge will in the cyclist puformance, ""it motued the terrain changing. that way was replaced by that rolling hills."" He also says ""tumbleweed around my matt and a includesouly change snake it really did look like a demand luck blocked the majority of the movement in front of me. These setting made it difficult for the adjust to reform because the hills snakes and tumbleweed disturbed the adjust to advanced in the ride. He ran out of water no it was hard to reduce up will and the night of a deadly snake made the adjust named and worked to the difficulty of pufornenance for the cyclist.Oh baby, baby, does she take a piece of lime   For the drink that I'mma buy her, do you know just what she likes?.You won't believe all of the things that she put me through..That night he pictured the removal of his hairy heart and to the accompaniment of very romantic music he watched it being shaved smooth by an anonymous stainless steel razor..Well, I'll cry every time   That you slip in one more dime   And let the boy sing the sad song one,   One more time..I'm fortune tellin', you're not buying what I'm sellin', if that look is a cry... then call me a villain....Come on now pretty baby darling come on home   You know I love you baby, I got to get you all alone..Baby, look here at me   Have you ever seen me this way   I've been fumblin' for words   Through the tears and the hurt and the pain   I'm gonna lay it all out   On the line tonight   And I think that it's time   To tell this uphill fight goodbye      [Chorus:]   Have ever had to love someone   That just don't feel the same   Tryin' to make somebody care for you   The way I do   Is like tryin' to catch the rain   And if love is really forever   I'm a winner at a losin' game      I know that baby, you tried   To find me somewhere inside of you   But you know you can't lie   Girl, you can't hide the truth   Sometimes two hearts   Just can't dance to the same beat   So I'll pack up my things   And I'll take what remains of me      [Chorus]      I know that I'll never be the man that you need or love   Yeah, baby it's killin' me to stand here and see   I'm not what you've been dreamin' of      [Chorus]      Oh, oh, if love is really forever   I'm a winner at a losin' game   Ooo, I'm tired of losing   Oh, oh, oh"
"The features of the setting make the cyclist feel hopeless after realizing he is not on a short cut. The cyclist has the ""growing realization that [he] could drop from heatstroke"" as he rides along. Also, the only building he sees for miles ""had been @NUM1 Welch's Grape Juice Factory."" The cyclist is driven deeper into despair and feels that all hope is lost when he sees this building. As he rides on, the song ""'@ORGANIZATION2' rattled aroung in the dry honeycombs of (his) deteriorating brain."" At this point, the cyclist believes his own death to be inevitable. He saysown death to be inevitable. He says “with any luck I’d hit a bump and lodge one in my throat” when talking about pebbles he placed in his mouth. Finally, the cyclist reaches a small bait shop, and all hope is returned as he “drank deeply from the sink.” The desert setting, with its lack of water, shelter, and people was the cause of this mans concern and later panic about his own life. The hopelessness of this cyclist is much like the hopelessness of those in the @ORGANIZATION1, who trapped in a blizzard far from civilization, resorted to eating their dead just to survive. While the @PERSON1 @ORGANIZATION1 went to extremes for their survival, their setting caused them to feel the same hopelessness as the cyclist..I can't stop singing   I can't see the end   Just a new beginning   As long as I keep on trying   I'll survive just fine   Free to take my time      Ridin' the moon in the midnight sky   I can see through   The man who lies with eyes   And the real thing that's wrong is   He has no song to lean on   So I'll take my time   Just to give you my rhyme   To try to be sure and open the door   'Cause there's much more to life   Than a day and a night to dream on      Now I ain't confessin'   To same kind of blessin'   I'm trying to say   Why I'm happy today   I'm not preachin', teachin',   Makin' some speech in dedication   'Cause it's no good me sayin'   Where the blame should be layin'   For with that kind of reason   It comes out the same   With an ear to the ground   Each day I found inspiration.Sun-tanned children sleeping   Hoping Santa will come through   Christmas morning boy they're leaping   Oh, it's Bubba's Birthday   Mr Buffett's birthday too!.Gyal weh fava duppy story!.Sometimes my life   Is just a torch   They go away   And come back to me   It's just no way   It can be found   It's a view   Come on take it   The touch of your hand   It speaks the distance   It speaks the distance   In your heart   Behind my life   There's a silent storm   It brings a vision   Into your mind   It's in between   All the dark of hearts   My heart beats and say   Come on, there's question of why   There's no question of why   Beat your door   To knock it through   You took his watch   His solitude   In my eyes   It may be   Behind my eyes   There's different kinds   They go away   And come back to me.Here we are   What is left of a husband and a wife with four good kids   Who have a way of gettin on with their lives   And I'm not old but I'm getting a whole lot older every day   It's too late to keep from goin' crazy   I've got to get away      The reasons that I can't stay, don't have a thing to do with being in love   And I understand that lovin' a man shouldn't have to be this rough   And you ain't the only one who feels like this world's left you far behind   I don't know why you gotta be angry all the time      Our boys are strong now, the spittin' image of you when you were young   I hope someday they can see past what you have become   I remember every time I said I'd never leave   But what I can't live with is memories of the way you used to be      The reasons that I can't stay, don't have a thing to do with being in love   I understand that lovin a man shouldn't have to be this rough   You ain't the only one who feels like this world's left you far behind   I don't know why you gotta be angry all the time      Twenty years, have came and went, since I walked out of your door   I never quite made it back, to the one I was before   And God it hurts me to think of you   For the light in your eyes was gone   And sometimes I don't know why this old world can't leave well enough alone      The reasons that I can't stay, don't have a thing to do with being in love   And I understand that lovin, a man shouldn't have to be this rough   You ain't the only one who feels like this world's left you far behind   I don't know why you gotta be angry all the time [Repeat x3].but where there's love there is nothing to   Fear..When rain has hung the leaves with tears,   I want you near, to kill my fears,   To help me to leave all my blues behind."
"The setting of this story is a dry, hot desert in the middle of June. These features of the setting, effect the author, because it shows how he starts of strong + determained and his left weak + doubtful. In the begining of the story, the author says, “Things began well enough. I rode into the morning with strong legs and a smile on my face.” This is showing the readers confidence he has with himself before starting his trip. Later on in the story, he discribes the setting as “the high deserts of California in June.” He is discribing the heat + what he is facing. It goes on to tell how he is dehydrated in worn out. But he comes to a town, ""cool water drippen from my head as I slumped against the wall."" @CAPS1 he is relieved. As the setting changes, the authors attitude changes as well..Its just all those, simple things like to be cared for..And wrote on the card ""I love you."".Went out walkin' through the wood the other day   Can't you see the furrows in my forehead?.Can't be   They must be talking to themselves hoe, hands free   Yeah, and I'm just filling up this daily planner   Gettin' busy 'cause I'm a star, no spangled banner   Jealous dudes get to talkin' in they music   And I just say I wrote it for your girlfriends, Kelsey Grammar   Yeah, that's what life becomes when you're doing you   Welcome to Hollywood, don't let this town ruin you,   And if you pillow talking with the women that are screwin' you   Just know that she gon' tell another nigga when she through wit' you   Don't get impatient when it takes too long   Drink it all even when it tastes too strong   Yeah, I gotta feel alive, even if it kills me   Promise to always give you me, the real me      Who would have thought   I'd be caught in this life?.You know I was out on the streets talking and talking,   Doing all that shit, and every time I found a nice piece of talent   He went right straight downstairs to the chick on the second floor,   There was another chick on the second floor, right..I know that I can be the meanest person in the world..

"The terrain in “Do not exeed posted speed limit” by Joe Kurmaskie the cyclist had to cope with many difficulties. He was already lacking water from the anduous journey and then the enviroment turned against him. The narration states, “I noticed the terrain changing flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.”(Kurmaskie @NUM1). This means the cyclist is going to put forth more energy to make it up these hills. Energy he barely has. This  will drain almost all the energy the cyclist has. Another example is, “At some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path”(Kurmaskie @NUM1). This means that the cyclist is in the middle of nowhere with barely any water and energy, causing even more problems. In conclusion, the setting in, “Do not exceed posted speed limit” by Joe Kurmaskie caused many problems for the cyclist.  .When you kissed my fingers and you made me love you   When you kissed my fingers and you made me love you      Last night I dreamed   Last night I dreamed darkly nurtured dreams   None of them, none as frightening   Oh, awake empty and out of sleep   You were beside me gently breathing   Last night I dreamed you didn't love me      You didn't love me   You didn't love me   Why don't you love me like you used to?.(""Sonar says ?.Oh one look and I yelled timber..Pretty baby, baby   I'm beggin' lady, lady   Take me to the top now   And I'll take you higher..Kim   Please tell me you're not married   You don't know, you can't know what I've done to be here      Ellen   You don't know how he needed a new start      Kim   I feel walls in my heart   Closing in   I can't breathe   I can't win      Ellen   As for the child   You say it's Chris's      Kim   Oh yes, Madame   My son is Chris's   I had a dream for my son to belong   And not live his life in the streets like a rat      Ellen   We aren't rich, but we'll shoulder our load   Chris and I are totally together on that      Kim   Then you must take Tam with you      Ellen   Take a child from his mother, impossible Kim      Kim   You will take Tam with you   Then he'll get what I wanted for him      Ellen   But Kim, your child needs you   Chris is married to me, we want kids of our own      Kim   Tam's chance lies with you now, not with me      Both   No!.Walkin' around   Out of a town   Walkin' it out   When you want to   Soldiering my style is smiling   Turn it into whatever I've chosen   Take me now to the water      Don't be late I hear it   Gonna be so very great and   Out the door I'm a walking like a runaway   All the reasons that I count of you can hold away   More and more I'm a walking like a runaway      Kick it around   Stare at the ground   Breakin' it down   When you want to   Soldiering my days I've chosen   Dancing round do whatever I want to   Take me now it's the water      Don't be late I hear it   Gonna be so very great and   Out the door I'm a walking like a runaway   All the reasons that I count of you can hold away   More and more I'm a walking like a runaway      I think I know, everything you gonna say   I think you know, don't want to runaway      Don't be late I hear it   Gonna be so very great and   Out the door I'm a walking like a runaway   All the reasons that I count of you can hold away   More and more I'm a walking like a runaway      All the reasons that I count of you can hold away   More and more I'm a walking like a runaway   More and more I'm a walking like a runaway   Out the door I'm a walking like a runaway.I was walkin' by the river   I held my hand out to feel the rain      Just a light rain   Almost a sun shower   Makin'all things shine again      And I felt like I belonged   I felt so strong   As I walked on      There was rhythm   And there was order   There was a balance   There was a flow      There was patience   Indulgence   There was a power   I could not know      And I felt it all made sense   The innocence   The permanence      I took my young son to the river   I held his hand out to feel the rain"
"The features of the setting affect of the cyclist because the setting changed so drastically. The flat wide open road turned into to “short, rolling hills”. Because he was already running out of water it was making harder for him to have the will power and determination to go up and down these hills. His determination started to fade because he started to see wide open lands with nothing but “tumbleweeds and ridiculously large snakes.” He felt like he was going to dehydrate because the sun was beating down and had no water left. He used pebbles that he had found to put in his mouth to help circulate the saliva he had in his mouth. He wishes that he would choke on one because he feels so useless. .I'm with you   You   Now I see keeping everything inside   You   Now I see   Even when I close my eyes   I hit you and you hit me back   We fall to the floor, the rest of the day stands still   Fine line between this and that   When things go wrong I pretend the past isn't real   Now I'm trapped in this memory   And I'm left in the wake of the mistake, slow to react   So even though you're close to me   You're still so distant   And I can't bring you back   It's true the way I feel   Was promised by your face   The sound of your voice   Painted on my memories   Even if you're not with me   I'm with you   It's all I can do      The city's flooding   And our love turns to rust   We're beaten and blown by the wind   Trampled in dust   I'll show you a place   High on a desert plain   Where the streets have no name.(Chourus)   (Degeneration X part doubles)   Think you can tell me what to do?.Get rich (get rich), or die tryin' (die tryin)..Dog with a bone.Cause if I'm not in love with you then there's no chance to see this through   Again..(La la la-la la-la la la la la)   (La la la-la la-la la-ee-oh-da)      Hey!.Granny, granny, what on earth can I do?"
"The features of the setting affected the cyclist in many was. First, the “town” The cyclist first comes upon is described as a ghost town. Although the cyclist chuckles about it, this setting sets up the long journey the cyclist has a head of him. There were other features that would negatively affect the cyclist. For example, “…I noticed the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.” (pg @NUM1). Flat land is much easier for a cyclist to pedal on. The change from flat land to hills affected his stamena and will to keep going. He really had to push himself to trudge up and down each hill. His determination finally led him to, “Gary and Wilber’s Fish camp…” (pg @NUM2). He finally found hope.   .There's a place where the streets shine   With the glory of the Lamb   There's a way we can go there   We can live there, be on time      Because of You, because of You   Because of Your love, because of Your blood      No more pain no more sadness   No more suffering, no more tears   No more sin, no more sickness   No injustice, no more death      Because of You, because of You   Because of Your love, because of Your blood      Oh, our sins are washed away   And we can live forever   Now we have this hope   Because of You      Oh, we'll see You face to face   And we'll dance together   In the city of our God   Because of You   True, true, true      There'll be joy everlasting   There'll be gladness, there'll be peace   There'll be wine ever flowing   There's a wedding, there's a feast      Because of You, because of You   Because of Your love, because of Your blood      Oh, our sins are washed away   And we can live forever   Now we have this hope   Because of You      Oh, we'll see You face to face   And we'll dance together   In the city of our God   Because of You      Oh, our sins are washed away   And we can live forever   Now we have this hope   Because of You      Oh, we'll see You face to face   And we'll dance together   In the city of our God   Because of You      There's a place where the streets shine   With the glory of the Lamb   There's a way we can go there   We can live there be on time      No more pain no more sadness   No more suffering, no more tears   No more sin, no more sickness   No injustice, no more death      There is joy everlasting   There is gladness, there is peace   There'll be wine ever flowing   There's a wedding, there's a feast.You're the anchor that holds me down   When my ship is sinking, you won't let me drown      Sad, but one day our kids will have to visit museums   To see what a lady looks like   So if you find one, I beg you, hold her tight   If you spot one, good sir, treat her right   This is Benjamin Andre signing off   Thanks a million   Good luck and goodnight..Some prayed and cursed, then cursed and prayed   And then they prayed some more..I live by the river   And I hide my house away   Then just like the river   I can change my ways   Oh, if you come to love me   You would stay forever   Inside my heart   Inside my dreams   And time will fade   In time we'll love      In the street we walk as beggars   In the alley faithless kings   Ah, but it's the truth of life   That chains us in between   Those lost moments we steal   To keep our love alive   And our prize so tired after all the pain   And time will fade   In time we'll love.How is your heart little darling?.She ain't no good for you..A one sided love   Would break my heart   He may be just acting   And playing a part      If he don't love me   Let him tell me so   And I, I can't hold him   If he wants to go      And though, though   I'll cry when he's gone   And I won't die and I'll live on   If it's so, it's too soon   Way too soon to know      Does he love me?"
"As if along bike ride through the city isn’t grueling enough, the author of this story had it much worse. First the climate was a recipe for a disaster. “High deserts of California in June.” @CAPS1 is clearly a debilitating factor as is direct sunlight and humidity. If the cyclist did not have the proper gean he could be hurt by all three of these factors. Secondly, “Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.” @CAPS2 his endurance is being tested because it is going for tolerance energy and will power to climb each individual hill. Most importantly, with his lack of water in his bottles, all of these characteristics were harmful. Within a desert, water is to be found nowhere. In hot weather, the water bottles will turn warm and in sunlight, water could even evaporate. To me, it seems like the setting and the weather were the perfect combination for doing much more harm than good..Watching my dreams turning to ashes   And my hopes into bits of clay      Once I could see   Once I could feel   Now I am numb   I've become unreal   I walk the night   Without a goal   Stripped of my heart and my soul      What now my love?.See how I fall   (""Fall!"").Cut myself open wide   Breach inside   Help yourself   To all I have to give   And then you help yourself again   And then complain   That you didn't like the way   I put the knife in wrong   You didn't like the way   My blood spilled on your brand new floor      What would you say   If I walked away   Would you appreciate   But then it'd be too late   Because I can only take so much   Of your ungrateful ways   Everything is never enough      Sacrifice my life   Neglect my kids and wife   All for you to be happy   All those sleepness nights   And countless fights to give you more   And then you say how dare that   I didn't write you back   I must be too good for you   I only care about myself      What would you say   If I walked away   Would you appreciate   But then it'd be too late   Because I can only take so much   Of your ungrateful ways   Everything is never enough      What would you say   If I walked away   Would you appreciate   But then it'd be too late   Because I can only take so much   Of your ungrateful ways   Everything is never enough.Fall Into You   David Hodges feat..Were you there when they nailed him to the tree?.That I have left without a trace..Close your eyes and try to get to sleep   Now don't you make a peep   Now we hear everything   Shut the door and make it clean and neat   Now you've been so discreet   Now we've seen everything inside your heart of hearts   You know pick yourself up off the floor   And stand now wash away your sin   Now you've got everything      Inside your heart of hearts   You know will you choose to hide it in your soul?"
"The features surrounding the cyclist effect him greatly. All he has around him are hills, rough terraine, sand + tumble weeds. These features leave him thinking he will die because there is no life around him. Everything is dry + vivid + thats how it makes him feel.

"The features of the setting in which the cyclist is in change his outlook on the trip. When he first begins his trip, the road is fine, so he becomes confident. When the terrain began to change, he writes, “sometimes life can feel so cruel”, he grows despairing as he faces new terrain with so little water. When he begins to see a building, he becomes hopeful and determined. However, when he realizes its old juice factory, he grows bitter. When he leaves the factory, he feels ??? all hope. The comparison can be shown when he writes, “somehow i climbed away from the abandoned factory of of juice and dreams, slowly gaining elevation while losing hope."" @CAPS1 the end, when he is revived with water he almost looks back on the journey comically. The rider knows that his out look drastically changed depending on setting through his journey.Oh, please   Say you're not intending to tease   Speed that happy ending and please,   Tell me that you love me too..Min hasreyfah   Lamah lib'or levad?.You fell into our arms..Come away from this mess,   Come away with me, my love!.(Chorus)   But you were there, and you were everything I'd never seen..(Yeah!.I'm gulping smoke to fade away."
"In the story, the cyclist iS greatly affected by the features of the setting. For example, the setting has no thing for miles. Just ghost towns, makes it imposible to find any water. Also it’s a desert like setting, adding to his thirst. Another example is the hills, that made him even more thirsty. It was June in California so it must have been pretty hot and also the town that he are to had no water because they seemed desorted. Another example is the state he put under his tongue. It’s a trick that lets you survive alot more effectively.

"In Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit, the features of the setting are devastating to the cyclists condition. ""@CAPS1 through the high desert of California"" is surely never an easy task to begin with. Without proper hydration, people often suffer heatstrokes or pass out, sometimes even perishing, it is entirely worse for this cyclist because of the effort he is exerting, pedaling over “short, rolling hills.” Even worse, the trail a few very old, eccentric men set run on doesn’t do much in the way of nuping with a depleted water supply. The first town the cyclist comes across easily splits “the traditional definition of a ghost town” and the only other water pump he comes to emits only sewage and incredibly hot brackish water. Therefore, the heat is only made worse by the look of water on the cyclist path. This combination of features in then setting causes a great deal of distress to the cycling, and almost pushing him to death..Here comes the summer   Mighty mighty summer   Here comes the summer   We're gonna have a good time      Gonna have a good time   We're gonna have a good time   When the summer comes      Here come the woman   Mighty mighty woman   Here comes the woman   Gonna get a surprise      Gonna get a surprise   Gonna get a surprise   When the woman comes      We're gonna get a surprise   W'ere gonna have a good time   We're gonna get a surprise   We're gonna get a sruprise      Here comes the summer   Here comes the summer   Nothing but summer   Tell me what could be more real   Than the whisper of the wind   And the sunlight that I feel      Here comes the leader   The mighty mighty leader   He's got a penis   A mighty mighty penis   There's gonna be an attack   There's going to be an attack   When the summer come      Here come the people   The mighty mighty people   Here come the people   We wanna have a good time      They're gonna be some power   We're gonna get some power   When the people come      We're gonna have a good time   We're gonna have a good time   When the summer comes.I got no friends 'cause they read the papers..listen to the   Fairy tales of million dollar happiness,   Los Angelistic lifestyle drinking   Chardonnay over a lobster salad brunch      Do do do do   Do do do do   Do do do do   Do do do do      The pursuit of million dollar happiness      Happiness was killed we watched it bleed, some say it died from hate   Some say from bleeding heart disease.Ariana!.And just like the song said: Carpe Diem!.I really mean to learn   'Cause we're living in a world of fools   Breaking us down when they all should let us be   We belong to you and me      I believe in you   You know the door to my very soul   You're the light in my deepest, darkest hour   You're my savior when I fall   And you may not think I care for you   When you know down inside that I really do   And it's me you need to show      How deep is your love, how deep is your love   How deep is your love?.'Cause I'm tired of thinkin', and too much drinkin', all my troubles away."
"The author’s setting described a difficult terrain and harsh weather for bike riding. The author said that it was early summer which means it could be hot and uncomfortable weather for the cyclist. The author also that when the cyclist reached the first town, the sun began to heat down. That means the temperature is going to rise since the sun is getting stronger. Riding a bike in hot weather is very difficult because it takes a lot of effort and makes your body dehydrate faster because the heat makes you sweat which lowers your water retention. Another feature of the setting that the author described was the cyclist’s location. He was traveling through the high deserts of California. This gives you a sense of how much hotter it is since he’s traveling through deserts during early summer while the sun is high. After the first couple town, he starts to ride on short, rolling hills. Hills take a bigger toll on a person’s body because it takes more effort to pedal up a hill..Remember two wrongs don't make a right, it'll only make things tougher..Birds do it, bees do it   Even educated fleas do it   Let's do it, let's fall in love      In Spain, the best upper sets do it   Lithuanians and let's do it   Let's do it, let's fall in love      The dutch in old Amsterdam do it   Not to mention the fins   Folks in Siam do it, think of Siamese twins      Some Argentines, without means, do it   People say in Boston even beans do it   Let's do it, let's fall in love      Romantic sponges, they say, do it   Oysters down in oyster bay do it   Let's do it, let's fall in love      Cold cape cod clams, 'gainst their wish, do it   Even lazy jellyfish, do it   Let's do it, let's fall in love      Electric eels I might add do it   Though it shocks em I know   Why ask if shad do it, waiter bring me   ""shad roe""      In shallow shoals english soles do it   Goldfish in the privacy of bowls do it   Let's do it, let's fall in love      In old Japan, all the Japs do it   Up in Lapland little laps do it   Let's do it, let's fall in love      The chimpanzees in the zoos do it   Some courageous kangaroos do it   Let's do it, let's   Fall in love      I'm sure giraffes on the sly do it   Even eagles as they fly do it   Let's do it, let's fall   In love      Electric eels I might add do it   Though it shocks em I know   Why ask if shad do it, garcon de   ""shad roe""      The world admits bears in pits do it   Even pekingeses at the Ritz do it   Let's do it, let's   Fall in love      The royal set sans regret did it   And they considered it fun   Marie Antoinette did it   With or without napoleon.Here I am Lord, Is it I Lord?.I know there's hurt, I know there's pain   But people change, Lord knows I've been no saint   In my own way, regret choices I've made   How do I say I'm sorry?.If you need me I'll always be there..We can live in fear..But momma she never told me a lie -   Momma she never told me a lie."
"Many of the features of the setting effect the cyclist. The most obvious and direct feature would be that this adventure took place in the “high deserts of California in June.” @CAPS1 about that passage says blistering heat; high meaning its going to be closer to sun, deserts, where the world is hot, California, which is known to be smoggy, and June, which is the middle of summer. Also, the closet water supply was “somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees,” there was a “long crippling hill” all while the sun was heating down.  All of that would most obviously effect the cyclists by making him tired, which he vividly explains by expressing his fears of losing conscionous..Camelback cinema..Married to the game   She even got a wedding ring   Six white cars and I put that on everything   White Benz   White Porsche   White bent   White range   White vet   White brains      All white everything   All white everything   All white everything   I'm 'bout to kill 'em this summer   I'm doin' all white everything      All white everything   All white everything   All white everything   I'm 'bout to kill 'em this summer   I'm doin' all white everything      I gotta white bent   White pit   Even gotta white bitch   Wen I say white I mean whiter den a light switch   White this, white that in my white sox hat   Used 2 hide dem white packs where my white socks at   Niggas say he so white he tellin a white lie   Neva sold no white and he ain't neva see a white pie   Man I swear to god I'm being followed by a white guy   On ya boy man I mean harder den a white tie   White roll white wheels whiter den some white pills   White s550 sittin on some white hills   Niggas thinkin furs 4 da winter I'm thinkin white fox   Pull up in the white ford dually on sum white shocks      Married to the game   She even got a wedding ring   Six white cars and I put that on everything   White Benz   White Porsche   White bent   White range   White vet   White brains      All white everything   All white everything   All white everything   I'm 'bout to kill 'em this summer   I'm doin' all white everything      All white everything   All white everything   All white everything   I'm 'bout to kill 'em this summer   I'm doin' all white everything      I gotta white lac, white lade both got white suede   Big white crib, inside gotta white maid   White sinks, white towels, white rags, white tiles   Wen I say white I mean whiter den da white house   White couch, white pillows, white candles, white rugs   Since we talkin white jus know I had a white plug   White doors, white walls even got sum white halls   Bathroom coat white floors in the white stall   White man, white yard, white trees, white leaves   Go and get my mail in a pair of white spike lees   Ya'll think I'm trippin wen I say I want a white horse   Right inside the 5-9-9 I see the white porsche      Married to the game   She even got a wedding ring   Six white cars and I put that on everything   White Benz   White Porsche   White bent   White range   White vet   White brains      All white everything   All white everything   All white everything   I'm 'bout to kill 'em this summer   I'm doin' all white everything      All white everything   All white everything   All white everything   I'm 'bout to kill 'em this summer   I'm doin' all white everything      I gotta all white harley jets even match my boat man   Get dem white boy checks ask my white postman   White socks, white draws, polo white tee   Triple white turbo ooh I think she like me   Past right by a white flash like wat was that?.Dead bodies!.When I look into the mirror   Just can't believe, what do I see   There's no wakin' from this nightmare   And you're lost in your reality      So you tell me all your secrets   And you tell me that you're innocent   There's something in your eyes I can see   And my face keeps looking back at me      You Confess   You can't help yourself   This living lie that you can't go on   You're possessed   You can't fool yourself   You're the crime and you can't go on      Another day, another sorrow   No today and no tomorrow   Try and wash away the shame   And you smile in your picture frame      You had a charmed life, but you think from grace   And you're long gone without a trace   You're all alone and wonder why   And you laugh when you want to cry      You Confess   You can't help yourself   This living lie that you can't go on   You're possessed   You can't fool yourself   You're the crime and you can't go on      You Confess   You can't help yourself   This living lie that you can't go on   You're possessed   You can't fool yourself   You're the crime and it can't go on   It can't go on      God never spoke to me about your sin   So livin' in our lies will test the faith   So cut your straight lines on the mirror   And dip your hands in holy water   Try and wash away the shame   'cause all you've got is your father's name   (repeat choruses).You made me cry when you said good-bye..I'm gonna crawl in your window   And no one is ever gonna know,   I'm gonna come and take control   That's the deal!.Joey, Joey,   King of the streets, child of clay."
"The features of the setting affect the cyclist for a few reasons. One reason is that it makes it easier to picture how the cyclist feels. Also it makes the cyclist seem a bit insane for doing what he’s doing in weather that he could, “drop from heatstroke.” @CAPS1 reason is that the weather is affecting the cyclist so bad that he’s seeing a mirage of a “building-abandoned years ealier.” The features of the setting affect the cyclist because the conditions seem impossible to make it in..Yes sir!.So let me sing this party song      From the bottom of my hearty..If you believe in me..While I'm far away from you my baby   I know it's hard for you my baby   Because it's hard for me my baby   And the darkest hour is just before dawn      Each night before you go to bed my baby   Whisper a little prayer for me my baby   And tell all the stars above   This is dedicated to the one I love      Life can never be   Exactly like we want it to be   It makes me happy   Just knowing that you love me   There's one thing I want you to do   Especially for me   And it's something that everybody needs      Each night before you go to bed my baby   Whisper a little prayer for me my baby   And tell all the stars above   This is dedicated to the one I love.-""Where is it?.They'd hose him down with water, and steal his little friends..They're living on nuts and berries      They want to know what's best   They're making a fool of us   They ought to be more careful   They're setting a bad example      They like to laugh at people   They're setting a bad example   They have untroubled lives   They think every thing's nice      They say they don't need money   They say animals don't worry   They're living on nuts and berries   You know animals are hairy?"
"The desert is the crulest of nature’s environments. Its lack of water, dry air, and punishing heat are enough to kill even the hardiest creature. When traveling through a desert, one must maintain a constant water supply and know their path with respect to the power of nature in “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit”, cycler Joe Kurmaskie must overcome the desert’s heat and lack of water to survive. As the author observes in paragraph @NUM1, “wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, I could drop from heatstroke.” If the human body overheats, it becomes sick and unable to properly function. When in the desert one must keep cool or perish. In @NUM2, Kurmaskie begins to realize the danger of running out of water in the desert, “ I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly, and I was travelling through the high deserts of California in June. “As this water starts to run out, Joe suffers from dehydration, despair, and a loss of balance. Water is essential in a desert environment, without it, as Joe observes, “the birds would pick (you) clean, leaving only some expensive out door gear”..Feelin' good was easy lord, when bobby sang the blues..She offered back nothin' but lack of respect   So he left himself out with two barrels of steel..Well, I seen the whole country through   Just to find Gypsy Lou   Seen it up, seen it down   Followin' Gypsy Lou around..(Break ya off?).Daddy, daddy, daddy ..Across the room your silhouette starts to make it's way to me   The playful conversation starts   Counter all your quick remarks like passing notes in secrecy   All I can say is it was enchanting to meet you   Oh taylor I was so enchanted to meet you too      This night is sparkling, don't you let it go   I'm wonderstruck, blushing all the way home   I'll spend forever wondering if you knew   I was enchanted to meet you too      The lingering question kept me up   2am, who do you love?.With songs of fear and bigotry   A cruel, hypnotic sound   He plays his last tune greedily   And strikes the children down."
"The story Rough Road ahead: Do not exceed Posted Speed limit"" by Joe Kurmaskie was about a man traveling through some pretty difficult settings. The cyclist’s mood was detirmined by the setting as well as his needs and his detirmination to make it. The setting of the story early summer in California. The weather is described as hot as, ""The sun [began] to beat down."" He, ""was traveling through the high deserts of @CAPS1 can June."" Because of the excessive heat, he needed more water, which shortly became the conflict of this story. As things got more difficult his attitude towards the old men’s advice changed from gracious for their help to wishing he had never listened to them. Also as the difficulty increased his detirmination to move on also increased by, ""telling [himself] if [he] could make it that far, [he’d] be fine."" @CAPS2 for the cyclist, the settings affect was negitive.     .Make me feel safe from harm      Oh just take me, free me, see through to the core of me   Take me, free me, there will be no more pretending      I am temperamental   And I have imperfections   And I am emotional   There'll be no more pretending.Well in no time He seen the world was knockin' on His door   Performed miracles and wonders they had never see before   Soon the Pharasees stopped laughin   The silver sun was paid   And near the end He knelt down in the garden and He prayed:      I'm just a kid   That's all I am   I'll need Your strength too see me through it   If it is Your will I'll do it   But how can I be king I'm just a kid?.We want the change   How we gonna get there?.I'm...

"The settings affect the cyclist in many ways on the way to Yosemite. Well for one when he took the shortcut, one thing that already made it difficult was that it was June, and he’s out in the desert. Also it says how he went to a couple towns that were deserted so there was no way to replenish his water. It says, “I pumped that handle for several minutes, but the water wouldn’t cool down. When I tried a drop or two, it had the flavor of battery acid.” @CAPS1 thing about his setting that changed was the hills.  But once he came to a bait shop, the old man asks  him if he  knows the best way to get to Yosemite, and he responds, “yes- sir: I own a very good map.” @CAPS2 by this he’s understood that the best way to travel anywhere is the path or road he knows because he’ll know what to expect. This is how the setting changed..Fight the war, fuck the norm   Why stand on a silent platform?.She comes home late with another screw loose   She swears to have had just a pineapple juice,   Falls asleep fully clothed in her bed   With her makeup remover by her head..(i'm not cheating)      Oooh, oooh   Everything is dinky doo   Everything you do   You, the king of la-di-da   Pretty very out far   Never oversits, he understands   Like the back of the hand   He should sing in a band, oh yeah      Oooh, oooh   People think he's loopey loo   And when they look at his shoes   He's a rocking sausage roll   He gets it in the goal   Healthy little 'brown affair'   And when he washes his hair   He'll get a round or a square   Get them singing      Oooh, oooh   Everyone from oxford town   Way down to the rio grande      Knows his harbour quays   His skin tight hands, without seggs   His name is legs      [talking]      Oooh, oooh   Coolies sweating in hong kong   Run along to the mardi grass      Risking asian flu to meet the man   Who lays the eggs   His name is legs      He's a cure for whooping cough   And if the going gets rough   Get lined up, come sikh, come czar   No matter who you are   We could get along and slide a rule   And if you don't play fools   While larry plays pool   You'll hear him singing      Oooh, oooh   [talking]   Oooh, oooh.Haushinka is a girl with a peculiar name.....There we go!....[Chorus x3].He comes for conversation   I comfort him sometimes   Comfort and consultation   He knows that's what he'll find   He knows that's what, he'll find"
"As the setting changes in the story, so does the cyclist’s narrator’s mood. His mood changes from happy and confident to indifferent and scared. At first the cyclist is so happy about Yosemite that he is just care free and no worries at all. He says that, “I rode into the morning with strong legs and a smile on my face.” Even at his first “ghost town” he just “chuckled, checked my water supply, and moved on”. After this point he could not be so care free. After this town he came to, “One ramshackle shed, several thirsty pumps, and men”. He said, “this was troubling”, it was very hot and he had been drinking his water pretty often. He said that, “He failed on."" He started to get sort of scared he realized that he could, ""drop from a heatstroke."" He was scared that because of his idea to believe the old men he might possibly die. He finally get happy when he reaches the bait shop and he got his drink. From then on the stock to his map. His attitude changed greatly throughout the story..(For sure)   Would you die for me?.Ghetto freak show....You're   Playing your story in fists ans starts..To spend one night with you   In our old rendezvous,   And reminisce with you..I hear my baby knockin', at my front door..No one aches,   No one hurts,   No one even sheds one tear   But, he cries,   He weeps,   He bleeds,   And he cares for your needs   And you just lay back,   And keep soaking it in      Oh, can't you see such sin?!.I don't care who you are baby   Don't care about all the friends that you know   And why you chose me   Lord, sweet mama don't want to know   Can't tie me down baby   Don't bring me down   Chains can't hold me, I gotta go      I don't want your money baby   Don't care for your fancy clothes   And how you people live together   I say lord in heaven only knows      Can't tie me down people   Don't bring me down   Oh the man can't stop me, I gotta go   Gonna hit that road   Buy me some coke      You can take all your charm baby   Yea sweet daddy knows where it goes   Yes it does   You can tell your big sister thanks a lot for the hole      Can't tie me down baby   Don't bring me down   Chains can't hold me, I gotta go   Gonna hit that road   I gotta go, don't hold me baby"
"The cyclist in “Rough Road @CAPS1; Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” starts off in the “serenity of an easly summer evening” taking road advice from old-timers. At first when the sun was beating down on him, he didn’t mind; the thoughts of Yosemite kept him determined. Later however, his determination was fading as he realized that his “short cut” was not so short after all. The “high deserts of California in June” and the terrain changed furthered his dehydration and need to find water. The emptiness of his surrounding with “no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind” made him focus on the horizon and tell himself that if he made it there, the he’d be alright. Finally, a building came into view. The hope he got from this gave him strength to move on. Ironically it was an abandoned building. The cyclist describes it as a “Welch’s Grape Juice factory and bottling plant.” @CAPS2 this he had lost hope and hung his head. Believing he was going to die, the cyclist got back on his bike. Driving away from the factory, he saw a sight of a fish camp and immediately regained hope. Going there, he regained his strength and learned his lesson, never take road advice from other people.  .Hey, come on, come on   Hey, come on, come on   Hey, come on, come on   Hey, come on, come on      Hey, come on, come on   Hey, come on, come on   Hey, come on, come on   Hey, come on, come on.Honey, if it's all the same to you   I'd love to stay right here at least till you walk by   Find an easier way of leavin'   There must be another way to say goodbye..We got more than a lifetime,   To live inside these lines,   We were right all along..Jesus walking on the water..My undead mummy and me..Rockin' around the Christmas tree at the Christmas party hop   Mistletoe hung where you can see every couple tries to stop      Rockin' around the Christmas tree let the Christmas spirit ring   Later we'll have some pumpkin pie and we'll do some caroling      You will get a sentimental feeling, when you hear voices singing   ""Let's be jolly, deck the halls with boughs of holly""      Rockin' around the Christmas tree, have a happy holiday   Everyone's dancing merrily in the new old-fashioned way, hey      You will get a sentimental feeling, when you hear voices singing   ""Let's be jolly, deck the halls with boughs of holly""      Rockin' around the Christmas tree at the Christmas party hop   Mistletoe hung where you can see every couple tries to stop      Rocking around the Christmas tree have a happy holiday   Everyone's dancing merrily in the new old-fashioned way   Rocking around the Christmas tree have a happy holiday.But miracles still happen,   And when my lucky star begins to shine,   With one luck break I'll make Linda      I'll make Linda mine!"
"In the story ""Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Limit,"" the features of the setting greatly affected the cyclist. As he was riding, he was passing through desert during June, a very hot month.There is not much water present in a desert (that would be part of the definition of a desert) and so, particularly in the even-hotter-than-normal June sun, he was at risk of running out of water. Had he been driving through, say, a forest or perhaps rolling grasslands, he might not have been in such danger, and could have merely looked for a river or dreck for water if he was desperate. Another thing that might have affected the cyclist would have been the affect of the desert on his mind. When people think of deserts they often think of dry, barren wastelands, complete with buzzards and maybe a dead cowskull, as in movies. Deserts are in intimidiating, they have a bad reputation and so, as he was riding through and was low on water thought of death how he was, ""going to die and the birds would pick (him) clean"" running through his now-teriffied head. Had he been in a city or in rolling farmland he might not have been as terrified. There are people in those places, and places to be safe there, but, in his desert, he had neither, allowing him to give way to despair. Setting does a lot to influence stories, so it is important to keep that in mind when reading. .I have spent nights with matches and knives,   Leaning over ledges, only two flights up..[Intro]   Wild, wild, wild, wild, wild   Wild, wild, wild, wild, wild   Mmm      [Verse 1]   You built me from a broken heart   With bricks you made from broken parts   You've fixed the paint, so we could start   So now what's mine is ours   I still have proof in form of scars   The first time always falls so far   Those healing wounds heal twice as hard   But now what's mine is ours   But now what's mine is ours      [Chorus]   We are survivors   We are survivors of the wild   We are survivors   We are survivors of the wild      [Verse 2]   My sweet devoted counterpart   We kept each other's shooting stars   However close, however far   Whatever's mine is ours   Whatever's mine is ours      [Chorus]   We are survivors   We are survivors of the wild   We are survivors   We are survivors of the wild   We are survivors   We are survivors of the wild   We are survivors (we are survivors)   We are survivors of the wild      [Bridge]   Woahoooo (we are, we are)   Woahoooo (we are, we are)   Woahoooo(we are, we are)   We are survivors of the wild   Woahoooo (we are, we are)   Woahoooo (we are, we are)   Woahoooo(we are, we are)   We are survivors of the wild      [Outro]   We are survivors of the wild   We are survivors (woah)   We are survivors of the wild   We are survivors (we are survivors)   We are survivors of the wild.Why oh why)   Well, here it is, the love you've been waitin' for   Why oh why)   Standin' in front of you like an open door      And then you ask yourself, is this where you belong?.I hope you won't forget me, 'cause we've shared a lot dreams..Ah ah   Baby girl was draped in Chanel   Said she love Tupac but hates some LL   Seen her at the bar with anklets and toe rings   She can take a prince, turn him into a king   I was looking at her in the limelight, pearly whites   Said her man get paper but he don't live right   All these emotions flowing inside the club   Do you really wanna thug or do ya want love?.Ohh, yeah!.When the actor reaches his death,   You know it's not for real."
"The features of the setting have a big impact on the cyclist. One feature is the hot weather and area he is in. He says he is in the “high desserts of California in June.” @CAPS1 being hot in @CAPS2, it has cyclist is around deserts, causing more heat. “I could drop from a heatstroke,” he says. Being hot from the sun beating down on him took away the cyclist’s energy he needs for riding his bike. Another feature that affected the cyclist was his lack of water. “Trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state.” This affected the cyclist by making him tired. Being tired from no water, the cyclist had trouble going up hills on his bike. The last feature that affected the cyclist was all of the hills in his road. “Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.” These hills made it hard to go up on a bike, considering his lack of water, and the heat. All of these features affect the cyclist by making him lose energy and get tired and frustarated because of their negative impact..So good-bye, fare thee well,   There's no time for delay,   You'll see me at the face-off, or catch the play-by-play   So good-bye, fare thee well,   I'm glad you shared my bed,   But never trust a fellow with a helmet on his head..But you're wrong..Yeah   When I'm steppin' out tonight, baby   I do believe, I'm really gonna knock 'em dead, oh!.Dreaming of that face again..I love you, earth, you are beautiful,   I love the way you shine..Try to convince you that you can't live without one   Hey look around man everybody's got one   So hurry up get your dollar bills together   They're going to try and get you something even better      You're not so sure but you heard it's great   You get there first so you won't be late   Everybody else will have to wait in line      I overestimated you   You knew that I probably would   We're so predictable   We've been sold a bill of goods      You want a choice want to make your own decisions   You want to make up the rules and the provisions      And everything is going to be so great   When you're the latest keeper at the gate   Everybody else will have to wait in line.Girl f you feel it then speak it   You would enjoy   This love is no secret   But if you want it to be   Then I keep it   As long as you don't keep it from me   Let the..."
"In the essay, “Rough Road ahead"" the character sees many settings through his ride, all of which affect his mood and physical condition. For example, when the author describes one place he came to as, “one ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps and a corral that couldn’t hold in the lamest mute greeted me. Thes sight was troubling”, this was the turning point where the cyclist began to worry. He was running out of water, “The sun was beginning to beat down”, and he was probably tired of pedaling. But, to make matters worse, he came to rolling hills. This affected him because he had to work harder and had less water to pick him up. When he finally got to a “modernized” town his spirits were lifted, and he was able to get water to cool him down. This gave him more strength and will-power to continue his trip Yosemite park..Tell me why   Tell me why      I can take an Aspirin   For a bad headache   But what pill for loneliness can I take?.I behold your power and glory   Bring an offering, Come before You   Worship You Lord   In the beauty of Your holiness      Whenever I call You're there   Redeemer and friend   Cherished beyond all words   This love never ends   Morning by morning, Your mercy awakens my soul   I lift up my eyes to see   The wonders of heaven Opening over me   Your goodness abounds   You've taken my breath away, with Your irresistible love.A kiss is a terrible thing to waste   A kiss is a terrible thing to waste   It's something that's always been so   A kiss is a terrible thing to waste   A kiss is a terrible thing to waste      And one of these nights   You're gonna show me that you already know   There's a feast waiting for you   And you've never even gotten a taste   It's later than you think and   A kiss is a terrible thing to waste!.I went to the doctor, I went to the mountains   I looked to the children, I drank from the fountain   There's more than one answer to these questions   Pointing me in crooked line   The less I seek my source for some definitive   The closer I am to fine..I'm back in the saddle again      I'm ridin', I'm loadin' up my pistol   I'm ridin', I really got a fistful   I'm ridin', I'm shinin' up my saddle   I'm ridin', this snake is gonna rattle      Yodalayhe yodalayhe yodayahehoo..If you say heaven, I say a castle of lies   You say forgive him, I say revenge   My sweet satan, you are the one.This business of burning human beings with napalm,   Filling our nation's homes with orphans and widows,   Of injecting poisonous drugs of hate into veins of peoples normally humane."
"After the cyclist spoke to the “old timers who hadn’t left the confines of their porches since Carter was in office,” his confidence in them began to ware. He entered the desert happy, hopeful and determined. As his water reservoir began to disappear, and he approached the sight of the old shed, canal and a couple water pump, he began to feel touched. He made an attempt to get the water from the pumps and it was hot and “tested like battery acid”. As he rode on, his confidence only faded more. He travelled through the desert and “ridiculously large snake” and was running low on water. Finally he saw a building in the distance, which ironically enlights was an abandoned juice factory a sign featuring a left sipping on some succulent icy liquid teased ruin, and he began to lose hope.

"One of the biggest problems that the author faced in his essay was his surroundings. The setting of the story in Yosemite provided many obstacles such as the vastness of the park, the summer heat, and the fact that many places had been abandoned. The summer heat was the biggest problem for the cyclist. He had to bike many miles, but he only had limited supply of water. Eventually, his water supply began to run low, which increased his determination to find the next town before he collapsed. It is this determination which moves him from ghost town to ghost town and keeps the story moving. Another big problem was the vastness of Yosemite National Park, which he was biking through. Any wrong turns (which he took, thanks to the direction he was given) could get him lost and thrown off track for a very long time. It was his confusion as to where the next time was that kept him biking, with difficulty and made for an interesting story. An example of the vastness of the park was when he quote, “About forty miles into the pedal, I arrived at the first ‘town.’ This place might have been a thriving spot at one time-say, before the last world war-but on that morning it fit the traditional definition of a ghost town.” This quote shows that even after many miles, he hadn’t seen a sign of anyone living, which would have increased his desperation to keep looking for civilization..There's something about the rain when it pours   It gets me thinkin' of you more and more   There's something about the way you are   That takes this empty feeling oh so far   Now I know can't deny what I am feeling   Can I hold you, can I have you a little longer   Can I know you, through my eyes let me tell you   I'm loving you more and more   There's something about the warmth of your touch   That came for a moment yet told me so much   I wish I didn't have to waste all that time   When I made believe that you are mine   Now I know can't deny that I am falling   Coz I love you, wanna have you by me forever (and ever)   Can I hold you, through my eyes let me tell you   (I'm lovin' you more)   If you knew what I've been going through   Would you feel the same way too   Tell me now what more can I do to get to   Know you and open up your heart   Show me where to start   Coz I'm loving you more and more   More and more...   Now I know can't deny that I am falling   (Coz I love you) You should know   I'm lovin' you so   Wanna have you by me forever (and ever)   Can I hold you, through my eyes let me tell you   I'm lovin' you more and more   (Can I know you) You should know   I'm lovin' you so   Wanna have you by me forever (and ever)   (Can I hold you) I wanna hold you   Through my eyes let me tell you   I'm loving you more and more....Just kiss on the trim, Jim..What a problem, you know he's fit to be tied   He tried to solve it, that was his only crime   Well, I ain't got no inhibitions   And my daddy gets left, alright   The time for him to make the decision   If this is still the place, I'm gonna spend the night   He says, ""get out, your no son of mine""   What a problem, you know he's fit to be tied   You don't understand, he thinks he's always right   He says, your lust is the toy of confliction   And you think you got fun all the time   In school, you ain't got no direction   He thinks I'm just a kid that ain't got no mind   I say, ""no way are you gonna run my life""   What a problem, you know he's fit to be tied   On my way, he pushed me over the line   What a problem, I'm only one of a kind   He says, ""get out, your no son of mine""   I say, ""no way are you gonna run my life""   Packed my bags, won't even say good-bye   I'll show you a thing or two, you know I've got my pride   What a problem, you know he's fit to be tied.Who wants to come with me and hide in the sky!.Let me vehind the wheel..I seen you walkin' every day on your way, school   I seen you talkin' to the children   I seen you talkin' to, ooh yeah   School teacher, yeah   In the boiler beneath the building   And I'm so lonely, I'm lonely, yeah   Go to your parties, goin' to your meeting   You look so busy, are you busy?.Its branches they're all twisted, its leaves are afraid of light."
"In the essay “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” the author uses features of the setting to show the effects of the cyclist. In the essay the rider gets directions from two old men on a perch. In the essay it said, “Never accept braid advice from  a collection of old- timers who haven’t let be able centres of their porch since carter was in office. “This shows the old man could be wrong and places can change. Also, on this short cut he almost runs out of water. The essay ststed I would conserve my water and go inward for an hour or se – a test of my inner spirit. He is running out of water but has the determination to get to @CAPS1 last the terrain affects him. The Hills prove to be a challenge with a limited supply of water. The essay states. Flat roads were upleed by sheed, rolling hills. This shows he is extremely determined. Even though the hills added to the struggle he made it through. That is how the author used features of the setting to add to the struggle of the cyclist..You're gonna remember the love, child,   That made you satisfied..Come on   I'm goin' down to New Orleans to see about a friend of mine   I'm goin' down to New Orleans and leavin' all of this behind   Headin' south from Detroit   I got Cajun cookin' on my mind   When I get to New Orleans someone gonna treat me right   Yeah in a town like New Orleans someone gonna treat me right   I'll be high 10 Rollin' till the early morning break daylight      A jambalaya and a crawfish pie gonna start my day   But when the sun goes down we gonna ""bon temps roulez""   Hey      I'm goin' down to New Orleans to see about a friend of mine   I'm goin' down to New Orleans where the stars on the sidewalk shine   Burnin' through Mississippi with the Big Easy on my mind      When I get to New Orleans someone gonna treat me right   Yeah in a town like New Orleans someone gonna treat me right   And I'm gonna party like the devil if the Neville brothers play tonight      Jambalaya and a crawfish pie gonna make my day   Down on the Bayou singing Hey Pocky Way      I'm goin' down to New Orleans to see about a friend of mine   Down in New Orleans good peoples they's hard to find   I bet he's making gumbo and drinkin' homemade wine   A jukebox shakin' and breakin' down in New Orleans   I'll be the highest hillbilly that Bourbon Street has ever seen   Oh yeah, yeah      I'm goin' down to New Orleans to see about a friend of mine   I'm goin' down to New Orleans and leavin' all of this behind   If the good Lord's willing and the rivers don't start to rise      And when I get to New Orleans someone's gonna treat me right   Said in a town like New Orleans someone gonna treat me right   All the cats in the cradle gonna rock this kid tonight   Oh hey      A jukebox shakin' and breakin' down in New Orleans   And if you're payin' for fun a french quarters really all you need.What are you doing?.And you know just what to   Do..But then you know me very well..Hey, hey, hey, the way that'chu want..And she says yes   With her kisses      And now he's ticklin' her fancy   Rubbin' her toes,   Muzzle to muzzle, now anything goes   As they wiggle   And Sue starts to giggle   And they whirled and they twirled and they tangoed   Singin' and jinglin' the jango   Floatin' like the heavens above   It looks like muskrat love"
"In the short story “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” by Joe Kurmaskie. the setting greatly affects the cyclist and his mindset. When the scenery is pretty and cheery, he is happy as well. This is shown when the author writes, “denyoved the serenity of an early- summer- evening.” This quote describes the scenery as a serre or peaceful place. His happiness is found in the first part of the quote when he said, “denyoyed” One does not enjoy something unless they are happy or in a cherry mindset. Therefore, the peaceful scery affected the cyclist by making him happy. the same can be said for merry scenery too. This is found when the author says, “At some point, tumble weeds crossed my path and the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke”. This quote, describes the scenery as a place that they tumbleweeds. Steryotypically, tumbleweeds are found in dreary and lonely place. This lonely scenery takes it if full on the cyclist. He becomes pessimist and is making of all that could go wrong, not all that could get better. This is found around us every day. The poor and homeless who live with a low standard of living are often said. They have to exist with the affected the cyclist. In conclusion, the seeing does affects the cyclist and his mindset drastically..We want the change   How we gonna get there?.Oh, you, you, you, the wind beneath my wings..Do you wish to be the one to understand?.We'd like to do one ... we'd like to do one from the album..(uh) I hit the club with a crew of niggas, (what it do nigga, what it do nigga) You wanna fight I wanna shot a nigga, (what it do nigga, what it do nigga) You disrespect me I'mma bruise a nigga (what it do nigga, what it do nigga) Think I'm a punk come and prove it nigga (what it do nigga, what it do nigga) fuck a hoe nigga, fuck a hoe nigga, fuck a hoe nigga, fuck a hoe nigga, fuck a bitch nigga, fuck a bitch nigga, fuck a bitch nigga, fuck a bitch nigga   E Rock-(uh uh) Fall in the club.Between yesterday and tomorrow   There is more there is more than a day..Wow!"
"In the story “Rough Road Ahead Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit"" the narrator is faced with the challenging and perilous desert he must cross. He wasnt traveling in a car, he was riding a bike and crossing a desert on foot is tiring enough let alone on a bike. ""The speed limit was @NUM1. I was doing a water depleting @NUM2. Sometimes life can be so cruel.” In the horrible @NUM3 degree heat the narrator gulps down his water bottles at such a rate that he’s at risk of running out. Not only that but he’s been pedaling for such a long time that he @MONTH1 pass out from exaustion or,.” I could drop from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June simply because I listened to some gentlemen who hadnt been off their porch in decades.” So I would say the narrator was pretty hasseled by his surroundings. .Grab your coat and get your hat   Leave your worry on the doorstep   Just direct your feet   To the sunny side of the street      Can't you hear a pitter-pat?.The best rapper alive (huh, yup)   The best rapper alive (huh, yup)   The best rapper alive (huh, yup)   The best rapper alive (huh)   Swagger right check, game tight   And you should, be afraid, be very afraid      The heart of New Orleans, thumpin' and beatin'   Livin' and breathin', steallin' and feedin'   Peelin' and leavin', killin' and greivin'   Dearly departed, erased deleted   No prints no plates, no face no trace   Out of sight out of mind, no court no case   Sell his chain, celebrate, block parties, second line,   Zulu ball bar, S.S. fest, jazz fest, Mardi Gras   Shotty bounce, body rock, now he dropped,   No he got, family try, tell the feds, tell the cops   Smell a rat, comin' back, to the house, to the spot   Tap tap, knock knock, who is that?.A pretty face may be some guys taste   But I'll take lovin' in its place,   'Cause I know beauty's only skin deep..There's a tugboat, huh, huh, down by the river dontcha know   Where a cement bag's just drooppin' on down   Oh, that cement is just, it's there for the weight, dear   Five'll get ya ten old Macky's back in town   Now d'ja hear 'bout Louie Miller?.Mona Lisa, Mona Lisa.Uncle Ernie:      I'm your wicked Uncle Ernie   I'm glad you won't see or hear me   As I fiddle about   Fiddle about   Fiddle about !.Bombs dropping down,   Please forgive, our hometown,   In our insignificance."
"Many of the features of the setting affect the cyclist. The cyclist is biking through deserts. “A rediculously large snake” this quote shows that only is weather and climate agasint him but also nature.” I could drop from heat stroke” another great quote showing how hot it really is where the cyclist is.” There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind.” A great detailed desciption of where the cyclist is and how deserted the area is.” The bottle only contained a few  tantilising sips.” This cyclist is low on water in the desert and in the desert with no water that could be a very bad thing. The above quotes really draw you in and you get to see the many features of the setting and what its like for the cyclist..I'm going out   And carrying on as normal      Hay una discoteca por acqui?.(""Man m-man m-man man I'm not playin', I kick the rough shit"")   (""Say what?"").Go on and tell me lies but hold, hold me tight..But I remember those snow-capped mountains   And a song on F.M..Meus mihi, suus cuique carus..Kaw-Liga,that poor old wooden head      Kaw-liga, Kaw-liga Kaw-Liga....The voices of the stars   Who played the Palace long before."
"It is said that, ""experience is a good substitute for @CAPS1 instinct.” This means if someone knows how to deal with the environment they're in they can survive even if they weren't born with the animal instinct that come with the territory. However, even the most experienced person can be overcome by the extreme weather conditions they live in. In the essay, ""Rough Road Ahead,” by Joe Kurmaskie, the experienced cyclist decides to take a long, difficult, and dangerous trip. His ride will take him a long the long desert paths of California with a limited water supply. This is the major element that and him in the story. Because he listened to same old men he went without water for most of his trip. Between his constant excersise, extreme heat, and lack of water, dehydration hit him fast. A common side effect of dehydration is hallucination, which the cyclist knew. It says in the essay, “I wiped the sweat from my eyes to make sure it wasn`t mirage.” This represents his knowledge and experience in the matter, and showed that he was adapt to his environment through experience. A similar story to this is jack @LOCATION2's, “To @CAPS2 a fire” where the man is also pitted against extremes at nature through the vukor, but the elements still ovetook him. Both stories represents man's quest for adventure, and also the canstrant struggle for survival that people face. .And I can see where you're goin', but I don't really know the way..Soft as smoke and as tough as nails   (Boxcar Jones, old walking man)..I've been up and down,both sides of the town..Let's runaway, just for the day,   Runaway, runaway..We followed a drunken man   He got us all spinning round   But it's like he swallowed himself   And didn't leave us a way out      I don't want to wake up   Lost in the Dreams of our Fathers   Oh, it's such a shame, child   To live and die for the Dreams of our Fathers   Though I must confess, yes   My view is a wonder about this   This love I possess, love   It must be the Dreams of our Fathers      This love I possess, love   It must be the Dreams of our Fathers   This love I possess, love   It must be the Dreams of our Fathers   This love I possess, love   It must be the love of our fathers      The dreams   The dreams   The dreams   This love I possess love.I want to be a scholar..peek-a-boo!"
"The lone biker in “Rough Road Ahead: Do not exceed posted speed limit” by @PERSON1 is strongly affected by the features of the landscape. The sun is the most important factor; it drives him to first consume his water quickly, and then drives him search for a water source.”The sun was beginning to beat down, but I barely noticed it...I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly,” in this quote, it reveals that even though the biker had not acknowledged the sun, his body had required water, depleting his supply in his water bottles. A lack of water feeling two hundred degrees...it had the flavor of battery acid."" The only water that the bike is able to find is not consumable. The most important of the factors, in the matter of survival, is the fish camp that the biker finally reaches. ”I stumbled into a rather modern bathroom and drank deeply from the sink.” The biker had been on the brink of dehydration and the fish camp is where he finally reganed the strength to continue on his journey..Well, baby used to stay out all night long   She made me cry, she done me wrong   She hurt my eyes open, that's no lie   Tables turn and now her turn to cry      [Chorus]   Because I used to love her, but it's all over now   Because I used to love her, but it's all over now      Well, she used to run around with every man in town   She spent all my money, playing her high class game   She put me out, it was a pity how I cried   Tables turn and now it's her turn to cry      [Chorus]      Well, I used to walk in the morning, get my breakfast in bed   When I'd gotten worried she'd ease my aching head   But now she's here and there, with every man in town   Still trying to take me for that same old clown      [Chorus: x2].This jealousy that tortures me is ecstasy, mystery, pain..The Johnny on the corner was a very sympathetic      I went to the place where every white face is an   Invitation to robbery   An' sitting here in my safe European home   I don't want to go back there again      Wasn't I lucky n' wouldn't it be loverly?.Never did what people said..Oh   Here I am   Feels like the walls are closing in   Once again it's time to face it and be strong   I wanna do the right thing now   I know it's up to me somehow   I've lost my way      If I could take it all back I would now   I never meant to let you all down   And now I've got to try to turn it all around   And figure out how to fix this   I know there's a way so I promise   I'm gonna clean up this mess I made   Maybe it's not to late   Maybe it's not to late, oh      So I'll take a stand   Even though it's complicated   If I can I wanna change the way I've made it   I've gotta do the right thing now   I know it's up to me somehow   I'll find my way      If I could take it all back I would now   I never meant to let you all down   And now I've got to try to turn it all around, yeah   And figure out how to fix this   I know there's a way so I promise   I'm gonna clean up the mess I made   Maybe it's not to late      I'm gonna find the strength   To be the one who that holds it all together   Show you that I'm sorry   But I know that we can make it better      If I could take it all back I would now   I never meant to let you all down   And now I've got to try to turn it all around   And figure out how to fix this   I know there's a way so I promise   I'm gonna clean up the mess I made   (Mess I made)   Maybe it's not to late      I never meant to let you all down   Now I've got to try (got to try) to turn it all around (all around)   And figure out how to fix this   I know there's a way so I promise (promise)   I'm gonna clean up this mess I made   Maybe it's not to late   Maybe it's not to late.Big Sky feels sad when he sees the children scream and cry,   But the Big Sky's too big to let it get him down..After the garden      After the garden is gone   After the garden is gone   After the garden is gone   After the garden is gone   After the garden is gone"
"In the author's recollection of his long and tiresome bike ride he talked about the struggles he had to face. when he set out that morning he asked some old guys on a porch for directions to @CAPS1. They told him that they knew the way and that they knew a shortcut. He choose to take their advice but later regreted it. when he found the towns that they spoke of all he found was ghost towns. ""Never accept travel advice from a collection of old-timers who haven't left the confines of their porches since carter was in office. ""He dose eventually reach a town were he finds signs of life. There he asks another old guy if he knows the way to Yosemite, the guy says he has a good map. All along his ride he was pleged by the sun and lack of watrer. The sun made him hot and thirsty which forced him to drink a lot of his water. when he rached his last few sips he resisted from drinking it and began loosing consciesness. ""I could drop from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June."".She still calls it her lucky night,   Yes someone was lucky she's right   But it was me..The difference is why   The difference is why   Does this have to mean goodbye?.y'all want me shot?!.Next time I'm in the studio I'll take my grudges out, and you can get the clean version sent to your house..Meth lab in the back and the crack smoke pills through the streets like an early morning fog   Momma's in the slaughter house with a hatchet helping daddy chop early morning hog   I'm catching Zs like an early morning saw when I woke up to the racket yawn and pause   What the fuck man I can never get sleep man, peeped out the window what's wrong with y'all?.When the twilight is gone and no songbirds are singing   When the twilight is gone you come into my heart   And here in my heart you will stay while I pray      My prayer is to linger with you   At the end of the day in a dream that's divine   My prayer is a rapture in blue   With the world far away and your lips close to mine      Tonight while our hearts are aglow   Oh tell me the words that I'm longing to know      My prayer and the answer you give   May they still be the same for as long as we live   That you'll always be there at the end of my prayer.Not enough to be a politician,   Wanted triumph, took my army on a mission."
"The features of the setting affect the cyclist because he thinks after a nice afternoon in a nice campground a shortcut to his next destination would be very nice. He thinks the shortcut will be a nice way to relax than to take the original longer way to Yosemite. But the trip he makes changes his mind a lot. In the essay the narrator is talking about what the old guys had told him. He says, “The old guys had sworn the next town only eighteen miles down the road. I could make that. I would conserve my water…” He did conserve his water but the town was very old and didn’t have any water for him to drink. So throughout the essay the narrator went without water until he got to a factory, got some water to drink, and got new directions. The trip was very different from what he had expected. It was more depressing..I've sailed the world for seven years,   And left all I love behind in tears..Johnny Thunder speaks for no one, goes on fighting..I've paid my dues to make it   Everybody wants me to be   What they want me to be   I'm not happy when I try to fake it!.Let 'em know it ain't easy   Are-E-S-P-E-C-T   Let's come togeta'   Sista's   (Yeah!).oh, I left my girlfriend at home I'm sorry..It can fill your cup with regret   Say a prayer, for all the souls in bloom...   Say a prayer...say a prayer....Ask the mirror on the wall   Who's the biggest fool of all,   Bet you feel small,   It happens to us all."
"In the adventures of the cyclist the setting is not only what developes the character but, that what affects how he pushes himself to not give up, even when he feels helpless. This is one example of how the cyclist is affected, ""I had been hitting my water bottles pretty reguarly and I was traveling through the high desert of California in June,"" With that information you can observe how this harsh setting creates problems for him physicaly because his body needs water. Which he is extremely limited and doesn't savor it very well. These issues create the problem of dehydration, and when mentally you think your going to die without water. You start to panic and lose control over yourself..But the world keeps it promise daily, to let me down,      But it can't hide what I have found..In olden days, a glimpse of stocking   Was looked on as something shocking..ha!.Baby you say you have a little song for me   But you're wearing shades and your eyes look real dark underneath   Baby I'm worried you'll get it wrong for me   There's four love songs so which one did you write for me?.I have seen too much   I haven't seen enough   You haven't seen it      I'll laugh until my head comes off   Women and children first   And children first   And children      Here I'm alive   Everything all of the time   Here I'm alive   Everything all of the time      Ice age coming   Ice age coming   Let me hear both sides   Let me hear both sides   Let me hear both      Ice age coming   Ice age coming   Throw it in the fire   Throw it in the fire   Throw it on the      We're not scaremongering   This is really happening   Happening   We're not scaremongering   This is really happening   Happening      Mobiles squerking   Mobiles chirping   Take the money run   Take the money run   Take the money      Here I'm alive   Everything all of the time   Here I'm alive   Everything all of the time      Here I'm alive   Everything all of the time   Here I'm alive   Everything all of the time      The first of the children [Repeat until fade].Say want some lady, whatcha gonna do?.Ask yourself: Can you even deliver   What she demands of you?"
"The features of the setting in the story “DO Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit”, affect the cyclist in the story, in many ways. The first of which would definetly be the lack of water the cyclist had, and the fact that there wasn’t anywhere around for miles. From the text it read “There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind.” This evidence from the text proves to the reader that the cyclist was getting worried. Another part of the setting would be the obvious element of temperature. The cyclist is our in the hot, relentless desert. “Wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June.” The author here, by using the elements of nature, is trying to make the reader concerned/scared for the main character. The final key had to travel and the road conditions. Although the desert is flat, he began to notice some hills in the road, and such a long distance, including the heat, could be deadly. The setting’s elements, greatly effect the cyclist in this story..Oh baby.mony, mony   So good!.Come on, girl, it'll be alright,   Easy does it nice and slow..Elo kiddies, elo kiddies   Hope you didn't get it on the television.Nobody's right till somebody's wrong..Let me tell you about these streets   (Always up to no good!).Grace: We got Annie."
"In ''Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted speed Limit'' by Joe Kurmaskie, the features of the setting most the time disappoint him. You can tell that the features of the setting disappointed him because every time he got to a town he couldn’t get water. In the text it states, ''I got down on my hands & knees working the handle of the rusty water pump a for like substance oozed out followed by @NUM1 degree brackish water that tasted like battery acid.’’ You know the setting disappoints him when he sees the terrain he has to cross as well. You can tell who he says ''At some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path a ridicuously large snake.'' The narrarator was disappointed that he listened to the directions of the elder rather than use his map. Joe Kurmaskie does a great job of making one narrarator faced & how he felt about them..What do I look like some kinda idiot?.Don't jump!"".""Be quiet..([...])   (Who?).It's knowing that feeling of coming home, to where   My spirit lies..How deep is the red??.But it's not like we had a choice at all."
"The setting in the essay ""Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit"" has a major effect on the cyclist. The setting is the high deserts of California"" where it is June and very hot. The path of the cyclist suggested by some old men makes the heat even worse because there are no people or water in sight. In the essay, the cyclist starts out the day confident and excited for his ride to Yosemite National Park. His mood changes throughout the day as after @NUM1 miles he arrives in a ""ghost town"" the old men led him to believe would be a settled town where he could get more supplies and cool off. Soon as the temperature rises to what feels like ""two hundred degrees"" the cyclist begins to run low on water and feels ""sometimes life can feel so cruel."" The heat and lack of people and water lead the cyclist to desperation and make him feel like as he says ""i was going todie."" The setting of the cyclists journey provides the mood of hopelessness and amplifies the feeling of determination felt by the cyclist to keep going at all costs because he was going to die if he stopped. The author, @PERSON1 uses the setting of the essay to help bring across his mesage that by blindly trustting people instead of trusting yourself things could end up being hard for you to overcome..       .""She does anything she wants, anytime she wants to,   With anyone..And the clouds will break   It should be near..Just a perfect day   Drink Sangria in the park   And then later   When it gets dark, we go home      Just a perfect day   Feed animals in the zoo   Then later   A movie, too, and then home      Oh, it's such a perfect day   I'm glad I spent it with you   Oh, such a perfect day   You just keep me hanging on   You just keep me hanging on      Just a perfect day   Problems all left alone   Weekenders on our own   It's such fun      Just a perfect day   You made me forget myself   I thought I was   Someone else, someone good      Oh, it's such a perfect day   I'm glad I spent it with you   Oh, such a perfect day   You just keep me hanging on   You just keep me hanging on      You're going to reap just what you sow   You're going to reap just what you sow   You're going to reap just what you sow   You're going to reap just what you sow.'Cause I'm so bored with myself   Anyway   Any time and any place   I'll just hang around      [Chorus]      One six two seven eight   Two six three seven eight nine      [Chorus]      Open up your eyes   Open up your room   Open up your arms   Open up your door   Open up your eyes   Open up your room.Silent night!.Will we shower you with flowers   Or will we shun ya   When your race is run?.Has God forgotten to be merciful?"
"The setting puts a great deal of stress on the cyclist. The biggest issue he faces is the weather. He is a cyclist “traveling through the high deserts of @LOCATION1 in June.” He had been riding his bike all day and he was soon going to run out of water. Just when he thought he could drink more water, he drank “water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees.” The weather being so hot and humid, did not help the cyclist throughout his journey. Another factor of the setting that affected the cyclist was the terrain. “Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills,” is a main problem the cyclist faced. These changes in terrain played into the fact that the weather did not cooperate. The hills made the cyclist work harder therefore use more energy. Luckily the terrain had a positive affect on the cyclist as well. The stones he found on the ground, helped keep his mind off the thirst. There were many factors of the setting that negatively and positively affected the cyclist throughout his adventure..Waiting for the time, to take away your life..And I don't borrow from the sunshine   'Cause the skies might turn to gray..Night and day I scan horizon, sea and sky,   My spirit wanders endlessly,   Until the day will dawn and friends from home discover why,   Hear me calling, rescue me,   Set me free, set me free,   Lost in this place and leave no trace..Baby, please don't go..Well as the night reared its light head   Into a baby's sun,   We rolled down into the town   From where the black throats come..Old records never die..He was a superstar, he was dynamite and whatever he did (it)   Seemed to be alright."
"Ghost towns are not exactly the most inviting place for a cyclis trunning low on water supply. In “Rough road ahead: do not exceed speed limit” the cyclist is affected in many ways by his surrounding settings. Starting off on a warm day with the sun bright start off as a good thing, while his mood is still fresh and happy expressions play on his face. But as he moves on he speaks of how “The sun was beginning to beat down” expressing his remorse of listening to the old men that led him on their “shortcut.” Along the road he comes to his first let-down, a ghost town with “one ramshackle shop, several rusty pumps and a corral that couldn’t hold the lamest male.” @CAPS1 he tries to pump the water from the corral but gets a “battery-acid” flavor and is forced to continue onward with little left to drink. This affects his mood to pity for himself and anger at the men who put him into the predicament. By the end he is relieved though when he comes to GARY & @CAPS2 FISH CAMP, a place with a working sink full of cold water. He says he “had an overwhelming urge to seek out @ORGANIZATION1, kiss them and buy some bait.” His thankfulness is expressed to men he doesn’t even know but because they were the light at the end of his long, dark and very exhausting tunnel..Because, well well, just because..Wait, now, what is the Raven?.Blind infatuations, the means to an end..Moscow's still red   The young man's dead   Gone to heaven instead   The evening news says he was confused   The motorways will all merge soon   Lottery winner buys the moon   They've come to save us   The space invaders are here      He thought of cars   And where, where to drive them   And who to drive them with   And there, there was no one, no one      There's panic at London Heathrow   Everybody wants to go up into the blue   But there's a ten year queue   Columbia is in top gear   It shouldn't snow at this time of year   Now America's shot gone   And done the lot      He thought of planes and where,   Where to fly to   And who to fly there with   And there, there was no one, no one.Botanical creature stirs, seeking revenge..Fantine   It pays a debt      Crone   Just think of that      Fantine   What can I do?.Licorice, black licorice."
"In the essay “Do not exceed posted speed limit” by Joe Kurmaskie, the features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. First, the sun is making the cyclist hot and dehydrated. He states “The sun was beginning to beat down,” @CAPS1, the sun was a big factor on the affect on the cyclist. Also, the hills of the country roads. Going up and down hills take alot of work you have to use alot of energy. The cyclist says “@CAPS2 were replaced by short, rolling hills.” @CAPS3, there were snakes in the road, which make the cyclist timid looking out for snakes so he would not get bit. Againg the cyclist states “dimond back-blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me.” @CAPS4, there was an old factory that gave the cyclist hope and then crushed his hopes. The factory even made him more thirsty. @CAPS1, there were many affects on the cyclist due to the setting..Is everything okay?.All my life, all my life   Where have you been, all my life?.If the day comes that you must leave   Let me be the ground to your feet   If the day comes that you feel weak   Let me be the armor you need   Oh, if you falling in love is a crime   And the price to pay is my life   Give me sword, bring all the knives   Hand me the gun, I will not run   And when they spare everything but my pride   Don't you worry, boy, don't you cry   But when they ask   Who was the one, who got you love   Let it be me      If you ever make your last breath   Let me be the last word you say   And if right comes, but you choose left   I will be the first to forgive   Oh if heaven is a beautiful place   But those gates have enough space   And they lock you out   Spare you no flame   I will come down   If they're on my wings   And when the angels call me a fool   For giving all grace up for you   I won't look back   But when they ask, who did you love   Let it be me      Let it be me   That you think of when everything tells you to give it up   Let it be me that will ankle your soul   Until the clouds fall out of the sky   And the snow fall out in July   Let it be me that you think of   Let it be the one that you love   Until the flowers don't blow in May   And forever until the days   Let it be me   Let it be me   The one that you love   Let it be me   Let it be me   Let it be me   Let it be me   Let it be me   Thank you for crediting me, dl   Only be me.I can't see the end of me   My whole expanse I cannot see   I formulate infinity   Stored deep inside me      If I had to lose a mile   If I had to touch feelings   I would lose my soul   The way I do      I don't have to think   I only have to do it   The results are always perfect   And that's old news      Would you like to hear my voice   Sprinkled with emotion   Invented at your birth?.In the city's melted furnace, unexpectedly we watched   With faces hidden while the walls were tightening   As the echo of the wedding bells before the blowin' rain   Dissolved into the bells of the lightning   Tolling for the rebel, tolling for the rake   Tolling for the luckless, the abandoned an' forsakened   Tolling for the outcast, burnin' constantly at stake   An' we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing..I ain't livin' here no more, I ain't even keepin' score   It's too late to change, it's over, I'm drownin' in a sea of tears   Nothin' I can say to you makes any difference   There ain't nothin' I can do, none of it's makin' sense      [Chorus]      Standing on the outside, I'm lookin' in at you, standing on the outside   Standing on the outside, I'm running out of time, standing on the outside      I'm so tired of bein' alone in a world that feels so cold   There's got to be a light that I can find   There's got to be a soul somewhere that shines for me      Now I don't want to live without love anymore, I just want to live my life   Love's gonna open up the door, show me it's light again      [Chorus]      Nothin' I can say to you makes any difference   There ain't nothin' I can do, none of it's makin' sense      Standing on the outside, I'm lookin' in at you, standing on the outside   Standing on the outside, what can I do, standing on the outside   Standing on the outside, I'm lookin' in at you   Standing on the outside, yes I'm lookin' in at you   Standing on the outside, I'm lookin' in at you.Good!"
"In the story many different settings affected the author in many different ways. In the very beginning of his journey he came across a ghost town. He reacted to the features of this setting with humor and hope. “I chuckled, checked my water supply, and moved on."" He still has hope that he would end up safe and in the right place. The next setting was an abandoned shed with a water pump and a fork in the rode. He grew worried when he saw that no near town was still in sight. “This sight was troubling” when the features of the next setting caught his eye he was desperate and devastated. “At some point, tumble weed crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake” He was on rough terrain in the middle of the desert with little water, when he reached the abandoned @CAPS1’s factory all his hope was lost and when he was planning his death. “I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean."" @CAPS2, when he reached the fish camp, he was relieved ""I had overwhelming urge to seek out Gary and Wilber, Kiss them and buy some bait.” He was overjoyed and overwhelmed because he had survived.    .I'm gonna risk it all like I've never lost   Gonna give it all I've got   I will love you,   I will love like I've never been hurt, never been hurt      You set fire to ashes   You fought through the darkness and brought me back to life, you brought me back to life      So even if I lose it all   I got so much left to give, I won't give up, no, no   My heart's on the front-line, I'm not afraid      I will love you,   Like I've never been hurt   Run through fire for you,   Like I've never been burned   I'm gonna risk it all like I've never lost   Gonna give it all I've got   I will love you,   I will love like I've never been hurt, never been hurt      I will love you and forever   I will love you like I never   Like I never heard goodbye   Like I never heard a lie   Like I'm falling into love for the first time   Yeah      I will love you,   Like I've never been hurt   Run through fire for you,   Like I've never been burned   I'm gonna risk it all like I've never lost   Gonna give it all I've got   I will love you,   I will love like I've never been hurt, never been hurt.It's lovely going through   The zoo!.You swallowed my face   When you kissed me today   It was sweet but okay   That's a little much   And when we walk down the street   You'll be right under me   I can't move two feet without your touch      Ungreatful, oh no I am not   Most women would kill to have what I got (I know)   All I'm saying is that sometimes baby   There's nothing wrong with giving me a little room to breathe      Baby I just need a little space   A little break   From you today   Now I don't want you to go away   But just for today   Go over there (could you go over there x2)      When I'm getting ready   To go out with my peeps   You be looking at me   Like can I come too   Baby where are your friends   Aren't they off watching   Football or something   And waiting for you      Ungreatful, oh no I am not   Most women would kill to have what I got (I know)   All I'm saying is that sometimes baby   There's nothing wrong with giving me a little room to breathe      Baby I just need a little space   A little break   From you today   Now I don't want you to go away   But just for today   Go over there (could you go over there x2)      Just back up off of me   I'm not tryna be mean   But could you give me fifty feet   Only for a little while   I know you love to be by my side   And that's fine   But every once in a while   Take your space and give me mine      Baby I just need a little space   A little break   From you today   Now I don't want you to go away   But just for today   Go over there.I've got sunshine on a cloudy day   When it's cold outside I've got the month of May   I guess you'd say   What can make me feel this way?.The road he treads is difficult and stony   He rides fer days on end with just a pony for a friend      I sure am feeling sorry for the pony!.You use me to get you anything you wanted..I'd ask you to marry me - give you the sun for a diamond ring."
"The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways.For example, ""I noticed the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills."" This quote shows that his surroundings were giving him diffuculty and a challenge for his travel. By describing the hills as ""rolling"" it helps the reader imagine the obstacles he was going through. Also, the sign that read, ""Rough Road Ahead; Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit."" gives the reader a feeling that the character is in danger. Lastly an example of the setting that helps shows the charcters hardships is, ""no one in sight, not a building, car or structure of any hand."" If anything were to the happen to the character, as the author was foreshadowing, he'd be stranded and all alone to die. He'd be in trouble and there would be no one to help him. If the author did not use these examples, the reader would not easily get a picture of the troubles he had to overcome. In conclusion these examples added emphasise and meaning to the text.   .Give me a ticket on a jet airplane   I'm a-gonna take it   I live my life in the fast lane, the only way to make it   And I keep on going all night long   Cause that's the way I like it   And with what you got in the heat of the night   I know we got to try it      Until the flame burns out   Until the flame burns out      So turn it up, your radio,   Everybody shake it   I'm a hundred degrees, with wild fantasies   And I need someone to make it   Show me a place where love is sweet   I ain't gonna fake it   And hey little girl if you want my love   Then now's the time to take it      Before the flame burns out [Repeat: x4]      Turn up the flame your hips are fire   You're so hot I got to try ya   Show me the spot and I'll hit the mark   Baby I got the gasoline and you got the sparks      Before the flame burns out   Before the flame burns out   Until the flame burns out   Until the flame burns out.She had some Choc-Wheaton's   Some plastic tupperware..You can't run   You can't hide   On the wings of a dove   Or behind your vicious pride (you better come through it)      Hey   You gotta silver tongue   You use it and you use it   And you'll get us all hung   You know you should, should, shoulda known better   Than take a chance   'Cause if you can't feel the rhythm   If you can't feel the rhythm don't dance!.I hear you say   I'll meet you at the Blue Cafe      So meet me at the Blue Cafe.Till you know my hidden shame you really don't know me      Well, there's a different kind of prison   And it don't even have to look much like a cell   It's already on your mind, boy, we can see it in your eyes   So, here's the bars and walls as well      Well, you know I'm never coming home, babe   You said you'd stand by me until I cleared my name   Sure it's easy to be strong   When you know the charge is wrong   But the days and weeks get long   When you've got a hidden shame      Hidden shame, shame, shame that I can't get free   From the blame and the torture and the misery   Must it be my secret for eternity?.So come on girls, we've got to get together   You know we can't give up....Mmmmm, I am alive baby."
"The setting affected the cyclist because the terrain you ride on can determine how you ride. For instance when you have hills and dry weather like they did when it said “flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills” The one easy terrain was now made more difficult and only added to his frustration and his dehydration from having no water. Also the heat contributed plenty and it was there the whole time.  Sometimes he didn’t seem to notice or feel it but it was there and it was taking energy from him: Like when it said, “The sun was beginning to beat down, but I barely noticed it.” He didn’t know it but that took from him so he drank more water and that affected his ability to take enough to complete the ride..Traveled the world in million ways   Catching the palm in familiar gaze   Everyone lives by two hard eyes   There's no one with time to laugh or cry   There's no one to tell us what we're living for      And though I tried to be a good man   I just know that I'll be losing very soon   And there are times and there are motions   When I do believe I'm going out of tune, oh      I've been around a long, long while   Looking for sun to make me smile   But still multiply their daily bread   They're thinking their lives put times ahead   It must be a mighty funny way to feel      And though I tried to be a good man   I keep finding out there's nowhere to begin   And so I think I'll go on singing   And in time I hope that we can all join in, oh.Can't spend my life in your sheets of silk   I've got to find my way   Crawl out and greet the day..I'm getting tired of so much gray..on the sidewalk with the misery on his brain   Stoned on some new potion he found upon the wall   Of some unholy bathroom in some ungodly hall   He only had a dollar to live on ?till next Monday   But he spent it all on comfort for his mind   Did you say you think he's blind?.Let me tell you how it will be   There's one for you, nineteen for me   'Cause I'm the taxman, yeah, I'm the taxman      Should five per cent appear too small   Be thankful I don't take it all   'Cause I'm the taxman, yeah I'm the taxman      If you drive a car, I'll tax the street,   If you try to sit, I'll tax your seat..When we meet again   And introduced as friends   Please don't let on   That you knew me when   I was hungry and it was your world..Are you passionate?"
"The narrator in this story goes through a tough journey insisting of hope, challenge physical pain, despair, and relief. All of these are further developed by the settings where they take place, For example after taking advice from old men at a campsite, he is on his way through the deserts of California. If he had been almost anywhere else, his journey could have been much better. He could have gotten more reliable advice, or had been in a place where the towns were not miles and miles apart. Also, at one point he reaches a snake on the road. This could symbolize a decision, which was to go and how it will affect the outcome of his trip, or perhaps the decisions he had already made. To take advice from strangers and better yet he should use it. The irony continues as he becomes dehydrated and the flat land turns hilly. If that weren’t to happen he could have been more successful and healthy on his trip. The setting in this men’s story are necessary for if to have plot line and have the humour it possesses. If he were in the city, for example, he would not get lost and stranded, and therefore would have no story..shit   I be on til infinity   Don't predict, bitch, what I'm gonna do   Cause chances are I've outdone you   And most of my so called enemies   Spit your game, talk your shit   Grab your gat, call your clique   Ball so hard I don't need the assist   I'm the best so I keep that shit   Nigga, you should too   If you knew what this game'll do to you   Look at bullshit that I've been through   This the drive through and shit on you      [Hook: Tyga]   Don't get it fucked up   Yesterday was the freshest nigga in America   I swear to God I ain't lyin', bruh, I ain't lyin' bruh   In America   Don't get it fucked up   Niggas talkin' bout oh shit   I pull up like oh shit   Now look whose talkin', bitch   Now look whose talkin', bitch, yeah   Don't get it fucked up   I do this shit for my, I do this shit for my   Do this shit for my loved ones   Don't get it fucked up   I do this shit for my, I do this shit for my   I don't trust niggas, I only trust funds nigga      [Verse 2: Chris Brown]   Nowadays everybody wanna talk like they got somethin' to say   But nothin' comes out when they move they lips   This extended clip will make Buddha shit   Shawty comin' and pullin' up with them hooter tips   Never use a nigga, but she abuse the dick   I let the pussy let the air drop   We in a boat, nigga, right off the coast   European or Caribbean, I'm sweatin' on hair dye   So don't get it fucked up   I got a handful of matches, fuckin' with a bad bitch   All my niggas is savages, better loc up   Damn ,it's a tragedy, all of these casualties   Metal through his body, nigga, check his anatomy, oh shit   Why you pillow talkin'?.(retro, retro, dance)   Singing retro dance beats   Retro dance, freak!.I love my Valleri..Hearts break too fast when they're sentimental   Won't stay won't last when it's love at first sight   So why are my convictions blinded by your spotlight      Can't breathe can't sleep with some medication   I'll kiss goodbye to my reservations   I know there's other fish out in the sea   Not for me   I want you      [Chorus]   If I can't have you then I don't want anyone (I don't want anyone)   If I can't have you then all the damage has been done baby   You can break these rules if you wanna have some fun (if you wanna have some fun)   Think of all the love that you will lose if I can't have you      Heartbeat cold sweat thoughts slipping under   Can't fight no threat 'cause there's just no use   One look, no hesitation   I'm slipping into you      Forgive these eyes these lips you're tasting   No time to waste on an invitation   My shame my self control has suffered enough   Everybody wants to be loved      [Chorus]      I haven't seen the best that love has had to offer   They say perfection's always right around the corner   Could be true   But if I can't have you      [Chorus].Can you just give me a second please?.I walked up the steps and I peeked in the door   But the devil said, ""don't you go in!"".Empty your sadness like you're dumping your purse on my bedroom floor,   We put your curse in reverse."
"The features of the setting affect the cyclist’s mood towards the journey. At first, he is confident that the old men’s knowledge of the land is accurate and he is excited about what lies ahead for him. However, his excitement soon turned into dismay and slight doubt as his journey drags on. The heat of the weather and lack of water makes the cyclist develop an uncaring matter. “I’d read once that sucking on stones helps…with any luck I’d hit a bump and lodge one in my throat.” The verbal irony in this passage delivers a negative feeling to the reader and it is here that it is clear that the cyclist doesn’t care what happens to him. When he finally reaches a sign of civilization, the cyclist becomes himself again and decides that his knowledge is best..He wasn't famous but I sure did love him   I've got his picture in a little frame   He lost his life to a big disease before it even had a name   But there's so many more and I've lost count   The how's and whys aren't important now   All that matters is they came around   And brightened up our lives      She was twenty one with her life ahead   You don't need to know her name   She breathed her last on the cold stone floor of a Hollywood arcade   But fate's right hand isn't always just   Puts a lot of pressure on your faith and trust   She was just a little girl ain't that enough   To rage against the day      [Chorus:]   And how did we get so lucky?.They call your daddy Big Boots   And Big Boots is his name   It takes a big man to wear big boots   That's your daddy's claim to fame   They know your daddy Big Boots   Wherever soldiers are   'Cause he can handle an armored tank   Just like a kiddy can   So sleep little soldier   Don't you cry   Loo loo loo loo   Loo loo loo   General sandman's soon coming by   Loo loo loo loo   Loo loo loo   I'm gonna tell you a little secret   You won't believe it's true   Did you know your   Daddy Big Boots   Once wore little boots like you.Or just a little cheaper than spit?.What is it with you?.To see I get safely to   The port where my heart   Is too lost to find..If you can hang, you can trip on it   You surely won't fall (Put your love down)   No side effects and   The feeling last 4-ever   Straight up - it tastes good   It makes you feel clever (Put your love down)   You kiss your enemies   Like you know you should   Then you jerk your body   Like a horny pony would (Put your love down)   You jerk your body like a horny pony would   Now run and tell your mama about that!.[Verse 1]   What happened here   As the New York sunset disappeared   I found an empty garden among the flagstones there   Who lived here   He must have been a gardener that cared a lot   Who weeded out the tears and grew a good crop   And now it all looks strange   It's funny how one insect can damage so much grain      [Verse 2]   And what's it for   This little empty garden by the brownstone door   And in the cracks along the sidewalk nothing grows no more   Who lived here   He must have been a gardener that cared a lot   Who weeded out the tears and grew a good crop   And we are so amazed we're crippled and we're dazed   A gardener like that one, no-one can replace      [Chorus]   And I've been knocking but no one answers   And I've been knocking most all the day   Oh and I've been calling, oh hey hey Johnny   Can't you come out to play?"
"The feature of the setting including the conditions, weather, and amount of water can possibly decide the life or death of the cyclist. The conditions such as hills, and rocky roads can decied a future for a cyclist because if the rocky roads turn you off balance you could fall down a hill and give yourself an injury or possibly die. For example, in the short-story it says, “over one long crippling hill, a building came into view” This shows the conditions in which the cyclist had to deal with. In addition, the weather and amount os water can also decide the future. “The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips. Wide rings of sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke.” This shows us that if the cyclist gets dehydrated enough he could pass out and no one would find him in the desert. In addition, the heat isn’t helping him out any once he could die without anyone knowing. These reasons show us a cyclist needs to make sure they have enough water and the conditons and weather is right so they don’t make a life-threating choice..Fall beneath Your will..My ashes within your hands..Can it pull you through?.He said the name Bojangles and he danced a lick   Across the cell..Unh, come on   I don't walk, I stalk, livin' foul like pork   Shuttin' down underground streets of New York   Hawk is what them niggas call me, 'cause they all be   Suckin' my dick and on my mother fucking balls, G   I know the half, so I laugh wit' 'em   Blood bath went I let the fuckin' rap hit 'em   Full clip, but only half did 'em   That's all it took, another crook   Taken out over a dirty look   I bag game with niggas I leave shot dead   You're only taken a piss from me with hot led   You know my style faggot, 'cause I'm always schemin'   In jail, niggas holdin' a sink screamin'   Police, but you got no peace   Yo, was that you big man, and alot mo' grease   All I gets is pounds, you ain't want none of this   Back streets are like track meets 'cause I be runnin' this      Ain't nowhere to run ('cause I be runnin' this)   Ain't nowhere to hide (come on)   Ain't nowhere to go ('cause I be runnin' this)   Reaper saved your soul (come on)      Surroned by the colors, I see crimson, black and blue (come on)   Locking open doors again, I'm still afraid of you   (straight up, mother fucker)   Light to dark, then light again, I always thought I knew (come on)   Young to old and young again, what's left for me to do?.Oh demon alcohol,   Sad memories I cannot recall,   Who thought I would say,   Damn it all and blow it all,   Oh demon alcohol,   Memories I cannot recall,   Who thought I would fall a slave to demon alcohol..And so my love   From my window I can see   A beautiful vision   And when the music plays   Your body rises like a bird of grace      [Chorus]   Mi morena   I saw you dancing in the rain   Holy water   Shining like a silver flame   Come like a ghost   I will watch you dance alone   Mi morena   You're the light within my soul      And so my love   The way you're moving in your dress   To a nylon guitar   On wings of silk and lace   You lift upon the notes and slip away      [Chorus]      Take this cross of feathers and bone   Take this heart I've carved into stone   In your name      Where the setting sun surrenders to the moon   Mi querida   I will wait for you      [Chorus]      Mi morena   Hold your hands out to the light   Be my lover   I will fall into your eyes   Sweet fire of love   For you I'd steal the stars   'Cause I adore you   O my morena"
"Author Joe Kurmaskie learns the dangers of a lifeless wilderness during his experience described in “do not exceed posted speed limit.” As a cyclist riding in one of the most undeveloped areas in California, the lack of water found in this setting proves crippling to his survival. The trails he was directed to had no towns or sources of fresh, drinkable water for days. The combination of constant exercise riding through the terrain, lack of water and recources, California summer weather and lack of civilization trained the author’s energy and caused him to suffer from dehydration. Too much exposer to these conditions could have killed him. The modern time period and year also caused the directions the author were given to be in accurate, and, thus, causing the cyclist to find him self in such a dangerous area of the country. The setting of “do not exceed posted speed limit” places the cyclist in a life threatening situation..I'm trying to tap into some wisdom,   Even a little drop willdo....Ouh, il me fait peur   Quand ils chuchotent entre eux..I'm not comin' down..Just a sad story..Pornography at novotel,   The redneck show on cnn   And the picture on the wall   Clubland   Clubland   Clubland never meant that much to me   Clubland   Clubland   Clubland never held that much for me   All the little draculas   The suckers and the vacuous   The throbbing of the temples now   And the prices at the bar   Did God send you to kill my joy?.Well it hurt enough   When you told me you were leaving   Did you have to go   And break this heart in two   By writing me a letter   I must have read a thousand times   Saying you'll be back   When I'm ready to spend   My life with you      And I'm not ready to settle down   But for you, maybe I would   But for you, maybe I could   So I find myself alone   By the beach where many nights we stood   And I think about this life   I really do live   But it's hard to change   A man like me   Who knows what he wants   And he knows what he sees         And someone like you   Will take all the love I've got to give   And I'm not ready to settle down   But for you maybe I would   But for you maybe I could         So a part of me says, boy   You're talkin' like a fool   When you've given all you've got   To give what they have   And it's hard to change   A man like me   Who knows what he wants   And he knows what he sees         But a love like this   May never come again I know   And I'm not ready to settle down   But for you maybe I would   But for you maybe I could   For you maybe, maybe, maybe I would   Maybe, maybe for you   Maybe I would   Maybe I could"
"The features of the setting in “DO NOT EXCEED POSTED SPEED LIMIT” affect the cyclist in a negative way. The terrain goes from being very mild to rough and rolling. Considering that the author does not know the layout of this terrain very well, he begins to struggle. The author is very unsure of where to go and begins encountering obstacles such as, tumbleweed, snakes and lack of water. The fact that the author is running out of water, makes continuing on a very stressful. He is worried that he will die of dehydration before he ever reaches Yosemite National Park. Finally, with much strength and determination, he reaches a fish a Fish camp. He is able to fill his water supply and regain his strength before pressing on..Sa May istasyon ihahatid ka   Tinititigan bagahe mong dala   Minamasdan kita,   Mamaya'y wala ka na      Sa may istasyon kasama kita   Pinipigil luha sa 'king mata   Ngayo'y kapiling ka,   Mamaya'y nag-iisa na      Hanggang sa muli,   Iiwasang sa isip ka lagi   Di hahanapin o kakailanganin   Di sasabihing mahal ka sa akin   Hangang sa muli   Pipiliting huwag kang alalahanin   Di nanaisin yakap mo't halik   Di sasabihing sana'y magbalik   Hangang sa muli      Sa may istasyon ika'y sasakay na   Papalayo na'y sinusundan pa   Ika'y wala na ako'y nakatingin pa   Hangang sa muli.(Up the river)   (Up the river)   (Up the river)      (Up the river)   (Up the river)   (Up the river)      (Up the river)   (Up the river)   (Up the river).I saw a hundred men laughing only two understanding   A wheel that was spinning for good and for evil   There was a church bell ringing but nobody listening   Except the beggars in the doorways of designer perfection   There was a thin man collecting for a government problem   He spent a long time waiting with that look of disapproval   There was icicles forming in the agency windows but nothing for sale there   Only dreamtime oblivion   Ah - the mysteries that are discussed in the beds of the kings and queens   Ah - The mysery well it brings you down like a recurring dream   Ah - here on the diamond avenue (on the diamond avenue)   And there's a tightrop marriage between the doctor and the junkie   In daylight it's perfect but at night time it's frightening   The hospital was moved so the hotel could profit   But nobody stayed up there to curse it or to mock it   As hi-fi condition arranged for my transport   But there's nothing to hear except the sound of bloody progress   The buildings are blushing from the interest they're earning   But the tables and the chairs on the bombsites are burning   Ah - the mysteries that are discussed in the beds of the kings and queens   Ah - The mysery well it brings you down like a recurring dream   Ah - here on the diamond avenue (on the diamond avenue)   Let's have a look, what do you see   I saw Thatcher and Murdoch those twins of confusing   Pay Saatchi and Saatchi to keep up their little illusion   I saw pepsi and my hero both digging a goldmine   It's funny how money can make you deaf as well as blind   Ah - the mysteries that are discussed in the beds of the kings and queens   Ah..[Verse:]   There's a lightning in your eyes, I can't deny   Then there's me inside a sinking boat, running out of time   Without you I'll never make it out alive   But I know, yes I know we'll be alright   There's a devil in your smile it's chasing me   And every time I turn around it's only gaining speed   There's a moment when you finally realize   There's no way you can change the rolling tide   But I know, yes I know that I'll be fine      [Chorus:]   This time I'm ready to run   Escape from the city and follow the sun   Cause I wanna be yours, don't you wanna be mine?.I dreamt we were standing   By the banks of the Thames   Where the cold grey waters ripple   In the misty morning light   Held a match to your cigarette   Watched the smoke curl in the mist   Your eyes, blue as the ocean between us   Smiling at me      I awoke alone and lonely   In a faraway place   The sun fell cold upon my face   The cracks in the ceiling spelt hell   Turned to the wall   Pulled the sheets around my head   Tried to sleep, and dream my way   Back to you again      Count the days   Slowly passing by   Step on a plane   And fly away   I'll see you then   As the dawn birds sing   On a cold and misty morning   By the Albert Bridge.You can always take the time      To let somebody know that you really care   Let somebody see what you have to share   Oh yeah   It's a simple thing   To let somebody know      Always in a rush, don't you see the sign?.I remember one girl   Who'd believe she'd be so devious   Bad decision, bad move   She told the papers everything   Well maybe   Do you need it, do you?"
"The features of the setting in Yosemite give the cyclist something in look forward to, but the feature of the sorting that he is in enduse in get there causes him despaire. As soon as the cyclist passes a ghost town and notices swettering hed of the sun during early endeavers of the trip he checks himself up as he says,""I brely noticed it [the sun], the cool pines and rushing hills of Yosemite had my name written all over them. Although the cyclist began to feel the toll that the trip and the sun was going to take on him, he erased the morning with the hope and bealy of arriving at Yosemite. The more the cyclist noticedthe sun the more he drank untill his water supply seemed low, striping as an old rusty water pump he had hope of being replenished but the taste of bitter battery acid caused the cyclist to stop drinking. The rolling hills, Sun and tumbleweds did nothing to quech the cyclist thirst or at least divert his assertion. If the cyclists was to see a sign that said Yosemite @NUM1 miles away his spirits would have risen, instead he saw a sign that said, ”Rough Road Ahead” which did nothing to help him. If the terrain was more poporsed, easier to travel on and in plenty supply of water, the tune of this passive would be more hoped instead in such despair, the features of the setting caused the cyclist grief instead of hope..Well, if you get the cards   Then you should bet the cards   At least, that's what I've always heard      You have your hunch, I'll have mine   Suppose we both we both just string along   Until we prove our intuition can be wrong..It's a measure of people who don't understand,   The pleasures of life in a hillbilly band..I don't want tears from you   Don't build your love on shame   All what we've done is through   And all we can do remains   My lady can't you see   I love not jealously   But for all you are to me   And all you'll be tomorrow.Now they've thrown out all the undesired,   Morbid dreams behind a gay attire..This game you play I like in a way..It's late in the evening   Glass on the side now   I've been sat with you   For most of the night   Ignoring everybody here   We wish they would disappear   So maybe we could get down now   And I don't wanna know   If you're getting ahead of the program   I want you to be mine, lady   To hold your body close   Take another step into the no-man's land   For the longest time lady      I need you darling   Come on set the tone   If you feel you're falling   Won't you let me know   If you love me come on get involved   Feeling rushing through you from your head to toe      Sing!.[Verse 2]   A birth and a death on the same day,   And honey I only appear so I can fade away."
"The features the cyclist experianced during his ride affect his body and mind. At first the cyclist was on flat graund, drinking plenty of water and without fear. But when he came to his second town, he became ton on water. This troubled him, but he was optomistic telling himself “the next town was only eighteen miles.” After this the road was replaced by short, rolling hills.” this started to trouble him. Dehydration started to set him and every hill was a challenge. Once out of water he sucked on pebbles and hopped it would “take your mind off of thirst.” When he finally made it, he was so relieved. Everything from dehydration, wich affects the body to lozing hope affected the cyclist on his ride.Keep them other girls at bay,   Oh, I would blow them all away..Was it in Tahiti,were we on the Nile   Long long ago say an hour ago   I recall that I saw your smile   I remember you-ooh   You're the one who made my dreams come true   A few kisses ago      I remember you-ooh   You're the one who said ""I love you, too""   Yes, I do, didn't ya know?.Dres, gonna put em on the hoe stroll!.A still small voice will speak to you one day..Cold beer and a strange cigarette   Getting you high getting you wet   Falling in love falling out of debt   Straight gay black or white   Strutting in the dark hiding in the light   Doing it wrong doing it right just doing it   You got your life on the one hand   Mine in the other   I got the right we all got the right      One man's meat is the other man's lousy luck   One man's meat is someone's empty well   One man's meat is some guy's aching butt   One man's meat is another man's living hell      Short fat thick or thin   Take it in the gut take it on the chin   Living in glory living in sin   Hard day's work going down slow   Riding the road where the green grass grows   Watching in die what d'you know   Watch it   You got your life on the one hand   Mine in the other   I got the right      One man's meat is the other man's lousy luck   One man's meat is someone's empty well   One man's meat is some guy's aching butt   One man's meat is another man's living hell.I can't reach out and touch you   You're hung up on the line   I'm your disconnected number now   And you're a private line..And like this Ugh!"
"The features of the setting affect the cyclist because they change the cyclist’s mood towards the rider. For example, in the essay “Rough Road Ahead;Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” it states, ""There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or sructure of any kind. I began breaking the ride clan into distances I could see on the horizon” The cyclist had to do this because they were having trouble riding since they were thirsty and the ride was very boring. This makes the ride seem larges so it also makes it harder to ride. Also in the essay it states, ""One ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps” This affeted the cyclist because after seeing this and later realizing he could’t drink the water, he was more thirsty since he was running out of water. When the cyclist notices the Welch‘s grape juice factory, he bacames determined to get there. In conclusion, the cyclist in the essay “Rough Road Ahead"" by Joe Kurmaskie, the cyclist mood towards the ride is strongly affected by the setting’s features..Tell me, tell me yeah   Don't tease me..Old man take a look at my life I'm a lot like you   I need someone to love me the whole day through   Ah, one look in my eyes and you can tell that's true..Easy rider don't you deny my name,   Oh no, oh no..Because I know she'll always be the only girl for me..Et itur ad astra..How much time did you spend?.E-you-P-H-O-are-I-A   That's the new word for today   E-you-P-H-O-are-I-A   It's very easy to say   Say Euphoria and you'll feel fine from the start   You can close your eyes   And see the world with your heart      Do what you wish, be what you are   What a victorious thrill   Wearing a smile, all of the while   Feeling the world standing still   Watch rainbows glow rest on a bed of flowers   Then dial a star   Anything's in your powers      Euphoria   Full euphoria   Knowing no ills, needing no pills   Singing a rock and roll hymn   Feeling glorious, full of love   Fine from the start   You can close your eyes   And see the world with your heart      How good to be happy and free   Living the way that you choose   Healthily and clean   Can't understand anyone having the blues   Euphoria never to feel frustration   How great to give euphoria invitation   Euphoria, euphoria   Long as we love each other"
"In “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit”, the author faces many obstacles because of the different terrain changes on his journey to Yosemite National Park. Taking advice from a group of old men, he headed to his first stop. The old men said he would see a town but what he really saw was a sort of ruined ""ghost"" town. Then he came to a fork in the road and was running out of water. He had been riding on flat road when the terrain dramatically changed. It became hilly and very inconsistent. This sudden change in terrain caused him to get more tired, thirsty, and hot. The cyclist then came to a huge hill and, using his last bit of energy, rode down. He was exhausted. All the terrain changes not only changed the cyclist’s physical state, but his mood and determination as well.  .I know you've heard it's over now and war must surely come,   The cities they are broke in half and the middle men are gone..You have one letter left to send   With no beginning and no end   You saw them in the park   The laughter in the dark, oh no   How can you face him and pretend      So now you thank him carefully, oh no   'Cause that's the way he's going to be, oh no   I hope you find some reason to be free      There is no sunshine in your eyes   You make no sound and yet you cry   It's not the double cross   You feel the love you lost, oh no   This letter has to say goodbye      So now you thank him carefully, oh no   'Cause that's the way he's going to be, oh no   I hope you find some reason to be free      You saw them in the park   The laughter in the dark, oh no   How can you face him and pretend      So now you thank him carefully, oh no   'Cause that's the way he's going to be, oh no   I hope you find some reason to be free.My new purple shoes   Been amazin' the people next door   And my rock 'n roll forty fives   Been enragin' the folks on the lower floor      I got a way with the girls on my block   Try my best to be a real individual   And when we go down to smokies and rock   They line up like it's some kind of ritual   Oh give me a good guitar   And you can say that my hair's a disgrace   Or just find me an open car   I'll make the speed of light outta this place      I like the good things in life   But most of the best things ain't free   It's the same situation just cuts like a knife   When you're young and you're poor and you're crazy   Young and you're crazy...

"The cyclist’s features around him affected him negatively. He was cycling through “the high deserts of California in June” (Kurmaskie @NUM1). His water bottle was slowly running outand the only town he came to that had water had water that tasted like batteryacid. Events seemed pretty bad, until the speaker became elated when they saw a @ORGANIZATION1 factory. The author was thirsty and the side of the building had “A sandblasted picture of a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth” (Kurmaskie @NUM1). The building was abandoned. The speaker then states “Somehow  I climbed away from the abandoned factory of juices and dreams, slowly gaining elevation while losing hope” (Kurmaskie @NUM3). He lost hope after that landscape, and he pretty much gave up. The landscape or features affected the author very negatively due to the lack of water.    .Turn off the TV   And look only at me..I saw the boy break out of his skin..Do it with me   So good...

"In the essay “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” the features of the setting affects the cyclist in many ways. One thing is the water. There is little water and it is boiling hot. He took some taste of it. He said “It tasted like battery acide.” To me if the water is hot don’t taste it. Another thing is the land. The land went from straight to hilly. That started slowing him down. Last, is the day time. It started turning dark and he was still biking. He wanted to get as far as he could..You are my loved one, you are my all   Come to my arms and love me forever   I've waited so long   You are the reason for bluebird songs   You are my loved one, you are the reason   I've waited so long   Time never mattered till you left me in vain   My heart was shattered, put it together and then   Heaven will love us, surely you know   That stardust will twinkle above us   I've waited so long.At the start, every day was Sunday,   Till we went on our way one fine night..Hard times, hard times, come again no more..If I'm frightened then I can hide it   If I'm crying, I'll call it laughter   If I am haunted, I'll call it my imaginary friend   If I am bleeding I'll call it wine      But if you leave me then I am broken   And If I'm broken then only death remains      If I am drifting, then I can fight it   If I am sinking, no-one will know it   If I am blinded I'll have my voices to guide me   If they yet fled away I'd bless the silence      But if you leave me then I'm broken   And If I'm broken then only death remains.(Doot-Do-Do-Doo)      Don't You want to Know?.[Chorus]   Cause this is devotion, I am lost   You're the only one I see   Our bodies in motion, I am caught   Floating in your gravity   Whenever you break, I'll fix it for you   I'm the one who drives to you at night   And maybe we'll fall a little deeper   I think our little hearts will be alright   Cause this is devotion      [Bridge]   Cause this is devotion, I am lost   You're the only one I see   Our bodies in motion, I am caught   Floating in your gravity      [Chorus]   Cause this is devotion, I am lost   You're the only one I see   Our bodies in motion, I am caught   Floating in your gravity   Whenever you break, I'll fix it for you   I'm the one who drives to you at night   And maybe we'll fall a little deeper   I think our little hearts will be alright   Cause this is devotion.I had to know how far was going too far   In proper homes throughout the land, Fathers try to understand   Why Eunice who is seventeen aspires to live her life like me      Oh no, can't ya see, Daddy?"
" Some features of the setting that affect the cyclist is he is riding a bike through the dessert. He says “I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.” So he was scortching hot peddling a bike. The road became bumpy and curry. A sign had said “Rough Road Ahead: Do not exceed posted Speed limit. The speed limit was @NUM1 and he was going @NUM2 so it must have been hard to get over all the bumps. The lastly he comes across and poisioness snake blocked the majority of the pavement infront of me.” So him dehydrated trying to get ground a snake would be terrifying. So on his @CAPS1 the setting doesn’t help him much.  .Where I am?.Could you show me what life is about?.Better learn how to sing..What pommery!.And the man said   Give me a drink   And the barman said oooooooohhhhh   Closed circuit t.v..I used to cry myself to sleep at night   But that was all before she came   I thought love had to hurt to turn out right   But now you're here it's not the same   It's not the same      She builds me up   She gives me love   More love than I've ever seen   She's all I got   She's all I got in this world   And she's all the woman that I need      And in the morning when I kiss her eyes   She takes me down and rocks me slow   And in the evening when the moon is high   She holds me close and won't let go   She won't let go      She builds me up   She gives me love   More love than I've ever seen   She's all I got   She's all I got in this world   And she's all the woman that I need.Never a word, a word so true   Passed between us, me and you   Heard you found your pot of gold   That's the story I've been told      Never a word was said in vain   Some were never sad again   Some were lost in lovers' heat   Some lay fallen at our feet      All day all night   You and only you   All day all night   I think of you and only you      Never a word escaped my lips   Silenced by your fingertips   I kept my word, can you believe   All this time so hard to breathe   Hard to breathe"
"“Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” is an inspiring and almost humorous essay it take the reader inside a journey in a cyxlist daily routine. In this story the author fights dehydration as he tries to make to a national park with shortcut directions from “old timers” the setting of this storygreatly affects the cyclist and the pitty the reader feels for him. Half way through the essay, the biker had already traveled roughly @NUM1 miles; that’s extremely crazy. The fact that he is travelling through California deserts in June is even harder to believe. The first time he mentions the setting, he states he is in a ghost town, two sentences after he states that the sun was beating down. At that point he wasn’t really bothered. Another description of his setting that probably affected his ability to peddle was when he states “flat road was replaced by short rolling hills.” He was already dehydrated and had already traveled so far, the rocky roads probably didn’t help his journey much. The setting basically made the story. If he wouldn’t have been peddling in the desert, it would have just been another trip in his life. The setting makes the reader see what cyclist really go through. .Some folks cheat and some folks lie   I can judge a man by the look in his eyes   So don't hand me Jack and try to call it Cola   I know the difference 'tween shit and shinola   I was born in the sweet hot Florida sunshine   Good lookin' women backwoods and moonshine   Learned more about life on the streets than in the school   Sweet Mama didn't raise no fool (No she didn't)   Play it boys..

"THERE ARE VAST FEATURES IN THE SETTING THAT AFFECTS THE CYCLIST. IN SEVERAL WAYS ONE FEATURE WOULD BE THE “SUN BEGINNING TO HEAT DOWN,” AS THAT MADE THE CYCLIST HOT AND THIRSTY. THE THIRSTY-NESS REDUFROM HIM TO USE HIS LIMITED SUPPLY OF WATER. SO THE SUN WAS ABLE TO EFFECT HIM A COUPLE OF WAYS. ANOTHER FEATURE THAT CAUSED SOME PROBLEMS FOR THE CYCLIST WERE THE RUN DOWN “GHOST TOWNS” THAT CONSISTS OF “RAM-SHACKLE SHEDS” AND “SEVERAL RUSTY PUMPS.” THESE FEATURES LED THE CYCLIST TO FEEL HOPELESSNESS, AS WELL AS THE PROBLEM THAT THEY DIN’T HAVE ANY WATCH FOR THEM TO FEEL UP WITH AS HE BECAME DEHYDRATED.  OBSTACLES SUCH AS “TUMBLEWEEDS” AND “PAVEMENT BLOCKING SNAKES” ALSO PLAYS A ROLE IN AFFECTING THE CYCLISTS AS HE MOVE ON THE “@NUM1 ROAD” ONLY DOING “12 MPH.” ONE FINAL, AND LAST OBSTACLE WAS THE TERRAIN HE RODE ON.

"Anyone who has ever rode a bike knows how relaxing it can truly be, but when you are forced to ride miles and miles on @CAPS3 terrain without any water, relaxation feels like an oasis, @CAPS1 through beat-up roads with dryness all around you really puts a domper on your experience, @CAPS2  it extends your need for thirst by enhancing the amount of dryness in the air and the amount of energy you are having. The ability to block all of that out and trying to focus on something easier to handle is exactly what you want to do in these situations, @CAPS3 terrain can really build character into a cyclist, but  adding the fact the amount of water he had and the dryness around him, it sounds like torture. I can only hope that if I ever become a cyclist, I never have to endure this kind of situation..And I swear you're just like a pill,   Instead of makin' me better,   You keep makin' me ill,   You keep makin' me ill!.What you, what you want nigga?).Come all ye friends, I'll sit you down   And sing an oleful ditty   T'was on a day in April month   We started from the city   We planned a day or two at Mahers   We stalwart men were chosen   To remove old Charlie from Angle Pond   Who fell in when the pond was frozen      We seven men came roaring down   On the road to Roaches Line   We might have stopped in Avondale   Or Brigus might have been fine   We was hungry as sin but we never stopped in   Nor took any time to park us   We all of us knew that we must get through   To remove old Charlie's carcass      [Chorus]   Here's to Charlie Horse   Here's to Shave the Master   No better horse ne'er ran the course   Nor pulled the logs more faster   Here's to Charlie Horse   And I want ye all to know   Charlie's gone to the big corral   Where all good horses go      In the car was Ol' Pocket Comb   And beside him Old Moose Coosten   And Barracuda Bill and Jimmy Clark   In the back seat he was roostin'   There was Smiley Stubborn and the Mounted Police   It wasn't hard to find him   And Johnny Pollack and Sagebrush Sam   Was sitting right in beside him   Kevin and Buck was also there   But they brought some brawn and brains   They was aiming to help as best they could   To remove old Chuck's remains   Charlie was like a brother to Shave   And he loved him well of course   Charlie was a very good man you see   Although he'd been a horse      [Chorus]      Now I'll spare you all the gruesome details   And just relate the end   With two stout doors and a few strong ropes   We removed old Shady's friend   We gave him a decent sendoff   With all our hats removed   So long as we helped old Shave and his friend   Our loyalty was proved   Somewhere up in the great beyond   His eyes are shining bright   Charlie nods an approving nod   'Cause he knows we did him right   Shave will join him there one day   And he'll bring the harness leather   And so for all of eternity   They'll pull the logs together      [Chorus].So listen, listen to me,   Ooh you must believe me,   I can feel your eyes go throught me,   But I don't know why..Now once it was told to me   We're born

breeze   A vision approached me as cool as you please   With her strawberry hair and a wink in her eye   To say I was smitten would not be a lie   Gathering courage I started to speak   To ask of her name but my heart felt too weak   Like I'd gone to heaven before I had died   I mumbled the question she calmly replied 'kathleen'   Well I remember my first motorbike   With her riding pillion I'd not heard the like   Of her giggles and squeels as we leaned left and right   And feeling her arms round my chest holding tight   Whilrwind romances were never my speed   But this one took off like a runaway steed   When she said she was having the time of her life   I knew then this vision would soon be my wife, kathleen   Oh kathleen the memories you've left me   They'll be with me through all of my days   Thinking there's safety in numbers no doubt   Acounts for the fact that the wholw town turned out   To behold how serenely she walked down the aisle   But trembled and blushed as I kissed her sweet smile   Picnics on beaches and punts on the lake   Luck seemed to serve us a slice of life's cake   That was more than enought to sustain us through years   When laughter would somehow give way to some tears kathleen   Oh kathleen the memories you've left me   They'll be with me through all of my days   Then at the ball she looked ever so sweet   Heavy with child but still light on her feet   Every head turned our way as we whirled o'er the floor   And I love her more than I'd loved her before   (instrumental)   Two caring children siobhan and marie   A grand little grandchild to bounce on my knee   They're a fine testimonial to all that was right   In keeping our candle of love burning bright, kathleen   Now as my life nears it's own eventide   It's almost as though she were here by my side   Such a presence an aura so perfectly made   My beautiful vision that never will fade kathleen.Relying on rhetoric...

"In the stories, don’t exceed posted speed limit, there are some very descriptive settings. In the stories these settings have a great effect on the cyclist. Through these our settings the effects change. Some good effects some harsh effects. The first setting that is described do you is, ""the cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite had my name written all over them."" This setting gives you a vivid picture of were the cyclist is heading. This setting also establishes a happy sort of mood. Let the pretty picture is about to change. Not so much further in to the cyclist ride he noticed a change of terrain,"" flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills."" @CAPS1 the cyclist is short on water, and is becoming very tyered. Seeing this just crushes his spirit. @CAPS1 riding hills hard, but ridding hills with our knowing of something good waiting for you on the other side of the hills. Both of these, very different settings gives off very different feeling. The first one makes you think he is going to have as easy enjoy able bike ride. But this all changes when he hit those horrible hills. Just the thought of having so ride over miles of hills, makes your legs hurt. Over all the features of the setting saposed an intense bike ride for the cyclist, followed by a reward by beautiful place.      .Some guys fall in love with one girl, I gotta fall for two   There's just so much loving that one heart's supposed to do   So I go around with my heart dragging on the ground   Dogging me around, I'm the sorriest sight in town      [Chorus]   I got double trouble, I got double trouble   I got double trouble twice as much as anybody else oh yeah!.""Senor?"".Will everybody slip?.I caught her out (caught her out) one Sunday morning (Sunday morning)   With a man they call Big Dave   Meanest man (meanest man) in Waycross, Georgia (Waycross, Georgia)   I'd rather fight a Mountain Lion in Miller's Cave..(Dolly Parton)   Bobby's arms, they are warm when he holds me   Bobby's arms always comfort and console me   When I'm in his arms held tight   I know everything's alright   Just as long as I'm inside bobby's arms   Chorus:   Bobby's arms always welcome me inside   Bobby's arms always hold me when I cry   Bobby's arms are my shelter from life's storms   And I feel so safe in Bobby's arms   Bobby's arms, they are strong but they're tender   Bobby's arms reach for me and I surrender   When he reaches out for me, I'm never out of reach   And I always want to be in Bobby's arms   Repeat Chorus.Watching my window I was led like a   Child   As the roadway lamplight's   Misguided my mind through the night   A shadow of limits   We were racing the rain   My hands held the wheel   My eyes tried to hold their place      There must have been a time   When I thought that you were   Watching   It had to be when my senses lost   Control   I thought I'd slipped away   I thought I could still feel us   Moving   It must have been a cloud   No bigger than a man's hand      Every reason I risk my life   To come back to you   Is locked behind your door   You're my immunity   Outside I watched you burn   Heavy hearts were bleeding   A cry for help, a familiar voice   My melting hands streaked the glass      As I walked away   I wondered what had really   Happened   Had I run out of time   Did I push myself too far   As my last step fell   I felt my hands upon the wheel   Had I come back to life   Or did I ever leave at all      In higher lives   We seem to be   Always a moment too late   We're past the time   When we looked on   Now we're   The ones who help to   Set the sun   This time for real   I locked the door behind me   My mind was still a wreck   From what I saw   For when my hands are still   I'll recognize the message   Never again will my senses lose   Control   In higher lives   We seem to be   Always a moment too late   We're past the time   When we looked on   Now we're   The ones who help to   Set the sun.I love you, I love you, I love you, earth."
"The setting of the essay didn’t really help the author at all on his journey. There were not many structures on the way. Either that, of the towns said to be, “a ghost town.” @CAPS1 this couldn’t have reassured the author that things were going his way. It also was very hot during his journey. The author says he is “traveling through the deserts of California in June.” Deserts are very hot places and June is during summer which is the hottest month so it had to have been extremely hot and humid. @CAPS1 all this must have taken a toll because he never really saw anything reassuring until the last town he reached with the bait store. So the setting definitely had to have affected his confidence and his energy levels..I wish you'd change your mind and stay   It's really much too late to play games   All I want is just to talk with you   I'll even sing it if you want me to      You know my motives are sincere   And the love's the reason that we're here   Seeing you just makes me want to say   Won't you change your mind for me and stay      I just want to feel your arms about me   Is that too much to ask or do   You think that I'd be asking too much   I wish you'd change your mind and stay      It's really much too late to play games   All I want is just to talk with you   I'll even sing it if you want me to.It's okay   It's no fun..

"The setting in the story ""Rough road ahead” plays a great role on the characters journey. Some features that are mentioned in the story are heat, rough road, long crippling hills and a abandoned Grape Juice Factory. The heat in the story drives the cyclist into a dying thirst. @CAPS1 does her best to conserve her water through out the trip but the dry dessert heat doesn’t allow it. Then comes the rough road ahead. The cyclist trys to keep a steady and secure pass as @CAPS1 peddels along the bumps and breaks in the road. The long crippling hills are next in line the cyclist has to use all her energy to work up the hill. @CAPS1 wipes the sweat from her eyes to make sure its not a mirage and then @CAPS1 see’s it the abandoned factory. This is where the cyclist loses all hope for if @CAPS1 doesn’t receive water soon @CAPS1 is sure to be eaten by the birds. “Then, and easily as rounding a band, my troubles, thirst, and fear were all behind me. Gary and Wilber Fish Camp.” @CAPS1 rushed to the bathroom to drink the refreshing water to the sink pride and accomplishment overwhelm her..You know I'm here stay never cocky now   With bottles we poppin' now   No telling where we stopping now   And I represent the chick a-g-o   On the track with F-A-B-O   You know we      [Chorus].These slippery people   Gonna see you through.(Hey) Check it out   Check it out   Check it out   Check it out   Check it out   Check it out   Check it out   Check it out   Check it out   Check it out   (Yeah yeah, I'm feeling it now-ow)   Check it out   Check it out   Check it out   Check this mother-fucker out!.That was then, (that was then) this is now..All night stand,   With a different girl each night..I couldn't ask for more..[Chorus]   Running for our lives,   At least we're pretending we are."
"Alot of factors effected the cyclist. Temperature, terrain, directions all gave the cyclist doubt. The temperature through the high deserts of california left the cyclist feeling hot, parched and irratable. Through the story, he had all but a few slips of his water left. Knowing your running low of water “to feel sorry for himself” The cyclist had biked so far the terrain started to change from flat to “rolling hills”. This could impact someone greatly who has never biked on different levals before. Lastly, the feeling of hoped could have effected him the most. Not believing in yourself is the hardest thing to overcome. Having just liesurly taken instructions by an old man cost the cyclist hours of torture. The author did a great job using hyperbole to exagerate the cyclists feeling of lost hope . He also used very detailed text to paint the reader a picture. These literay elements made it easier for me to understand the effect of the temp, terrain and hope had on the biclist..Policeman:   Lance-not      Teacher:   Guinevere?.We will always be ruled by the heart!.I was always, baby, I was always   Well almost always true to you   Met a pretty mademoiselle   Her papa owned a small hotel   Oh, I was almost always true to you      I resisted tho' my arm was twisted   I was almost always true to you   Stayed away from drinkin' wine   Thought about you all the time   Oh, I was almost always true to you      Kept refusin' don't jump to conclusions   I was almost always true to you   I would never grab like this   I would never steal a kiss   Oh, I was almost always true to you.Now there is wind in my sails..I've long since retired, my son's moved away   I called him up just the other day   I said ""Id like to see you if you don't mind""   He said ""Id love to Dad, if I could find the time..If today the sun should set on all my hopes and cares   There is one whose smiling face that god would see   For she'll walk along beside me up those golden stairs   Oh, they'll never, never take her love from me..Why the sun?"
"The features of the setting affected the cyclist, by putting him in unwanted places starting off with this man took advice from many older men, which don’t even know the area anymore. So riding through this man seems lost, he is trying to follow their advice, but comes across many unknown, unwanted areas. He starts out good, then comes to a “Rough Road” and he even says “sometimes life can feel so cruel”. Then he come to this large snake in the middle of the road scary enogth he has to slow ride past this thing taking up most of the road. Coming over these thing was very strong and hard of this young man..Break out, shout   Shakedown from Chicago   Break out, jump   One, two, three, four      Put the rhythm in my bones   Listen to my saxophone.Well there's a pain in my side   But I keep traveling on   Bring peace to this troubled land   It's dark out here   I can't read those signs   Bring peace to the troubled land   Hurricane on the horizon   Judgment getting closer all the time   I can't find tomorrow   Bring peace to this troubled land      Well there's two men a walking   Down the same dirty road   Bring peace to this troubled land   They stand shoulder to shoulder   Carrying the same heavy load   Bring peace to this troubled land   One man's eyes are full of sorrow   The other man's belly full of unbearable pain   They keep getting closer   Bring peace to this troubled land      I've got many screaming children   Ten million rows to hoe   Bring peace to this troubled land   Deader than an hammer   But I can't let go   Bring peace to this troubled land   The eyes of heaven are upon you   But so is the soul from down below   They'll cut off your fingers   To bring peace to this troubled land      Well you can stand up and holler   You can lay down and die   Bring peace to this troubled land   We can turn up our collars   And never even try   To bring peace to this troubled land   Beware of those who want to harm you   And drag you down to a lower game   Just know the truth is coming   To bring peace to this troubled land      I got a pain in my side   But I keep traveling on.[Chorus]      Oh love.Now don't forget me, 'cause if you let me, I will always stay by you..The devil's got a hold of my soul and he won't let me be..I will be your lifeline   If your ship goes down   The way that I see it   You've got to have faith in me      I want to be your partner   Through the darkest nights   The way you see it   It's always just you and me      Midnight screamers   Daytime dreamers   What do you see in your crystal ball for you?.Last night she said   Oh, baby   I feel so down   Oh, and turned me off   When I feel left out   So I   I turned around   Oh, baby   I don't care no more   I know this for sure   I'm walking   Out that door      Well, I've been in town   For just about fifteen   Ehole minutes now   Oh, baby, I feel so down   And I don't know why   I keep walking for miles      But the people   They don't understand   No, girlfriends   They can't understand   Your grandsons   They won't understand   On top of this   I ain't ever   Gonna understand      Last night she said   Oh, baby   Don't feel so down   Oh, and turned me off   When I feel left out   So I, I turned around   Oh, baby   I'm gonna be alright   It was a great big lie   Cuz I left that night   Yeah      Oh, people   They don't understand   No, girlfriends   They don't understand   In spaceships   They won't understand   And me   I ain't ever   Gonna understand      Last night she said   Oh, baby   I feel so down   She had turned me off   When I feel left out   So I   I turned around   Oh, little girl   I don't care no more   I know this for sure   I'm walking   Out that door, yeah"
"In the story “Rough Road Ahead” a cyclist takes some out of rate information from a couple of old guys as he went along following there directions he found out that there directions were out of rate and at points dangerous. Also the setting didn’t help because he was in a desert with ghost towns and it was very hot it didnt help him believe he was going to make it out alive. For example in the story when he enters the  fork in the road it says he found “several rusty pumps,” and “one ramshackle shed.” This probably didnt help him because he didn’t have alot of water left and it was really hot and he was losing confidence in himslef that he went get out and there were rusty pumps so he couldn’t get any water that was good. Also in the story it says that “There was no one in sight, not a bulding, car, or structure of any kind” and that setting affected him because in this part in the story he has cycled for a while and he has no water left and he is getting very exhausted a almost has no energy. Also it decreased his hopes because it says there wasnt a building, or a car anything so it was pretty, much a empty dessert that he was stuck in and he thought he wouldn’t setent of the dessert alive. In conclusion in the story “Rough road ahead” the setting in the story didn’t help the cyclist in his hope or confiendce of setting out because the setting was very abanded and also it was very hot and it didn’t help that he was in a desert..How do you get your sleep at night?.Sendin' out the message to all of my friends,   We'll be lookin' flashy in my Mercedes Benz..Pistol grip pump on my lap at all times   Pistol grip pump on my lap at all times   Pistol grip pump on my lap at all times   They can be fucking with other niggas shit, but they can't be fucking with mine   Pistol grip pump on my lap at all times   Pistol grip pump on my lap at all times   Pistol grip pump on my lap at all times   They can be fucking with other niggas shit, but they can't be fucking with mine      I was raised in the hood called what the diffrence   The brothers in the hood be Chivalrous   So i rest defense on my ligaments   Pistol grip pump on my lap, riskin it   Full life living it, never giving it back   Too late for slipping, so slack up   On my lap its on your lips so track shot   A steel dick more clip for pump but   All I'm saying there ain't no question who the man is   In my civic or in this show biz   I drill the fool, kill the fool   Come on what you say?.Hey, we are recording now start..Night turns to daylight   And things are quite the same   You wake up and make up   Another day's routine   Then the sun begins to shine as if   The face of god were near   And a trumpet sound is played as if   All the world could hear      [Chorus:]   That's the day when the wind blows   That's the day when the earth begins to move   When the lion and the lamb start walking   Two by two   That's the day when the wind blows   When the sky is torn in two   And the lord of lords in all his glory   Comes for you   Oh, when the wind blows      Beside you, behind you   Believers on their knees   And somehow you know now   Everyone you see   So hand-in-hand you fly away   To meet him in the sky   This man that you have dreamed about   He's right before your eyes      [Chorus: Repeat 2X]      That's the day when the earth begins to move   When the lion and the lamb start walking   Two by two   When the wind blows   When the sky is torn in two   And the lord of lords in all his glory   Comes for you oh, when the wind blows   Well be swept away, swept away   When the wind blows.So long we've been married last burden we've carried   Though fate kept us humble and made our love true   But plans that we'd make up someone seems to break up   Oh darling what else can we do   We may have to leave here to find piece of mind dear   Some place where we can live a life all our own   I know you love me and happy we could be   If some folks would leave us alone      They say you are leavin' that you are deceivin'   But you tell me they say the same about me   But we'll show them there on that loose talk and do harm   And hope that's the truth they will see   We may have to leave here      When I go out walkin' there's lots of loose talkin'   They say we're unhappy and we'll break apart   But darling that's not true because I still love you   And I do with all of my heart   We may have to leave here.lost my stash and my virginity   In this Cockamamie Business      Got my face on Ed Sullivan broke my heart on the Soul Train   Introduced to Bad Company lost cells down at Brain Drain   And before I could mend lost the missus, missed the girlfriend   In this Cockamamie Business      Now we like to air condition though the air has no ozone ring   Still they're chopping down the forest for McDonalds and the Burger King   Eating cows with such persistence doesn't offer much resistance   To this Cockamamie Business      There are too many things stressing out the nervous system   Girls you used to know fellas that may have kissed'em   Some got rabies some got fleas some got incurable diseases   From this Cockamamie Business      Everybody's after as many points as they can get   As long as it's not them that has to pay   No one really minds the Debt   5-Star actors, tax inspectors, film producers and directors   With their Cockamamie Business      Well you do what you can can't do much more than that   (No you can't do what he just said)   Some days you're pretty sharp on other days you feel half dead   (While you make your daily bread)   Didn't want to be a star wanted just to play guitar   In this Cockamamie Business"
"In the text, the author was cycling to Yosemite park through a desert which dehydrated him and changed his mood. Going through this desert he ran out of water so he stopped. Some of the  towns he was told of which turned out to be deserted, and as he could not find water there he soon because dehydrated. This is the obvious affect the setting had on him, another affect was to cause him to doubt old people and to change his mood from confident to desperate. As he was cycling through the desert, desperately chinging to life in hopes he could find, are water, he realized that old people know of the past better than the future as they don’t get out to the every changing world as much as they used to whereas, at the beginning he was confident in the directions and wisdom of the old men. The setting he was in made him a little more wise..Born here or a thousand miles away   There,s always men nearby who'll say      Chorus      The sleeve notes from 'Live at the Point""   Has two extra verses (added by Christy)      Six in the morning out in Inchicore   The guards came through the wagon door..Don't it make you feel ashamed of yourselves?.So if I hang up on you, it's just because he's coming."".Let me lock in the system at Warp 2   Push it on into systematic overdrive, you know what to do      Let's cruise past all the golden poo   That makes me blue   This thing gonna ?.The best rapper alive (huh, yup)   The best rapper alive (huh, yup)   The best rapper alive (huh, yup)   The best rapper alive (huh)   Swagger right check, game tight   And they goin', R-E-S-P-E-C-T me (who?).that's fine!.Make some long distance calls?"
"In the story, the rider faced several meloncholy sites. For examples the “ghost town” that he ran into at first really put a load on him because he had no one to ask for futher directions or somewhere to freshen up. Futher on down the road the hill he came up on was a physical obsticle that he had to go over. With the sun beating on his back and the emptiness of the road he might have begin to want to turn back. He kept on persaveering which was how he made it down. The lack of water also mad it difficult for him. Traveling with his water running out and beginning to feel sick did not go well with him..It's plain to see, the sun won't shine today   But I ain't in the mood for sunshine anyway   Maybe I'll go insane   I got to stop the pain   Or maybe I'll go down to see Kathleen..To all my Bronx ""Niggas!!.Just a poor mountain lad   The devil must have been his dad   Lord, I've seen a lot of trouible in my time..Crying over you in the morning   Crying over you in the evening   Crying over you, don't know what to do   You make me feel ashamed, people say   It's all in the game, woman please let me explain   Then I know you will be mine   Everyday I pray   To have you and to hold   Now that you are here by my side   I really, really don't want to cry, cry   Crying over you in the morning   Crying over you in the evening   Crying over you, don't know what to do   You make me feel ashamed, people say   It's all in the game, woman please let me explain   Then I know you will be mine   And I will stop crying, crying over you   And I will stop sighing, sighing, don't know what to do   Dying, dying, every day   Sighing, sighing.The attraction is held like a weight deep inside,   Something I'll never forget..Have you heard how Sonny's burning   Like some bright erotic star?.That I would dance my whole life through   With only you ."
"The features of the nearby setting affect the cyclist in a bad way. The four main things that affect him are the heat, lack of water, lack of nearby buildings, and @CAPS2. For this cyclist one of the biggest problems is the heat. He says” i was travelling through the high deserts of California in June”. this shows that it is quite hot outside by the month stated. June is quite a hot month especially in @CAPS1 deserts. The second problem is the cyclist lack of water. He says throughout the story how thirsty he is and how much he needs to drink some water. When he reaches the end, however he finds water. The third problem is when he needs water, he can’t find anywhere due to the lack of buildings. He pedals great distances trying to find “towns” nearby. Once he finds them, they are either “ghost towns” or are not useful at all. The final problem he faces is the @CAPS2. He says “At some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake… blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me.” @CAPS2 is getting in his way and not helping him to reach his destination at all. Truly . the features of the nearby setting are affecting him in a tramatizing way, because so many things like heat, lack of water , buildings, and @CAPS2 are inches way..Could be rain, could be snow,   But it can't feel as cold as what you're feeling inside..James Dean, you said it all so clean   And I know my life would look alright   If I could see it on the silver screen..It's all?.He blew his mind out in a car   He didn't notice that the red lights had changed   A crowd of people stood and stared   They'd seen his face before   Nobody was really sure   If he was from the House of Lords..Temper with what is true   And children will turn,   If just to be free..Do I dare speak to him?.The day has come at last."
" The features of the setting effected the cyclist. The setting was a desert in California making it VERY hot outside. The hills were hard to climb and there were dangers all around such as poisonous snakes. Not just this was terrain hard to move around on but the path was thickest. “@CAPS1 weeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake.” This made it harder for the cyclist to reach his destination..When the broken are strong   (Freak the mighty, Freak the mighty)   When the beaten are proud   (Freak the mighty, Freak the mighty)   When the twisted can stand   (Freak the mighty, Freak the mighty)   When the silenced can laugh   (Freak the mighty, Freak the mighty)   When the hunted have turned   (Freak the mighty, Freak the mighty)   When the tortured are sane   (Freak the mighty, Freak the mighty)   When the blinded still stare   (Freak the mighty, Freak the mighty)   When the poisoned remain   (Freak the mighty, Freak the mighty)   When the voiceless can sing   (Freak the mighty, Freak the mighty)   And the shackled can run   (Freak the mighty, Freak the mighty)   And this downtrodden man holds his face to the sun   (Freak the mighty, Freak the mighty)   We?ll be walking high above the world..Sky above was never so blue..Got love and affection..A round of applause, you got what you want   Take a good look at what you give up   Because I'm telling you   A heart can't be unbroken, oh, oh      And can you remember how I kiss you   Recall the sweet taste in your mouth   'Cause baby, the memory is all you get now   And I'm moving, moving, moving on      All that you want   I hope you get all that you want   I hope you get all that you want   'Cause I didn't      I hope you get all that you want   I hope you get all that you want   I hope you get all that you want   'Cause I didn't      Does every morning make you happy?.I don't even have, uh   If I had twenty cents a dollar like you   I'd spend the last one   This guy's got twenty cents, I'd bet you..Green green of her eyes..Buying a round for total strangers."
"The setting of this story takes place with a man biking and then taking advice from old timers to a faster route. The biker knew from the start that he should have not given his map. But thinking the old folks knew the route he took theyre advice. What the biker should have done was look for someone to ask and make sure the route would work. But jumping to where he wanted to go led him to dehydration and much more struggle than needed. You should always think things out before you take action, just to be safe..Swear, swear to your heart (swear)   That you're never never gonna leave me   Swear, swear to your heart   That you're never gonna go   I, I wanna hear   That you're always always gonna love me   Swear, swear to your heart      We've got to make a solemn vow, keep it forever,   Know whatever happens that somehow, we'll keep it together      I'll pledge my heart, I'll pledge my soul to you   Just take my hand, and say that you....Loving life now,   Living on top of..Nowhere to hide..That was the day that the coke came to nashville,   That was the day I laughed till I cried..You're over there..Applicant, I am   Clean young flesh   Cubicles, we merge   And me so decent      Lock up my vehicle   Crack my walls   I'm stealing new words   And me so honest      Someone took pictures   Just look at her go   Her presence exhausted me   Like spectators we are      I have no address   'Who are you?'.The fishes will laugh as they swim out of the path   And the seagulls, they'll be a smilin?"
"In the essay, “Rough Road Ahead:Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” the setting the cyclsit is in effects him greatly. One evening when he was resting he got into a deep conversation with a couple of elders. Eventually they got to talking about his journey, and the two men gave him direction for a shortcut. “But on that morning it fit the traditional definition of a ghost town.” When he arrives at the first town, he finds it deserted, this effects the cyclist because has eventually going to need more water. As he continues, he comes to a slep in the road. “After I had arrested the first few of these a large highway sign jumped out at most read:ROUGH ROAD AHEAD:DO NOT EXCEED POSTED SPEED LIMIT” This sign was indicating that the road was going to be bumpy, which makes it even more challamging for the cyclsit. So, the setting is very important in this essay because it has a lot to do with how the cyclist feels. When the abandoned towns come into pray, no enging to feel hopeless. When the road get bumpy, he gets tired. When he gets to an actual running store, he’s relieved..Ooh!.What can I say man I hit him with the brick   Killed the little prick him and his chick   Tried to be slick but you ain't slinky   You're brinky you're dinky you suck my twinkie   I don't give a fuck if you call me a clown   Break it on down it's murder go round   What'cha dishing out I betcha ya it comes back to ya   If you're trying to creep I'd hate to say I never knew ya   Once upon a time in the ghetto zone   A ten-foot led pipe slapped on my dome   I'm laying in the street with blood oozing out my head   Excuse me, motherfucker, was it something I said   Forks up, forks down, man, forks sideways   Then he grabbed my finger and he said crime pays   Swung on his pipe once again for the road   ""Hold up, dawg,"" UH!.Tell me how long, dear, do I have to wait?.Oh Lord!.Now that time is running out on him   God is out to lunch   Time is running out on his decision   Every day that passes   Proves that God has lost his glasses...

"The features of the setting affect the cyclist. It seems to be the more despirate the situation the more determand her becomes. Pg @NUM1 (I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean). Right after he thinks this he climbed away for the abandoned factory of Juices and dreams. He says pg @NUM1 come troubles, thirst and tean where all behind me, this shows that after a situation the bilaver tells realeoved of all earthley obligations.

"In Joe Kurmaskie’s essay “Rough Road Ahead,” the speaker is biking through some rough terrain in blistering heat, not to mention long distances. He has to ride up and down small and large hills through what he believes is a shortcut to his destination. He has a limited water supply, and he keeps coming cross ghost towns, where the only water is boiling brackish water that is unfit for human consumption. Probably the worst setting feature for this guy as the Welch’s Grape Juice Factory (abandoned of course). Adding salt to the wound was “A sandblasted picture of a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth could still be seen” (kurmaskie @NUM1). To the narrator with his dwindling water supply, this billboard was especially daunting to him on his journey..They all go wild   For you and your denial   They're watching you break down (break down)   Hate me all you want,   I'll be okay   I'm half the world away   I'm letting you go now (go now)   Go now (go now)   Go now (go now)   Go now (go now).Some words when spoken...can't be taken back....-Rahman Tardjana-.I have the reputation that's known throughout the land   They say I'm master on the draw of any livin' man   They call me a bad man, they say I kill for fun   They say the only thing I know is how to use a gun   But they don't know the reason they branded me as bad   It started many years ago when I was just a lad      I rode into a cattle town, a boy of twenty-three   So young and yet that very day I carved my destiny   I walked into the town saloon that sad and faithful day   Then I began to gamble to pass the time away   I thought I played a hand or two then hit the thrill again   But Lady Luck was with me and I began to win      The dealer kept on dealin', the stakes were gettin' high   And pretty soon there was no one left but an old cowboy and I   The minutes seemed like hours, you couldn't hear a sound   We've been in race until we'd lay all our money down   The cowboy smiled and showed his hands, three aces he did hold   But I laid down the royal flush and reached to claim my gold      The cowboy stood and faced me, his hands hung on his hips   A look of hate was in his eyes and the smile had left his lips   He said, ""Young man, slap leather, I'm known for miles around   To keep my reputation about I got to gun you down""   White lightnin' speeded through that fire, one life will be the cost   The cowboy crumbled to the floor, his reputation lost      Now years have come and years have gone and many men have died   He's tried his luck and hoped he'd be the fastest gun alive   And in my many fights to live, I wondered if I'd won   I'm known by all the bad men, they think I kill for fun   Someday I'll meet the cowboy who's speed will meet the test   And that will in the saga of the bad man of the west.Oh, oh, I need some wind to take me to my goal   Land ho, will I be searching forever?.And he says no, so then I figure what the hell   I'll try cause it's my life   So light the match and you and I will....No one likes to be alone."
"The features of the setting affect the cyclist. He is trying to get water but when he tried the pump, “a tarlike substance oozed out, followed by brackish water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees”. The cyclist doesn’t have any water so it is difficult to go on. He could suffer from heat exhaustion. As he came to the next town, he found, “the building - abandoned years earlier, had been a Welch’s Grape Juice Factory and bottling plant”. He is still thinking of getting to the next town to get something to drink. That is how the features of the setting affect the cyclist..She can give you a reason to live if she wants to   She can make you forget other loves that you've known   She has two lips and two arms that thrill you as bad if you do   And if you want her to give them to you she will      Don't you believe her I did and soon she'll be leaving me   Don't you believe her I did and soon she'll be leaving you      She can tell you a lie you'll believe if she has to   And you'll trust her till time and tie both stands still   She can cry on your shoulder and swear to the things that she won't do   Ah but be careful cause when you're not looking she will   Don't you believe her   Don't you believe her.I've had a shoulder to lean on   Been the one who got to be strong   And peace was waiting at both ends   I've felt the power, I've seen what it can do   It's seemed so simple, so simple that it's true      If you want to get love then give it   If you want to feel some forgiveness   Then you've gotta let go and do some forgiving of your own   If you want a friend then be one   A little bit of kindness, show some   You'll be surprised at how much finds it's way back home   It don't matter what it is   If you want it, give..The reason you loved me before,   Baby please remember me once more      When was the last time you thought of me?.(Ain't no need to cry girl..The merry-o   Sing it high and sing it low   Let them know the wicked old witch is dead      [Harold:]   Why everyone's glad   She took such a crownin'      [Barbra:]   Bein' hit by a house   Is even worse than drownin'      [Both:]   Let 'em know the wicked old witch is dead!!.I wanna know!.Etc.)"
"The conditions that the bicyclist faced that affected his trip were various amount of things that could really screw your ride up. Some of the conditions were hot It was very hot and that makes it hard to think fast, move fast and make good decisions another would be there was lose gravel and that makes it tough to maneuver and you have to watch your speed. So he’s not going anywhere in a hurry. also there were lets of hills and that makes for an uncomfortable ride and a tiring one atthat. Adding to that he was fresh out of water and that can mean dehydration again bud judjment and even heat stroke or exoustion another bad thing is he was in the middle of nowhere so its not like he could stop. Some where we asks for a drink to, there was nothing around for miles. These things show how rough the rode was made because these conditions exsisted..Eri il ragazzo di un'altra   E non potevo parlarti   Ma tu sapessi per me   Che 'cause'era vederti e saperti felice   You were another girl's boyfriend   And I couldn't talk to you   But if you knew what it meant to me   To see you and know you were happy   Erl il ragazzo di un'altra   Ma ora tutto ?finito   E tu puoi fare di noi   Una cosa grandissima o due cose da niente   You were another girl's boyfriend   But now that's all over   And we can be one great thing   Or two nonentities - it's up to you   Sento che io faccio male   E lo so dovrei parlarti   Dirti che forse lei torna per?ora sei di fronte all'amore   Ora puoi pensare alla vita   E se per sempre mi vuoi   Non avere paura di me   I feel like I'm doing the wrong thing   And I know that I should talk to you   Tell you that maybe she'll come back   But now you're faced with love   Now you can think of life   And if you want me forever   Don't be afraid of me   Sento che io faccio male   E lo so dovrei parlarti   Dirti che forse lei torna per?ora sei di fronte all'amore   Ora puoi pensare alla vita   E se per sempre mi vuoi   Non avere paura di me   I feel like I'm doing the wrong thing   And I know that I should talk to you   Tell you that maybe she'll come back   But now you're faced with love   Now you can think of life   And if you want me forever   Don't be afraid of me.Honey, honey,   Can I put on your clothes?.And we love to wear a badge, a uniform   And we love to fly a flag   But I won't let others live in hell   As we divide against each other   And we fight amongst ourselves   Too set in our ways to try to rearrange   Too right to be wrong, in this rebel song   Let the bells ring out   Let the bells ring out   Is there nothing left?.Crying so long, over you..But she loves to play      With the dark eyes burning,   I am opening the wall..I just walked down the street to the coffee shop   Had to take a break   I'd been by her side for eighteen hours straight   I saw a flower growing in the middle of the sidewalk   Pushing up through the concrete   Like it was planted right there for me to see   The flashin' lights, the honkin' horns   All seemed to fade away   In the shadow of that hospital at 5:08   I saw God today      [Chorus]   I've been to church   I've read the book   I know He's here, but I don't look   Near as often as I should   Yeah, I know I should   His fingerprints are everywhere   I'd just slow down to stop and stare   Opened my eyes and man I swear   I saw God today      I saw a couple walking by they were holding hands   Man, she had that glow   Yeah I couldn't help but notice she was starting to show   It stood there for a minute takin' the sky   Lost in that sunset   A splash of amber melted in the shades of red      [Chorus]      I got my face pressed up against the nursery glass   She's sleeping like a rock   My name on her wrist wearing tiny pink socks   She's got my nose, she's got her mama's eyes   My brand new baby girl   She's a miracle   I saw God today.Whoa oh      I want a new duck   One that won't try to bite   One that won't chew a hole in my socks   One that won't quack all night      I want a new duck   One with big webbed feet   One that knows how to wash my car   And keep his room real neat      One that won't raid the ice box   One that'll stay in shape   One that's never gonna try to migrate or escape   Or I'll tie him up with duck tape      I want a new duck   A mallard I think   One that won't make a mess of my house   Or build a nest in the bathroom sink      I want a new duck   One that won't steal my beer   One that won't stick his bill in my mail   One that knows the duck stops here      One that won't drive me crazy waddling all around   One who'll teach me how to swim and help me not to drown   And show me how to get down   How to get down baby      Get it?"
"In the story there were many features of the setting tha affected the cyclist. One that had the greatest impact was that it was dry and hot, and that the terrain was very rough in the desert. Being that it was dry and hot made his ride hard. For example, the heat caused him to get dehydrated on his journey and begin to feel signs of heatstroke. The terrain caused an even bigger dilema. For example, in the story him riding through that terrain causes him to get tired and become even more dehydrated than he already is.   .Yes every fifteen minutes, I can drink another bottle down   And get fifteen minutes closer to that cold,cold ground, to that cold cold ground..Different hair   ""Sexually active""   Raise a screaming guitar or a bible in the air   Theater of anguish   Theater of glory   God's hired hands and the devil bands   Oh come let us adore me!.'Cause now I know the reason   It's the season of good cheer..Hakuna Matata..I'm the one who loves you, I'm the one you need..We're done, but it's not over..I fucked my way up to the top,   Go baby, go."
"The feateres of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. For example ""not two mlles into this next section of the ride, I noticed the terrain changin. Flat road was replaced by short, rolling  hills. ""This affected the cyclist because he had to pedal  harder to go up the hills and he got short of breath due to this. Another example  is, ""At some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path and a rediculously large snake-it really did look like a diamondback-blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me.” This affected the cyclist because he had to wait for the snake to move so it didnt bite him while he crossed it. One last example is, ""As I stumbled into a rather modem bathroom and drank deeply from the sink, I had an overwhelming urge to seek out @PERSON1 and Wilber” This had an affect on the cyclist because he was now hapy to have water and have reached his destination..Loss of control   Loss of control   Loss of control   Loss of control   Loss of control   Loss of control   Loss of control   Loss of control   Loss of control   Loss of control   Loss of control   Loss of control   Baby I'm checkin' out, I think you oughta know, yeah   I'm only wastin' time, I think I better go   You ain't too civilized, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh   Loss of control   Loss of control   Loss of control      Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!.My hand is bleeding, I run back inside....In the dark   Lonely voice..Tu non lo sai   Che senza te   Ogni cosa non esiste pi?,   Anche il sole non scalda pi?....Oh please, please, oh don't you go and   Forget me down here, don't forget me, Lord..Oh no!"
"When the cyclist is in the “serenity of an early sunset evening”, the man enjoyed his cycling just hoping he could cut his time in half. Then, once he got the advice and headed down the road he saw a ghost town which is never good. Next he came to the fork and the town he came to had no water. On the way to the new town he came to the bumpy road and going @NUM1 he was out of water but finally after his determination he made it to a place that was very nice. So as you can tell the features of the scenery road affected him greatly..Cool cool water where I rest my head   You keep me running to a single bed   Yellow moon rising on the riverboat wild   You keep me running like a child      Yellow moon rising on the riverboat wild   You keep me running like a child      Bobby don't know   He's got a funny way of seeing situations   Call him on the phone   And ain't it funny but he never seems to come home      Bobby don't know   He's got a funny way of seeing situations   Call him on the phone   Ain't it strange that he never seems to go home      Cool cool water where I rest my head   You keep me running to a single bed   Yellow moon rising on the riverboat wild   You keep me running like a child.This is not your life,   I know how to do it on my own..(but I can tell you a thing or two   'bout somethin' else   If you really want to know...know what I'm sayin').What am I going to do with it, baby   Well if I can't share it with you?.And there'll be no turning back   You were only killing time and it'll kill you right back   Come on!.Fade away..Impulse always quickens when it's full   As it turns my head around me   Yes it does and here it comes   Here comes the moon, the moon, the moon, the moon, the moon."
"The features of the setting affect him because it is hot and their is no where to go. An example from the test is when they said ""There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind."" There was also a part where he got to a sign that said ROUGH ROAD AHEAD: DO NOT EXCEED POSTED SPEED LIMIT.The speed limit was 55 mph. He was doing a water a water - depleting 12 mph. Sometimes life can feel so cruel. Thats what affected the cyclist the heart the hilly roads, no water, snakes, rough roads, and most all no directions..I need love, love   Oh, ease my mind   And I need to find time   Someone to call mine      My mama said, ""You can't hurry love   No, you'll just have to wait""   She said, ""Love don't come easy   But it's a game of give and take""      You can't hurry love   No, you'll just have to wait   Just trust in a good time   No matter how long it takes      How many heartaches must I stand   Before I find the love to let me live again   Right now the only thing that keeps me hanging on   When I feel my strength, oh, it's almost gone      I remember mama said, ""You can't hurry love   No, you'll just have to wait""   She said, ""Love don't come easy   It's a game of give and take""      How long must I wait   How much more must I take   Before loneliness   Will cause my heart, heart to break      No, I can't bear to live my life alone   I grow impatient for a love to call my own   But when I feel that I, I can't go on   Well, these precious words keep me hanging on      I remember mama said, ""You can't hurry love   No, you'll just have to wait""   She said, ""Love don't come easy   Well, it's a game of give and take""      You can't hurry love   No, you'll just have to wait   Just trust in a good time   No matter how long it takes, now break      Now love, love don't come easy   But I keep on waiting   Anticipating for that soft voice   To talk to me at night   For some tender arms   Hold me tight   I keep waiting   Oh, till that day   But it ain't easy   (Love don't come easy)   No, you know it ain't easy      My mama said, ""You can't hurry love   No, you'll just have to wait""   She said, ""Love don't come easy   But it's a game of give and take""      You can't hurry love   No, you'll just have to wait   She said, ""Love don't come easy   It's a game of give and take"".That life is all just repitition   You lose or you win,   You sink or you swim,   When you go diving in the deep end,   In the deep end,   In the deep end,   In the deep end..I was waiting for an indication, it was hard to find   Don't matter what I say, only what I do   I never mean to do bad things to you   So quiet but I finally woke up   If you're sad then it's time you spoke up too      Was I out of my head or was I out of my mind?.He will never fell this way!.I ain't askin' for much..He cries:      [Chorus].From the wars against disorder,   From the sirens night and day,   From the fires of the homeless,   From the ashes of the gay,   Democracy is coming to the U.S.A."
" The cyclist thought it was hard. Also he was upset that the old timers gave bad directions..Feels like I'm ready when I'm holding you   But it's so many honey's what I'm supposed to do?.(How ya doin', Bernie?).Tell me what it's gonna be..Now Jonah now he lived in a whale..But she gotta hold on (hold on)   Wanna leave the club alone (you dead wrong)   She gotta pay the bills but in the meantime   She like ""fuck how she feel"" living is real   So she back in the club again   Taking off her clothes again   Going to school, going to work, getting tiring   Lack of sleep but baby gotta eat   and these shoes on her feet   She got a test next week so she stressed   Ask god to give her a blessing, send her in the right direction   Her parents died when she was eight years old   And after that, she felt like she was all alone   But she got her grandparents and they raised her well   Keep going to school, take care of yourself   Getting hard, going to school and work in the club   And at the same time looking for love   She can't keep skipping for an occupation   In a minute, she'll be graduating   Make her wanna throw up her hands   Now she only wanna live again      [Chorus]      [Hook]      [Chorus].Come on let'me kill ya!!!.Que Sera, Sera,   Whatever will be, will be   The future's not ours, to see   Que Sera, Sera   What will be, will be."
"In the story the author says, “The sun was beginning to beat down trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state,” This gives you the idea that the heat is getting to him and is steadily depleting his water supply. At ore point he almost gives him self up to despair and dies of dehydration. It seems that he will never reach his good and he will continue to suffer in the grueling heat. I could almost feel the sweat and heat that the cyclist was feeling. Also, I could almost feel the lump in my throat when he says, “with any luck I’d hit a bump and lodge a pebble in my throat.” The heat definitely effects this mans cycling in a bad way. He was exhausted and could not go on without water..Living off the friends we made   Never ever getting paid   Kicking ass and paying dues   Lose our mind in self abuse      Loving ladies by the score   Waking up and wanting more   I hope my Mama understands   When I strike up the band      Well I spit out my anger as the sweat do fly   Fifteen years of paying dues just to get me by   Now the barkeeps would pay us by the crowds we bring   But those son-of-bitches never paid us one damn thing   And my poor Daddy, he just don't understand   It's balls out tonight, watch the shit hit the fan   When we strike up the band      Now those drop dead ladies line the very first row   I do believe I'd like to spend some time after the show   Now them years gone by, the barkeeps pay in cash   And them lovely ladies feed me an earful of trash      And my old lady, she just don't understand   Why those floozies got their hands on her man   And my poor Daddy, he still don't understand   Why it's balls out tonight watch the shit hit the fan   Give it all that we can, we don't give a good damn   When we strike up the band      Living like a gypsy,   an air conditioned hippie   Who's never seen the light of day   Rode dog and cowboy   Don't know how, boy   I ever lived this long this way, no, no, said      And my poor Daddy, he still don't understand   Why it's balls out tonight watch the shit hit the fan   Give it all that we can, we don't give a good damn   When we strike up the band.How much love did you spend?.My intuition goes like this:   I'm playing poker with a bunch   And all at once I get a hunch   That's intuition      I'm playing aces back to back   And I can see a pair of kings   But if there's one more of those things   What's my position?.It was just silly crap that hit the spot..Oh!).Far above the highest heavens   On a throne of crystal light   Dwells the God of all creation   Rays of wonder crown His might   Human voices blend with the angels   Giving praise to God alone   Heavens music rises upward   To the Lamb upon the throne   To the Lamb upon the throne      [Chorus]   Blessing!.Is there time, have I long enough?"
"The features in the setting of the essay affect the author in one major way, dehydration. There are several features that causes the author to dehydrate. First off, he is riding throught a desert located in california. This means that there is bent from the sun constintly beating down on him. Also the change from “Flat read”, (Kurmaskie) to “short, rolling hills” (@CAPS1) also affected him, getting dehydrated. This change cased him to use more energy to climb up the hills which means he used more water because he got thrister faster. This is how the features in the setting affected the author of the essay “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit.”.Cosette   That was my cry you heard, Papa..Little Baby,   Pa rum pum pum pum   I am a poor boy too,   Pa rum pum pum pum   I have no gift to bring,   Pa rum pum pum pum      That's fit to give the King,   Pa rum pum pum pum   Rum pum pum pum,   Rum pum pum pum,      Shall I play for you,   Pa rum pum pum pum,   On my drum?.I've thought about a new beginning   But you know your heart's not in   There's something inside   That ain't hearing my call..I'm in love with you      Oooh-ooo-ooh   Oooh-oooh   Oooh-ooo-ooh   Oooh-oooh   Oooh-ooo-ooh   Oooh-oooh.There's a club if you'd like to go..Bedroom boom, (that's whats goin' down tonight),   Bedroom boom, (let me do ya body right),   My bed will be boomin' for you (boom boom)   Bedroom boom, (all between the sheets baby)   Bedroom boom, (I wanna drive you crazy),   My bed will be boomin' for you..Silent night, holy night!"
" Setting plays a big role in this story. Without being in the desert in the hot @DATE1 there would not be a confict. There would be no importance in saving the water so he would not dehiderate. And the long flat roads are a symbol that the journey has still got a far way to go but as straight roads turn into hills it shows that there is a change in the journey and something better is about to happen..There's an invitation in the post   To a reading party on the coast   Pack your bags up, you old bibliophile   Get together with your friends, who will   Give you time to think and time to kill   With independent hosts   Hey, Headmaster, aren't you gonna go?.You've got to pick-a-pocket or two, boys   You've got to pick-a-pocket or two..I thought you was the one hon yeah   When I met you at the freaknin'   Whoever thought you'd be the type to greet and keep secrets   My friends said don't sleep but I did so now I'm reapin'   Disease that I sold I can't beleive you so deceivin'   Sneakin' out on the weekends with Michelle   One of your freak friends from the east end she bad as hell   Half black and Indonesian the one that tought you treason   Cupid shoot me on my heart but damn why'd you leave it bleedin'      I gave you no reason to lie   But you choose to live untrue   Knowing how I feel inside   There's no telling what I might do   'Cause I gave you      All my mind   All my soul   From the very start   I gave you full control and you broke my heart   I tried to show you a better way of life   But I see that must be what you like   I loved you more than anything   I tried to build the future turn a house into a home   I wanted us to be one flesh and one bone   It's so hard to keep my sanity   Now I can do is sit back and reminisce   Look at the pictures in the frames yo   Why you playin' games yo      As I think back to the begining we was together   We both loved sports long walks and autumn weather   Both wanted kids and a family a strong personality   I liked the way you handled me   Candles be lit mood set food set you ready yet   That's what you said while you was massagin' my head   Now look here I could never leave you lonely   'Cause the love you showed me had me feeling like you already had known me   'Member when you used to blindfold me till I don't see   Use your mind that's what you told me   Kissin' me slowly   Never was the loud type always on the low key   Pretty style but rugged   Damn I brother I loved the      The birds of a feather 'sposed to fly together   Guess that don't apply to birds of your kind   'Cause you only wanted what you wanted like a poacher   Came to steal my heart and leave me to die   (I ain't going out like that though)      All my mind   All my soul   From the very start   I gave you full control and you broke my heart   I tried to show you a better way of life   But I see that must be what you like   I loved you more than anything   I tried to build the future turn a house into a home   I wanted us to be one flesh and one bone   It's so hard to keep my sanity   Now I can do is sit back and reminisce   Look at the pictures in the frames yo   Why you playin' games yo.Look around you all you see are sympathetic eyes,   Stroll around the grounds until you feel at home..'Cause there's still a lot of drinks that I ain't drunk   And lots of pretty thoughts that I ain't thunk   And lord there's still so many lonely girls   In this best of all possible worlds..fire!.(Olivia Newton-John)   I need to tell the truth   I can't lie anymore   I need to do what's right   I know that's what my life is for   I can't be quiet anymore   About what I'm suppose to do   I need to tell the truth   And do what's right by you   I need to speak my mind   And let my heart run free   Your pain will heal with time   And one day you'll thank me   And as I follow my dream   And there is no room for you   Just know there was no scheme   It's just what I had to do   Trust yourself--you know all the answers   Trust yourself--you know what is right   Trust yourself--they're all there inside you   They've been there forever--just show them some light   Sometimes the truth brings pain   But broken dreams regrow   Not in the same old way   But change is life you know   And as I move on   To start my song anew   Please understand my need   To do what I have to do   Trust yourself--you know all the answers   Trust yourself--you know what is right   Trust yourself--they're all there inside you   They've been there forever--just show them some light   And as life goes on   Can we still be friends?"
"The features of the setting in “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” affects the cyclist in many ways. First the setting does not look like what the cyclist has been told it lacks like. The cyclist had stopped to get directions from a group of older men who’s directions were out of date. Second the conditions of the road affects the cyclist. In the essay the cyclist explains that, ”Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.” A final feature of the setting that affected the cyclist was the temperature. The hot sun beamed down on the cyclist. As you can see, the features of the setting in ""Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit"" affects the cyclist in many ways. .Knew the time to leave had come when you pointed out your ring   Never could see what was in this matrimony thing   Baby, baby, baby you sure made a noise when I left   And your father started shouting lest you ironed my shirts   'fore I left   Would've liked to explain first but it was a split decision thing   Couldn't see me settling down with a mortgage and a kid   Now I hear you've been looking for me   Combing every single inch   You'll probably find me in Hyde Park   Try the hotel first then a bench   Baby, baby, baby I've changed my address   I didn't mean to make you cry but I know it's for the best   Baby, baby, baby I've changed my address   It's OK being in love girl, but then fun is second best   No one's gonna tie me down   Nobody tell me what to do   Don't you see I've got to be free   Sorry baby that's the way it is - get with me   I said maybe!.Play with my cross-word puzzle book, I'm even learning how to cook..Chorus   Just leave it..Ss-ah-ff-ee-tt-yy   Safety-dance!.Promises are easy made..All your spirit rack abuses   Come to haunt you back by day   All your Byzantine excuses   Given time, given you away      Don't be surprised when daylight comes   To find that memory prick your thumbs   You'll tell them where we run to hide   I'm already dead   It's a matter of time      So how do we now come to be   Afraid of sunlight   How do we now come to be   Afraid of sunlight      Day-Glo Jesus on the dash   Chalk marks on the road ahead   Friendly fire in hostile waters   Keep the faith   Don't lose your head      So how do we now come to be?.I'll smack the shit outta you bitch   (Take your black ass, the fuck outta here)   Motherfucker, you are fuckin' up   (Comin' in here, smellin' like pile of shit, dumb motherfucker)      Gizmo's cuttin', up for the   Suckers that's, down with me!"
"The cyclit of “Do not exceed posted speed limit”, was greatly affected by the setting of his bike ride, which caused him pain and displeasure. He travels in the high deserts of California in June, which he exaggerates that water there was “@NUM1 degers”. The great heat caused him to drink lots of water, depleting it much quicker than he would’ve wished. It also sopped the energy out of him, further complicating his ride. Along the way there is literally nothing there and he has nowhea  to replenish his water supply. The hilly, rough terrain also calls for hard, tough peddling, sopping even more energy. The heat, terrain, and lack of places to stop combined for an awful ride for the cyclist of this story..A very merry christmas to all of you!.On the fifth day of Christmas,   My true love sent to me   Five golden rings,   Four calling birds,   Three French hens,   Two turtle doves,   And a partridge in a pear tree..I want somebody to share, share the rest of my life,   Share my innermost thoughts, know my intimate details..Oh - can you read the hurt in my eyes?.Jesus Christ was born for this   He has opened heavens door   And man is blessed evermore   Christ was born for this   Christ was born for this      Good Christian men, rejoice   With heart and soul and voice   Now ye need not fear the grave:   Peace!.I'm a picker, I'm a grinner, I'm a lover, and I'm a sinner   I play my music in the sun   I'm a joker, I'm a smoker, I'm a midnight toker..Happy together, unhappy together,   And won't it be fine?"
"The cyclist is beginning at what seems a fine idea and place. Then the conditions become hot, dreadful, and maybe sticky. The constant heat without any breeze was getting to the character. Mirages appeared, or so he thought. He actually thought he might die. Not quite an optimistic one is he? “ It didn’t really matter. I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean…” The heat must have been bad, he wasn’t thinking straight and was slowly checking himself into a mental center! Although painful heat was a brilliant way to learn a lesson in cycling, and the old men “helping” with directions..Wake the fuck up!.To our fans far and near   We're so glad you could all be here   And when life get so-oh-oh hard   You make it all worthwhile   Screaming, shouting, wham-slam-bam   That wild headbanging style      This is dedicated to our fans across the world   You're the best, most loyalist, and that's for sure   When life gets oh so frustrating   You make it all worthwhile   Gonna have some fun tonight   Ain't it great to be alive      It's gonna be OK   It's gonna be alright   It's gonna be that you're the only ones who understand      It's gonna be OK   It's gonna be alright   It's gonna be that you're the only ones who understand      Got good feelings about this year   All is very well, C.J..Better stop dreaming of the quiet life   Cause it's the one we'll never know   And quit running for that runaway bus   Cause those rosy days are few   And, stop apologizing for the things you've never done,   Cause time is short and life is cruel   But it's up to us to change   This town called malice..Maybe she's gone, but it won't be for long, what do I know?.Run to the light   Everything is alright   Run thro' the light of day   You run to the light of night      And every movement made together   Till every thought was just the same   And all the pieces fit forever   In the game..If I had a heart I'd cry..watch the sun go down."
" The first town the cyclist came to was like a ghost town because there was nobody was there. The next town wasn’t any better because it was @NUM1 miles down the road. The cyclist faced some problems while on the journey. Some of these problems included snakes - The fact that he wos running out of water- the hill-and the condition of the road..I hear them calling..Tonight they're closing up the world   N' sweeping smoke from cigarettes   And what is that funk multi-national   Anthem rocking from a thousand   King Kong cassette decks   Then a shy boy from Missouri   Boots blown off in a sixties war   Riding aluminum crutches   Now he knows the welfare kindness n'   Agent Orange color blindness   As we works from door to door   The violence in the carpets   The mirror of his wife   Drives the slum-bum dweller   To grind his hunting knife   In homesteads of cigar box-radios   Hive like bees   The body in the ice   Box has no date for freeeeeze      [Chorus:]   In a car jam      Selling is what selling sells   But only saints of the seven avenues can sell   The hells   Fanning the drug afflicted leperizing acne   Once inside the executive   He never leaves his home   Gorillas drag their victims   Hyenas try to sue   Snakes find grass in concrete   There is no city zoo by   Ventilation units where towers   Meet the streets   The ragged stand in bags   Soaking heat up through their feet      This was the only kindness   And it was accidental too      [Chorus:]      Now shaking single engined planes   Traffik-king stereos from Cuba   Buzzed the holy zealot mass      And drowned out Missa Luba   And drowned out Missa Luba   I thought I saw Lauren Bacall   I thought I saw Lauren Bacall   I swear   Hey fellas   Lauren Bacall   In a car jam   Yeah I don't believe it   In a car jam   Ah yeah positively absolutely      [Chorus:].With the power of Your presence,   And your beauty all around me,   As the heavens stand in awe of You   Let me hear Your voice..They don't want to see you   While your friends will come   With a smiling face   And it don't mean another shoe's lace....You didn't ask me to be born   You,   Why should you learn of war or pain?.you think I'm a tell you   ""Mom, can you leave the door open a bit?"".I'm your toy, I'm your old boy   But I don't want no one but you to love me   Oh I wouldn't lie   You know I'm not that kind of guy"
"Many things that the author talks about in the story affect him: One example in the oldmen that give him advice. They tell him that they know a great shortcut which turns into the authors hardest ride ever. Another example is: the heat, the location, time of day, and time of the year. In California, in @DATE1 in the dessert will give you lots of heat. In order to beat this heat you need lots of water which is one of his biggest problems. He runs out of water. Another hindering thing he discovers is the abandoned welches grape juice building where he sees a picture of a boy drinking a refreshing glass of grape juice. All these combined gave the author a hard time but in the end he found a bait and tackle shop where he was saved.Darling let's turn back my years   And go back to yesterday   Let's pretend that time has stopped   And I didn't go away..[Verse 1]   Bite down on your lip   Take another sip   Stop checking your phone   Looking for the answers   Mind running obsessed   Feeling paralyzed   Let me watch you undress   Fall into the night      [Pre-Chorus]   Yeah, we change and we change and we feel so lost   And we don't know who we are   Yeah, we break and we break and we just can't stop   So we just keep breaking hearts      [Chorus]   Why you wanna ruin a good thing?.Monster trucks!.If somebody   Is haunting your mind   Look in my eyes   Let me hide you   From yourself and   All your old friends   Every good thing   Comes to an end..Raindrops have brought us together and that's what I longed to see..Open up, open up, baby let me in..Oh, these various rappers is so hilarious   Who put the mic down but y'all ain't qualified to carry this   Your, tracks are garbage and bars are miscellaneous   So, throwing your joint at my car was spontaneous   Oh!"
"The features in the setting in the story afects the cyclist in many ways. For example in the story it said, ”At same point, tumple weed crossed my path.” This is saying that he is in the desert or somewhere very hot because I know that you usually only see tumple weeds in very hot places. Thus, being in the desert affect the cyclist because he is already low on water then being  in a place as hot as the desert made him get even nor dehydrated. Another feature in the setting in this story that affected the cyclest is the hills he had to climb. This affected him because he was already  dehydrated and climbing hills made him have to work more which caused him to lose more sweat and become even more dehydrated. Those are two examples of how the features in the setting of this story affected the cyclest..[Chorus]   Here comes Santa Claus, here comes Santa Claus,   Right down Santa Claus Lane..There's a well on the hill,   You just can't kill for Jesus,   There's a well on the hill, let it be..Look out where you're going   There's danger ahead   The signal is showing   A definite red      Look out what you're doing   You're caught in a pot   Whatever she is brewing   Stay out of the pot      You better get wise, here's what I advise   When she sighs for a squeeze   Freeze, blame it on the breeze   Start to sneeze, get the measles      She'll get you off balance   Then suddenly shove duck   When she throws her hook out   Don't let your heart get took out   Pick up your pack and cook out   Oh look out, look out it's love      Look out where you're rowing   Stay close to the bank   That river is flowing   Right into a tank      Look out where you ramble   You're out on the loose   You're liable to amble   Ride into a noose      You better look out or better turn about   Like a trout   At the dam, scram, take it on the lamp   It's a jam, it's a stampede      She'll talk to her lawyer, where by and where of   She'll get the marriage book out   And she'll pick the perfect look out   Her welcome mask's been shook out   Oh look out, look out for love.Field of diamonds in the sky      Field of diamonds in the sky, like the night you pass me by..Name your price   Ticket to paradise   I can't stay here anymore   And I've looked high and low   I've been from shore to shore   If there's a shortcut, I'd have found it   But there's no easy way around it      [Chorus:]   Light of the world, shine on me   Love is the answer   Shine on us all, set us free   Love is the answer      Who knows why   Someday we all must die   We are hopeless boys and girls   And we are never heard   It's such a lonely, lonely, lonely world   People turn their heads and walk on by   Tell me is it worth just another try      [Chorus:]      Tell me, are we alive   Or just a dyin' planet   (What are the chances?).That endless season      When time was all we had      We saw forever      And caught it in our hands      Life was a charm      Our hearts were filled with music      And laughter      When time was all we had            I never will forget your face in silhouette      Your voice will be the sweetest sound      I'll ever hear and yet      We knew somehow the song would never end      When time was all we had to spend.And come to find out this niggas crossing out my motherfucking name   So what am I to do?"
"The features of the setting affected the cyclist by making him hot and thristy most of his way. As he rode he started to get tired slowly and he got work and more thirsty. He drank his water at first with out thinking to much or it, but as he went on he slowly found himselfs trying to conseve it. By the time he got to the second wild town the will he was so thirsty and tired thathe thought it might of been a ""death"" So he wiped the sweat from his eyes."" to make sure it wasn't a mirage. The only time people see mirages is when the are hot,tired, and about to kill for some water. This is what the cyclist was like after his long jouney to Yosemite National Park with the directions given by old men..Is it enough to breath?.Breaking the changing sleep of night..In my heart I still hope you will open the door   You can purify it all, answer my call.Where are those happy days   They seem so hard to find   I tried to reach for you   But you have closed your mind   Whatever happened to our love   I wish I understood   It used to be so nice   Used to be so good      So when you're near me   Darling can't you hear me   S.O.S..Beside a garden wall where stars are bright   You are in my arms..When I was a young buck   I tried to be liked by   Everyone   Everyone   I tried so hard to be funny and nice   I tried so hard to be sugar and spice   Didn't work for me   Got old quickly   But now I'm not losing sleep at night   No one's calling me on the telephone   To see if I'm at home   Cause now I've got everything that I have ever wanted or so it seems   Yeah so it seems yeah      You don't   Have to   Like me   Anymore   I've got money now   I don't care   What you say   About me   Anymore   I've got money now      When I got a little older   I realized   It's all lies   There is no prize   There is no prize   There is no heartache if you can afford   Everything delivered right to your door   Responsibilities   This life is easy   So now girl with everything   How could she complain   Cause she's got it made   Yeah she's got it made   I don't need to be tucked in at night   Told that everything is gonna be alright   Is gonna be alright   Cause I don't have to fight      You don't   Have to   Like me   Anymore   I've got money now   I don't care   What you say   About me   Anymore   I've got money now      I wouldn't trade a dollar for some sense   I wouldn't trade a lifetime for some friends   I've got everything   And all is what it seems   I worked so hard all of my life   Just to have things I could call mine   I don't need no love   Cause I have got enough   So now I don't mind being alone all the time   It's alright   I've got money now   That's what it's all about   And I'm so busy buying things and traveling the world   I don't have time for friends   Or family   And that's fine with me   So it seems      You don't   Have to   Like me   Anymore   I've got money now   I don't care   What you say   About me   Anymore   I've got money now      You don't   Have to   Like me   Anymore   I've got money now   I don't care   What you say   About me   Anymore   Cause I've got money now.So do you laugh at those who cry - Reply?"
" The features and setting in the story affected the cyclist because they made his journey to Yosemite even harder. In the story it says that it was so hot he could drop dead from heatstroke. Also his lack of water made him extreamly tired as he petaled. Next the sun was beating down so not only was he tired due to his lack of water but also because of it being so hot out he was loosing water and energy from his sweat. Thats why the features and setting made his journey to YoSemite difficult..And I pull her to me..I didn't mind at all   I didn't mind at all   I didn't mind at all      I've been woken, and I have been broken   But this time its gonna change   For, I've been lazy and I have been crazy   But this time it's not hazy at all   Cause I've been,   I've been chose my heart has been stolen   But from,   From this day on, I swear to you true..Well, you covered your tracks   And now I can't see you   You had your ashes scattered at sea   There's no grave to visit, no tombstone to look at   You were in the New York Times obituary   There's no record, no tape, no book, no movie   Some photographs and some memories   Sometimes I dial your phone number by mistake   And this is what I hear:   This is no longer a working number, baby   Please redial your call   This is no longer a working number   Your party doesn't live here anymore   This is no longer a working number   If you still require help   Stay on the line, and an operator   Will try to bail you out   I knew I should have seen you that Thursday   I knew I shouldn't have left   But you sounded so good, your spirits so up   I thought I'd see you next week   I say over and over if I had half a brain   If I had half a brain in my head   I wouldn't sit here, dialing a wrong number   And listening to what some recording said   I knew I should have written, written things down   I always say I'll never forget   Who can forget a one-eyed pilot?.Well he'll always be that Michael to me   And it doesn't matter if he's black or white   'Cause I can't stop loving him and I,   Hate plastic surgeons and I hope they all fucking   Die   How do you like that?.Gonna hit you where it hurts..Wreckin' crew!.He said I dance now at every chance and honky tonks   For drinks and tips."
"The setting affect the cyclist because in the hot heat of California in June which nobody wants to be outside. But first, was the heat which took a lot out of his body while trying to keep it cool. Then came the factor of which he had very little water when he reached the first town and in the story it said, “A tar like substance oozed out, followed by brackish water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees.” So now he has no cool water to drink when he says, “Not two miles into the next section of the ride, I noticed the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.” So the cyclist has very little water is not having to endoor the hardest part of the ride. Then later on he makes a mention to change a paragraph if he loss consciousness. Also he talked about him might getting a heatstroke. Hinting to the fact that the setting he was in was affecting him in many different ways..I can't live your way..Because I'm not to blame,   For the things that I've been doing..Then I know that you're somewhere thinking of me   Oh yes, you are   Then I know that you're somewhere thinking of me      Oh, ooh, yeah, no point regretting that it didn't last   No point regretting that it went so fast   Time that we had was like sand in our hands   But when I look behind, I'm so glad that you were mine      I remember taking you home on that 86   Standing in your doorway where we use to kiss   Then your dad came out and chased me down the street   If you remember just how scared I use to be      Then I know that you're somewhere thinking of me   I know, wherever you go   That you'll be thinking about me now   I know, wherever you go   That you'll be thinking about me      Bumped into Irene down in Waterloo   She told me that you got yourself somebody new   She said you musta like him 'cause he's, oh, so nice   But I remember that you like a pinch of spice, well I      I know, wherever you go   That you'll be thinking about me now   I know, wherever you go   That you'll be thinking about me now      I know, wherever you go   That you'll be thinking about me now   I know, wherever you go   That you'll be thinking about me now.young man!.Oh, and I'm coming to cover the muck up..This is where they all come to hunt me down, hunt me down   Where they go to hunt me down, they hunt me down      Weigh out the options   Pave the narrow   I know what you're thinking   Come on man I swear you can do this   Come on man I swear you can do this   I break free from this room they built for me   I break free from this room they built for me      This is where they all come to hunt me down, hunt me down   Where they go to hunt me down, they hunt me down      I tore out my lying eyes   So they locked me up   I tore out my lying eyes   So they locked me up   Preying on the innocent.he sure looks magic!"
"The features of the setting affected the cyclist by lack of water, poisonous snake, the condition of the rode for example the lack of water affected the cyclist because he couldn't make it wi thout water he could of passed out if he didnt have water. Another example of how the setting affected the cyclist would be the poisonous snake if he would have  goten bitten he could have died cause there would be nobody to help him. And the last example of how the setting affected him would be the conditon of the road because it make it tougher for the cyclist to get to his destination with hills and windy rounds this is how I think the setting affected  the  cyclist..And I don't want to lose you,   don't want to lose you..'Cause I've got nothing on but the radio,   And I've got nothing on for tonight..Glory, glory, hallelujah,   Glory, glory, hallelujah,   Glory, glory, hallelujah,   And he ain't gonna jump no more!.Why would I try?.My baby gimme high temperature..Summer 1988   Never though you'd graduate   Playin with your guns all day      If only they could see you now   And how you've learned to shoot so well   They wouldn't talk that way      [Chorus:]   Wayne, you know it's true   There's nothing you can do   So put those guns away   Who cares it's wrong or right   So please give up the fight   And put those guns away      All of your freinds are through   They've given up what they tried to do   See now how happy they are      Each with a new lease on life   A brand new car and a milage wife   Doo doo doo doooo doo doo....Is this the end?"
"The features of the setting affect the cyclist because he wasnt pre pared in the beginning, the cyclist got directions from an old man who hadnt left his porch in years so he wouldnt know what had changed. Then the cyclist starts his journey with not a lot of water. When he got to the second town “I notice the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short rolling hills.’ This quote means that he wasn’t expecting hills, he thought it was going o be a flat way. Also in the @NUM1 degree whether with limited water supply, he couldnt ride up and down hills. Going down the hills gave him a break. Thats how the cyclist was affected by the settings features..Pacing floors and opening doors,   Hoping you'll walk through   And save me boy,   Because I'm too crazy for you..When you hit rock bottom   You've got two ways to go   Straight up   And sideways   I have seen my share of hard times   And I letting you know   Straight up   Is my way      Things are tough all over   But I've got good news   When you get down to nothing   You've got nothing to lose   I was born naked   But I glory bound   And a dead end street   Is just a place to turn around      (Chorus)   When the sky is the limit   Up on easy street   Rock bottom   Ain't no place to be   Rock bottom   Ain't no place for me      When the law of the jungle   Is the law of the land   Good luck   Stayin alive   I keep a clinched fist under   This hat in my hand   Cause only the strong survive      Things are tough all over   But I've got good news   When you get down to nothin.I see the sword of Damocles is right above your head   They're trying a new treatment to get you out of bed   But radiation kills both bad and good   It can not differentiate   So to cure you they must kill you   The sword of Damocles hangs above your head      Now I have seen lots of peoples die   From car crashes or drugs   Last night on 33rd street, I saw a kid get hit by a bus   Bus this drawn out torture over which part of you lives   Is very hard to take   To cure you, they must kill you   The sword of Damocles above your head      That mix of morphine and Dexedrine   We use it on the street   It kills the pain and keeps you up   Your very soul to keep   But this guessing game has its own rules   The good don't always win   And might makes right   The sword of Damocles   Is hanging above your head      It seems everything's done that must be done   From over here, though things don't seem fair   But there are things that we can't know   Maybe there's something over there   Some other world that we don't know about   I know you hate that mystic shit   It's just another way of seeing   The sword of Damocles above your head.You tell a joke and forget the punchline   Why you always wastin' my time?.And me, I'll repay the favor with your favorite thing you love to do..I'm going to sing my song   And sing it all day long   A song that never ends   How can I tell you, all the things inside my head..For all I know you want me too   And maybe you just don't know what to do   Or maybe you're scared to say: ""I'm falling for you""      I wish I could get my head out of the sand   'Cause I think we'd make a good team   And you would keep my fingernails clean   But that's just a stupid dream that I won't realize   'Cause I can't even look in your eyes without shakin', and I ain't fakin'   I'll bring home the turkey if you bring home the bacon"
"In the essay, the features of the setting affect the cyclist. One feature that affects him is his lack of water:"" The water bottles contained only a few tantallizing sips. The lack of water made him very desperate, especially when he came to the welch’s grape juice factory. The  building-abandoned years earlier-had been a welch’s grape juice factory and bottling plant."" This despersion, after he had come to the abondoned factory, was followed by dissapointment and a vague sense of hopelessness expressed by the phrase, ""I hung my head"" after he had found the abondoned factory. These are some of the features of the setting that affect the cyclist..There's no goodbye,   There's no goodbye,   There's no goodbye between us..And when it comes back to some good old-fashioned love,   I've got it, I've got it, I've got it, got it, baby, 'cause....Praise the lord, praise god,   Is what you wish to sell..Your time will come   Let hot iron blow as he raised the shade      Well, there ain't no goin' back when your foot of pride come down   Ain't no goin' back.I've never been there, I might get lost at sea..I had called for the doctor,   But the doctor can't be found..As far as I can see,   There's no reason for goodbyes,   You're just running scared,   And that's something I won't buy."
"The cyclist is very discouraged by the dry and hot settings around him. A feature is something specific about some thing else. In ‘Rough Road Ahead. Do not exceed posted speed limit the cyclist takes the advice of a few old men that seems to be somewhat outdated, and gets him lost as he is running out of water and energy. The cyclist says “Over one long, crppling hill, a building came into view. I wiped the sweat from my eyes to make sure it wasn’t a mirage” (Kurmaskie @NUM1). He is greatly affected by the heat and was so tired he wanted to make sure the building was not an illusion. Also, the changed terrain affected how much water he drank and how hard he had worked just to get up that one long hill. The dry climate and tough terrain greatly affected the cyclist..Darling, I can see the clouds around you   And in your heart I know a sorrow grows   But if you weep I'll be right here to hold you   'Til each tear you cry becomes a rose      Dearest love, I know your heart been shattered   And all my words can offer no relief   But my love will heal the pain you've suffered   And I'll be here if you should turn to me      I deepest night when memories tend to gather   Lay with me and put your fears to sleep   Cause there's no pain no dream can put asunder   All the love that binds us you and me      Darling, I can see the clouds around you   And in your heart I know a sorrow grows   But if you weep I'll be right here to hold you   'Til each tear you cry becomes a rose   'Til each tear you cry becomes a rose.Drinkin' my wine, makes me feel fine   Gonna have me a holiday   Poor man's party, rich man's daughter   Gettin' hotter and hotter      She's pushin' way too hard   I don't want any part of her way   Drinkin' my wine, makes me feel fine   Gonna have me a holiday      It's a holiday....And yes it's come to this,   It's come to this,   And wasn't it a long way down,   Wasn't it a strange way down?.The clock has stopped..I just wanna dance the night the night away   Go ahead and make my day Mister DJ      Honeys if you're gay   Burn it up like a gay parade   Honeys if you're straight   Pump it up, take it all the way   Intoxicated, emancipated, unapologetic   Is what I am today   Light me up      Make the night go on and on and on   You know we go on and on and on   Make the night go on and on and on   I'm living up my life until the day I die   Don't need a lullaby      Music got me sweating hard I feel my heart   Thumping like an 808 uh huh OK   If you wanna mess with us   Sink you with a counter-punch      Honeys if you're gay   Burn it up like a gay parade   Honeys if you're straight   Pump it up, take it all the way   Intoxicated, emancipated, unapologetic   Is what I am today   Light me up      Make the night go on and on and on   You know we go on and on and on   Make the night go on and on and on   I'm living up my life until the day I die   Don't need a lullaby.Somewhere over the rainbow, Skies are blue..My Jesus stands to help"
"In the essay “Do Not Exceed Speed Limit,” the features of the setting affected the cyclist in a few ways. One way it affected him was that the temperature was very hot and by it being hot outside his water wouldn’t stay cool. This is a problem because you need nice, cool, refreashing water to stay hydrated. Another way was when he hit a fork in the road. He didn’t know which way to go. All he saw was one ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that couldn’t hold the lamest mule greeted me. The sight was troubling. Last but not least this water pump wasn’t working very well so he got down on his hands and knees and started pumping. The water wouldn’t cool down. He tried a drop or two and the water tasted like battery acid. Those are some features of the setting that affected the cyclist on his journey..I think this brain has thought a lot,   Oh, searching, trying to find the crutch,   I think these ears hear a whole lot of music,   And like me they've heard a bit too much..Diana:   Didn't I see this movie,   With Mcmurphy and the nurse?.Well I woke up this morning woah-oh   And the sun refused to shine   I knew I'd leave my baby oh   With a troublin' mind   It rains every morning oh   And evening is the same   And it's gonna be a long time oh   'Til I hear the 2:10 train      Well I looked out my window oh   And I couldn't keep from cryin'   I knew the old 2:10 oh   Would take me down the line   That driver on that engine oh   Well he ain't no friend of mine   He's taken all the women oh   And he's left the men behind      Well now he won't be leaving Big Ben oh   For another seven years   I'm gonna find another baby oh   To laugh away my tears   When I get back to Houston woah-oh   I'm gonna shout and tell   How the Big Ben bought 'em oh   It's a living burning hell      Now when your lovin' baby leaves you oh   Don't you feel so bad   It makes you think about the good times oh   With the one time man you've had   He's crying don't leave me here baby   Shackled to a chain   But let me ride down with you oh   Along the 2:10 train.I try to love you, baby..""Oh Man!"".Yes, I'm ready to die, (No!).So what that Lench Mob like?"
"Features of the setting that affect the cyclist are “the cool pines and rushing rivers” they affect the cyclist by keeping him cool and energized by the senery and the temperature, another is the juice factory and it was old and shut down showing that he would die alone.

"The cyclist in Rough Road Ahead: Do not Exceed the Posted Speed Limit was greatly affected by the setting. There were no buildings or people to the town anywhere. This emptiness meant that there was no help from anyone and he could die with out anyone knowing. Also the setting seems to be very dry and have desert like conditions, without water the cyclist would be dehydrated and could suffer from a heat stroke. Also the setting seems to be very hot. The heartt also makes the cyclist physically dehydrated and mentally considers the logic of a heat stroke at the time..I cut your wood so easy for you,   You can't help but say, ""Hot Dog!"".Instead the order came to shift..Hellalujah   ""Give God the first portion of your income, say that with me,   Give God the first portion of your income..Bend down, I command you   Turn your face away from me   Your face means nothing to me   Bend down      A human on all fours   I take him on a walk   Ambling along the corridor   I am disappointed      Now he comes backwards towards me   Honey stays stuck on the garter   I am disappointed, totally disappointed      Bend down....It's your favorite son..You little fairy,   Smelling all your flowers..Where is the love, where is the love,   Where is the love that's on your mind?"
"The features of the setting affect the cyclist’s mood throughout the essay. Joe @CAPS1 starts with being happy and confident to determined yet help helpless and then to relief. Joe writes, “Things began well enough… flat roads…” This quote suggests that in the beginning, everything was okay. He started out with a “smile on the face.” (@NUM1) @CAPS2, things start to change @CAPS1 hits changing terrain. He writes, “…I noticed the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short rolling hills.” This quote states the changing terrain. He starts to lose water to keep him going, yet he pushes himself to the next “town”. Finally, when the author reaches “Gary & Wilber’s fish camp” he is relived when he sees an old guy sitting. The two men say, “know The best way to get There? “Yes sir! I own a very good map.” This reveals that Joe didn t ask for more directions which was his first mistake. In addition, changes in setting can chang a persons mood and attitude..Well, I bet you think I'm petulant, but I'd never lie to you..I miss my baby..Will you decide what makes you an entity   That's your identity   Well if you don't know   Which way to go      You might be lost and confused   A second chance no time to lose      Regeneration of your cyber sonic soul   Transforming time and space beyond control   Rise up and resist to be the master of your fate   Don't look back before today- tomorrow is too late      You don't want to be a robot ghost   Occupied inside a human host   Analyzed and cloned relentlessly   Synthesized until they set you free      Alright-okay, alright   Till they set you free   Alright-okay   Till they set you free      I don't want to see you, yeah   I don't want to see you, yeah.You know who I am.Have you ever known a boy, lonely as could be?.I n-I never Run to be D   With another MC   I got what I want   Right in front of me..But you beady eyed buzzard stay away from my gal   Or else it's gonna be ."
"The features of the setting affect the cyclist because the rougher the terrain got the more the cyclist had to strain to make it. For example, when the terrain turned to hills, the cyclist had to struggle to climb the hills which caused him to use more of his energy. Also, if the terrain was flat and smooth, the cyclist had less problems making the long journey. For instance, if the cyclist had less strain on him then he would not be as tired and would not drink as much water. In conclusion, that is how the features of the setting affect the cyclist..Long distance information   Give me Memphis, Tennessee   Try to find the party   Trying to get in touch with me   She would not leave her number   But I know who placed the call   Cos my uncle took the message   And he wrote it on the wall      Help me, information   Get in touch with my Marie   She's the only one who'd phone me here   From Memphis, Tennessee   Her home is on the south side   Just beyond the ridge   Just a half a mile   From the Mississippi Bridge      Help me, information   More than that I cannot add   Only that I miss her   And all the fun we had   We were pulled apart   Because her mom would not agree   Help me get in touch with her   In Memphis, Tennessee      The last time I saw Marie   She was waving me goodbye   With hurry homedrops on her cheek   That trickled from her eyes   Marie is only six years old   Information please   Help me get in touch with her   In Memphis, Tennessee.Oh, I'm lovin', lovin', lovin', lovin', lovin', lovin', lovin', you   Oh, and it's easy (easy)..I watched you get down on your knees,   In hopes that I would turn around..Guess God thinks I'm Abel..You know they're just like you and me..Everytime you go away, I feel you've gone away to stay   I sit on down and feel so scared baby, scared baby, scared baby   Everytime you run around, I think about another town   I think about moving, making some running repairs..I'm sitting on 2 heads      "" some seat"" I heard some said      Just waiting for sunday      Four days after wednesday      The higher clouds are closing in      To hide the deeds of fertile jim      Could this be a brand new low      One that we can't talk about      One that we can't live without      One that we can join in now      I'm standing on 2 feet      Now buried in concrete      Just waiting for sundown      So as to be not found      The higher clouds..."
"The environment around people in certain situations can affect them in many ways. For instance if  you are hot, tree could be shade, or thirsty, a river neer by could help your thirst. If you were hungry and hot, but nothing was near you this could make you hot. In this cyclist case the environment affected him in many ways, from bumpy roads, “ghost towns, and trees. For example he said, “The sun was beginning to beat down, but I barley noticed,” this is because of the ""cool pines"" around him as he explains in the next paragraph. It also says in the text that the terrain changed and he even came upon a snake, which added to his thirst. So then making it harder for him to go one. From reading the the text on can see how features can have effects on a person..I   Owe you an apology too many thanks and that's not all..Feel no shame - 'cause time's no chain   Feel no shame.If her loving don't get me,   I know her husband will..You know I love,   The thirll of the rush..With a little luck this ol' truck will get me home today   With a little more I'll still have this job tomorrow   Weather man says a wet weekend he just might be right   But rain or shine you'll be mine tonight      That's all I need to know   In a world where most things come and go   I'll always have you to hold   And that's all I need to know      Heaven knows I ain't even close to bein' God's gift to women   But in your arms I feel like I am   I don't know it all, I sure can't solve   The problems of the human race   But I know how to bring a smile to your face      That's all I need to know   In a world where most things come and go   I'll always have you to hold   And that's all I need to know      Darlin', say it one more time   You will forever be mine      That's all I need to know   In a world where most things come and go   I'll always have you to hold   And that's all I need to know   I'll always have you to hold   That's all I need to know.Take a breath and I try to draw from my spirits well..Ain't that lovin' you, baby?"
"The cyclist ran into rough settings on the way to @ORGANIZATION1 park. The first is the town he came to was a ghost town. Then he was running out of water when he ran by tambleweeds, and a large snake in front of him. He had no more water and there was rough roads ahead of him and he came across a juice factory. No one was there and he was out of water he did not know how longer it would be until he came tp another town. That is why I say that how the features of the setting affected the cyclist..It's been too many years inside this prison   Too many years just for one little fight   He got what was comin'   And I think I served enough time   I'm goin' home tonight      That stone looks mighty cold   And the guard that walks that wall   Is just waitin' to get a convict in his sights   But if I can clear the top   You can bet I'll never stop   Cause I'm goin' home tonight      Because stone walls do a prison   Make iron bars a cage   Any man who says they don't   Never been inside   Cause in time the bars get closer   And at night the walls grow tighter   Do you feel like there's a shackle around your mind?.Do ya thang, man   Fuck what they lookin' at!.Diddley, diddley, diddley, diddley daddy..Ahh   So what if I came knocking?.Winter in the city The year is running dry New Year's resolutions   So perfect in mind Gonna lose this blue addiction of mine Me,   I work long hours First to come and last to go   I walk by Christmas windows Full of things I'll never own Things      I cannot give you My fortune's set in stone      [Chorus]   How beautiful the falling snow It hushes all the world And heals a melancholy heart   How beautiful, how beautiful The candle in the window It dances and it swirls   How beautiful the snow tonight How beautiful the world How beautiful, beautiful      Da da da da's For some, the table's laden Others are denied Makes my love run deeper   When I see how hard you try And just like you, the snow falls Silent in the night      [Chorus].Anyone who sees her, soon forgets the Mona Lisa      It would take I know, a Michelangelo   And he would need the glow of dawn that paints the sky above   To try and paint a portrait of my love      It would take I know, a Michelangelo   And he would need the glow of dawn that paints the sky above,   To try and paint a portrait of my love.."
"The features of the setting effect the cyclist by teasing him. First it was the rippling streams that taunted his thirst, then the old faucet and last the welches grape factory. The strraing were the beginning stage simply provoking thirst then came the faucet. The faucet made him relise that he was dehydrated. And last the abandoned welches grape juice factory had him almost abandon hope. The setting was effecting his mood..Look at me!.I need you oh so bad..And when you think,   The whole wide world has passed you by..My baby taught me how to be   My baby taught me how to fight   My baby taught me how to die   Alcohol, alcohol, alcohol, alcohol!.Saw a snail chase a whale, all around the water pail..Oh boatman, taker and giver,   Can you deliver me?.So, tell me, baby,   Where did I go wrong      Everything I had was yours,   More than I have ever given before,   So, won't you tell me   Did I hurt you so bad      I guess I'm fooling myself,   'Cause I want you and no one else."
" The features of the setting affects the cyclist. Because the man didn’t have a lot of water and he was go into the California deserts in June. Another reason is because the flat road was changed into rolling hills and up ahead there was a sign that said “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit.” the speed limit was @NUM1. One more thing is make sure you don’t listen to a gentleman that is old and hadn’t be off ther porch in decades. That is some of the things that can affect the cyclist..In love...Ah ha ha ha...   ...follows torture...follows reward... (2x)   Oh, oh my butt...   Never shook Satan's hand, look see for yourself   You'd know it if I had, that shit don't come off   I'll rise and fall, let me take credit for both   Jump off a cliff, don't need your help so back off   I'll never suck Satan's dick...   Again, you'd see it, you know, right round the lips   I'll wait for an angel, but I won't hold my breath   'Magine they're busy, think I'm doing okay....Who did, you did, you   Who did, you did, you   You say who did, well you did, it's you.Waters all over these pages..Don't forget it!.Cause your my fire....I got an out of town pistol with the graveyard frame..Always and forever   Each moment with you   Is just like a dream to me   That somehow came true, yeah      And I know tomorrow   Will still be the same   'cause we got a life of love   That won't ever change and      Everyday love me your own special way   Melt all my heart away with a smile   Take time to tell me you really care   And we'll share tomorrow together   Ooh baby, I'll always love you forever      Ever, ever, ever   There'll always be sunshine   When I look at you   It's something I can't explain   Just the things that you do   If you get lonely   Call me and take   A second to give to me   That magic you make and      Everyday love me your own special way   Melt all my heart away with a smile   Take time to tell me you really care   And we'll share tomorrow together   Ooh baby, I'll always love you forever"
"In the short story “Do not exeed the speed limit” by Joe Kurmaskie, the setting has great impact on the cyclist. In the begining of the story he describes the scenery as ""@CAPS1"". As he continued following the old mens out dated advice. It lead  him through more barren lands. When he came to the first ""town"" he described it as a ghost town. The second setting he arrived at was “One romshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that couldnt hold in the lamest muic” he continued moving to the next town, which was @NUM1 away, he came to what he thought was a Welch's Grape juice factory and bootling plant. This tools a toll on his confidence because he said ""I hung my head"" he moved on and had finally arrived at un abandoned buiding called ""@PERSON2 and wilbers’s fish camp. ""This is where he drunk water and became repleshed. The setting had a great effect on the cyclist. Because depending on the location, decided weather he would live or die in the hot deserts of California..I've got my pistols in my pockets boys   I'm Alabama bound   I've got my pistols in my pockets boys, I'm   I'm Alabama bound   Well, I'm not looking for no trouble   But nobody dogs me 'round      Well, I'm going to fetch my woman, people   Tri-cities here I come   Well, I'm going to fetch my woman, people   Tri-cities here I come   'Cause she was raised up on that cornbread   And I know that woman give me some      When the kid hits Alabama, people   Don't you try to dog him 'round   When the kid hits Alabama, people   Don't you try to dog him 'round   'Cause if you people cause me trouble   Lord, I got to put you in the ground      Well, I was born in Mississippi   And I don't take any stuff from you   Well, I was born in Mississippi   And I don't take any stuff from you   And if I hit you on your head   Boy, its got to make it black and blue      Well, I'm goin' to Alabama   Got my pistols out by my side   Well, I'm ridin' to Alabama   With my pistols out by my side   'Cause down in Alabama you can run   But you sure can't hide.You know what you did, all to blame is you   Now the least I deserve is no conversation   I been working all week   I'd rather be your enemy   Than any friend you think I would be      [Hook].And those were the days of roses,   Poetry and prose and Martha   All I had was you and all you had was me..These little people were good to me,   Oh I'm gonna shake some hands."".I know something that you don't know   Something that you ought to know   It's burning a hole in my pocket book   Listen ... do you want to know a secret?.Well, if I had my way tomorrow or today,   Babe, I'd run circles all around..Chorus   And on, and on, oh yeah   Chorus   Before everything goes wrong   We got a little time   And now I can't seem to define   I'll sing you one more song"
"The features of the setting affect the cyclist for many readers after another. @CAPS1 are some examples why the cyclist was bike riding down a windy road. He is in a hot place similar to a desert. It is very hot there and is affecting him during his travels,""I eased past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state. Another thing that affected him because of the setting was that the desert had rocky roads and windy paths because he followed the old mans direction. ""Rough Road Ahead"" are final example is that he was in the desert so he saw a snake come out of the tumbleweeds."" A large snake it really did look like a diamond back."" @CAPS1 are three examples how the cyclist had been affected due to the setting of the story.   .Must be nice riding on that motorcycle after school, huh?"".He's foolish, unworldly and yet appealing I like him..Lay your head on my chest so you hear every beat of my heart   Now there's nothing at all that can keep us apart   Touch my lips, close your eyes and see with your fingertips   Things that you do, and you know I'm crazy 'bout you      Kisses of fire, burning, burning   I'm at the point of no returning   Kisses of fire, sweet devotions   Caught in a landslide of emotions   I've had my share of love affairs and they were nothing compared to this   Oh, I'm riding higher than the sky and there is fire in every kiss   Kisses of fire   Kisses of fire      When you sleep by my side I feel safe and I know I belong   Still it's making me scared that my love is so strong   Losing you It's a nightmare, babe, and to me it's new   Never before did you see me begging for more      Kisses of fire, burning, burning   I'm at the point of no returning   Kisses of fire, sweet devotions   Caught in a landslide of emotions   I've had my share of love affairs but they were nothing compared to this   Oh, I'm riding higher than the sky and there is fire in every kiss   Kisses of fire   Kisses of fire      Kisses of fire, burning, burning   I'm at the point of no returning   Kisses of fire, sweet devotions   Caught in a land-slide of emotions   Kisses of fire, burning, burning   (I'm at the point of no returning)   Kisses of fire, sweet devotions   I'm riding higher than the sky and there is fire in every kiss   (Caught in a land-slide of emotions)   Kisses of fire, burning, burning   I'm at the point of no returning   Kisses of fire, sweet devotions   Caught in a land-slide of emotions.Somewhere in London   In the middle of nowhere   Didn't have nothing to do that day   Didn't wanna do nothing anyway      You got a way of walking   You got a way of talking   And there's something about you   And now I know I never ever   Want to be without you      [Chorus]   I want to be haunted by the ghost   I want to be haunted by the ghost   I want to be haunted by the ghost   I want to be haunted by the ghost   Of your precious love   Of your precious love      The first time I saw you,   Standing in the street   You were so cool,   You could have put out Vietnam   My girlfriends ask me, ""What's he like?"".La, la la la la la landing..You may be in a big city or drivin' down a country lane, yeah   Workin' two jobs to make a livin'   And all you do is complain, well   You should be thankful of what you got   Yes, you should be thankful of all you got   Wakin' up in the mornin', seein' the sun rise   (Well, well)   Is enough to say, ""I thank you, Lord""   Rollin' over, seein' my baby's eyes, uh   Is enough to say, ""I thank you, Lord""   I just wanna say thank you   (Thank you)   Thank you, thank you, thank you, Lord   (Thank you)   (Thank you)   Thank you   (Thank you)   Thank you   (Thank you)   Thank you, Lord   Be thankful of what you got   (You know you should)   Be thankful of all you got   You may live in the valley, you may live on the highest hill   Some people say, you don't do nothin' but take the doctor's pills   You may be in a nursery, in a classroom   Drivin' your big fine car, hup   Airplanes, uh, take you, uh far   Layin' out in the sun, uh, or just workin' on the run   Hoo, you should be thankful of what you got   I know you should be thankful, oh, yeah, of all you got   (Well, well)   Yeah, ooh, oh   (Be thankful)   We need to be thankful of what you got   Of everything we got   (Be thankful)   We need to be more thankful   (Of all you got)   Of everything you got   (Be thankful)   Thank you, thank you, thank you   (Of all you got)   Thank you for all I got   (Be thankful)   Thank you.What an odd situation   What you got is basic emotions   Can you feel them   I want to be your lover   But you're so shy   What you need is perfect assistance   Let me guide you   To a land you're never seen before      I guess you see   I have another daydream   I guess you see   That I have another daydream      Come and be a dancer   Dance into my daydream   Join me in my daydream wet and wild      Come and be a dancer   Dance into my daydream   Join me in my jungle wet and wild      To help another person   Will make you feel important   You got my invitation   But you're so shy   Come and let your wild side show   And be a dancer   A dancer in a daydream we can share      I guess you see      Help me take control   Of my full imagination   I'm looking for a man   Who will watch my situation   I'm thinking about the people   Waiting down the line   I am the limelight now's my time      I guess you see      What you gonna do I'm a bold explosion"
"The cyclist ran into many issues in his/her travel to @LOCATION1. They had to dismiss many hardships such as lack of water, being lost, immense desert heat, plus minor things like snakes and road conditions. The setting of the California desert in June was the most intense hardship. That and the lack of water. Though the heat starting powing at the cyclists’ brain by making them see mirages, etc. The heat and entire setting made the cyclists’ travel much harder..Words of Life, words of Hope   Give us strength, help me cope   In this world, where e'er we roam   Ancient words will guide us Home..Took time to see through all the glitter   That you made..Gonna save you fucker,.not gonna lose you   Feeling cocky and strong, can't let you go,   Too important to me      Too important to us, we'd be lost without you   Baby, let yourself fall, I'm right below you now      And fuck me if I say something you don't want to hear   And fuck if you only hear what you want to hear   Fuck me if I care, but I'm not leaving here      You helped me when I was down, I'll help when you're down   Why are you hitting yourself, c'mon hit me instead      Let's pick up your will, it's grown fat and lazy   I'm sympathetic as well, don't go on me now      And I'm not living this life without you, I'm selfist and clear   And you're not leaving here without me, I don't want to be without   My best friend, wake up to see you could have it all      Cause there is but you, and something within you   It's taken control, let's beat it, get up let's go      Oh you're in your own world, let's see the whole world   Let's pick up your soul      And fuck me if I say something you don't want to hear   And fuck me if you only hear the treble in your head   Please help, me, to help you, help yourself      Help me help yourself, please want me to, please let me to      Help you.Twenty-five minutes past quiting time   Seven of us crammed into that truck of mine   Payin' no attention to them highway signs   Ninety mile an hour toward the county line      Quick sack, twelve pack, back again   It's a B - double E - double are - you - N      My buddies and their babies lettin' down their hair   As long as we're together it don't matter where   Ain't got a lot of money but we just don't care   Knowing that the fun is in the gettin' there      Aztec, long necks, paycheck spent   Oh it's a B - double E - double are - you - N      I can't stop thinkin' what the Hell they were drinkin'   When they made this county dry   I got a week long thirst and to make it worse   Lord it's my turn to drive      Oh, laughin' and a braggin' and a carryin' on   We loaded up the wagons and we're headin' home   I guess half a dozen cases doesn't last that long   Come tomorrow morning it'll be all gone      And it's turn around, leave town, sounds again   Like a B - double E - double are - you - N   Like a B - double E - double are - you - N.I....

"The setting in the story “Do not exceed posted speed limit” reflect upon the cyclist. In the story a cyclist is riding his bike and takes directions from some old men. Later he realizes the old men probably had no idea that things change overtime. He says “Never accept travel advice from a collection of old-timers who haven’t left their porches since carter was in office.”(Kurmaskie @NUM1). The cyclist takes the old-timers “shortcut” and it takes forever to reach his destination. At the end he reaches his campsite and another person askes him for directions. This time the cyclist says “Yes, sir! I own a very good map,” and “I’d always stick to it in the future.” The cyclist’s message is to follow a map, something you know is right, not a person that @MONTH1 be lying or irresponsible..There are worse ways of getting there   And I ain't complainin' none..The Shepherds amazed was   How it should come to pass   That Christ our Messias   Should be our King!.That Elvis is alive and well   That courtesy has gone to Hell   That kindness is in short supply   That little kids should have to die..(timmy tappan, don roth)      Smile's not a smile until it wrinkles your face   Bell's not a bell without ringing   A home's not a home when there's nobody there   A song's not a song without singing      Chorus:   Love isn't love till you give it away   Love isn't love till it's free   The love in your heart   Wasn't put there to stay   Oh love isn't love till you give it away      You might think love is a treasure to keep   Feeling to cherish and hold   But love is a treasure for people to share   You keep it by letting it go      Repeat chorus      Cause love can't survive   When it's hidden inside   And love was meant to be shared      Repeat chorus.Is there something holding you back?.I said ""I'd rather get off here."".In between my sheets,   In between the rights and the wrongs."
"this story is set in the hot in the hot desert in June and the character is a cyclist trying to get to a National Park. the setting affects the cyclist because the hotter it is the more water you need to keep you hydrated, but the man is alone in the desert. This quote “about forty miles in the pedal I arrived as my first “town”. The place might have been a thriving little syos as one time”. This quote shows how deserted the desert is and how as he rides there is nobody around no where to re-hydrate no where to get drecionsn he was alone..What's my name?.I can do anything..My heart goes BBB   Every time I think of you   Heart's going BBB   Lost control what shall I do?.Say your prayer for the ones that we love,   Say your prayer for the ones that we love..I don't believe what I'm hearin'   You can't impress me by what you show me   Don't think I'm goin' through changes   Or you might see me change for the last time      Having a bad day   Better deal with it   If you're playin' games   No time for it   If you're bringin' pain   Gonna run from it   Don't mess up my day      I'm the only one who's responsible   For me havin' fun   And you can't take my      [Chorus:]   Happiness is what my life's about   Happiness no I can't do without   Happiness nothing can stop me now   Through ups and downs I'm still happy      Life is good as I make it   I can't sit while you make it for me   I like those jewels you gave me   But I want to buy some jewels for myself   To lose the ball and chain   Gotta reach for it   To realize my dreams   Gotta reach for it   Nothin' comes for free   Gotta reach for it   No I'm not gonna have to depend on you      I'm the only one   Who's responsible   For me havin' fun   And you can't my      [Chorus]      I'm the only one   Who's responsible   For me havin' fun   And you can't my      [Chorus: x2]      Happiness   Happiness.[Verse 1: YG]   I go hard, no limit on my card   Digested in your solar system, you hangin' with some stars   Dick all in her jaws, the stash worth pack at   I mix tequila with the yak, I'm so abstract   Aw shit, I just had a flash back   Of me runnin' in your shit like ""where the cash at?"".Cabron   Tiki tiki tiki tiki,   Waddup Holmes?"
"Heat, abandoned roads, snakes all are reasons that affected the cyclist. The heat made him get dehydrated faster while he was using energy. The long abandoned roads further increased his doubt of living the whole bike ride. He used up allof his water. So when he got to the old pump hot dirty water came out. The snake in the story made the journey for this guy perilous and deadly. This all happened because he listened to the old guys. When the other old guy was about to tell him whereto go he said no..Now you've been kept   Out of the garden   I have wandered from shore to shore   Don't you find that there's no more   Pacem in terres me shanti shalom aywah      Don't you wish   Love alone   Don't you wish   Love   Don't you wish   Love alone   Don't you wish   Love   Don't you wish love alone   Could save the world from disaster   Is only love, inner confusion   Is it just one more illusion   And I said   Pacem in terres me shanti shalom aywah      Well, if you want to have great love   You've got to have great anger   Well, if you want to have great love   You've got to have great anger   When I see innocent folks shot down   Should I just shake my head and frown   Oh Pacem in terres me shanti shalom aywah      Girl if you want to hit the target square   You've gotta look out (for it not happening there)?.World goes round, life goes on, and on, and on..Do I stay with you, do I move along..Does she need me, as she pretends   Is this a game, well then will I win   It's a lover's question, I'd like to know      I'd like to know when she's not with me   If she's still true to me   I'd like to know when we're kissing   Does she feel just how I feel,   And how am I to know it's really real..I want to be your hunger   I want to see you open wide   And when I go down for you   I want to blow your mind      It's   So good of you   To love you      You and I   Such a pretty thing   Smile, smile   You know you thrill me   Cross your heart, and hope to die   You know I'd love to..it hurts..Well, bless my soul, what's wrong with me?"
"When the cyclist began his journey he was confident in succeeding. Throughout the story however, the cyclist endures many conflicts to his successs in his journey. The cyclist faced his first difificulty once he reached a small, abandoned town. “I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly, and I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June” (kurmaskie @NUM1). The cyclist realized he had not conserved his water and his “water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips” (kurmaskie @NUM1). On top of his water problem the heat was unbelievable. He was losing hydration from all the sweat, and he was losing it quickly. The cyclist was also dealing with the difficult roads. There were many things this cyclist endured through-out his journey, but he was determined to finish his trip and was filled with satisfaction once he overcame these hardships..Forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those that trespass against us      Although them again we will never never never trust      Hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo!.La da da da da da da da da (Whoa...)

"In the story “Do not Exceed Posted Speed limit” the cyclist sees many different settings when he left it was early summer and it was pretty hot outside. He rode into the morning when would make him tired. The first town he reaches upon was a ghost town so that means he could rest get his supplies. Then he arrive by cool pines and rushing river which probably makes him feel releaxed. Then he showed up at a ramshack shed with several rusty pumps and a carrol that couldn’t hold in the lamest made. Gated men which people made him feel uncocleible, and the pumps did not give him water so that was nobody also pointing. Then he was rideing through the California deserts in June witch probably made him more dehirrated..I've got my eye on you      The taxi driver looks to me and says ""Where to?"".Healing rain is coming down   It's coming nearer to this old town..I play in a band, yeah, we're called the Red Hots   While I'm away, boy, I'm afraid not   I've got no time to flick and talk   But this baby rocked out on the spot   She was a shakin' and a kickin' and that did a bit of tot   Her pop said no, but I just couldn't stop   The killer had a case of tod the rock      But here's a funky fact that I know is real,   The Red Hots have baby appeal   They dig a funky spiel, they'll make some spiel   I say the Peppers have baby appeal   The funk mobile is the one we wheel   I'm overjoyed, we have baby appeal   We serve those tots in the funk mobile   I'm overjoyed, we have baby appeal      We stop the fire, we quench the heat   We groove the buttocks walking out in the street   'cos that's when in the store when who do we meet?.Oh god, I'm lonely..We can tell, Dolly!.And cry..Oodles of light what a beautiful sight   Both of God's eyes are shining tonight   Rays and beams of incredible dreams   And I am a quiet man."
"The cyclist should have never taken the advice from the older men. The map would have been a lot safer and easier. People seem to always look for a shortcut, including myself. He could have died from heat stroke and lack of water. He did have perseverance though he never gave up and that is what saved him. Being in that situation and setting I would have given up..Conrad the Caterpillar thought he was really killer,   Couldn't wait to build a cocoon (original lyrics)   Couldn't wait to buy blue suede shoes (recent lyrics)   Spent all his days eatin' leaves in the shade   And stayed when the night set, too..Say what they may, all of my friends were there..For I must have you or no one   And so I'm through with love..It's not too late, I'm still right here..maybe, not to mention a sedative   Heard one guy say ""why even let it live?"".I wish the day would come soon,   To get away from another full moon..My generation."
"The conditions and features of the setting caused the cyclist to be tired and dehydrated and think that he was going to die from it. For example, it says “and ther growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke on a georgus day in June”. Also , he thinks he is getting dehydrated when he says “I  was doing a water depleting 12 mph. sometimes life could be so creul”. in conclusion, this cyclist started this without enough water causing him to think that he was going to die from either heatstroke or dehydration..Beer run!.You know I'd adore it with...   Dance with me!.Get it on, bang a gong, get it on..Psychedelic Shack, that's where it's at..Though the years may grow colder as people grow older,   It's shoulder to shoulder we'll be!.You can watch Mr. Rogers   You can watch Three's Company   And you can turn on Fame or The Newlywed Game   Or The Addams Family      I say, you can watch Barney Miller   And you can watch your MTV   And you can watch 'till your eyes fall out of your head   That'll be OK with me      And you can watch (TV)      You can watch Johnny Carson   You can watch Phil Donahue   And you can use TV Guide to help you decide   With capsulized review      Say, you can watch 60 Minutes   Even Captain Kangaroo   But there's only one set, so what ever you watch   Well, you know I gotta watch it too      Say, give it up, give it up, television's taking its toll   That's enough, that's enough, gimme the remote control   I been nice, I been good, please don't do this to me   Turn it off, turn it off, I don't want to have to see      The Brady Bunch   Not The Brady Bunch   Well, The Brady Bunch   Yeah, The Brady Bunch      It's the story of a lovely lady   Who was bringing up three very lovely girls   All of them had hair of gold, like their mother   The youngest one in curls      It's a story of a man named Brady   Who was busy with three boys of his own   They were four men living all together   Yeah, but they were all alone      Until the one day, one day when the lady met the fellow   And they knew, and they knew it was much more than a hunch   Then they knew this group must somehow form a family   That's the way, that's the way, that's the way they all became      The Brady Bunch   Well, The Brady Bunch   Yeah, The Brady Bunch   Well, The Brady Bunch   Oh, it's The Brady Bunch   It's The Brady Bunch   Oh, The Brady Bunch, yeah   Oh, The Brady Bunch   It's The Brady Bunch   Well, it's The Brady Bunch   Well, it's The Brady Bunch   Well, it's The Brady Bunch   It's The Brady Bunch.Gonna teach you love at the midnight hour,   Gonna feel you burning, little passion flower."
"Due to the features in the setting, including the hot summer weather, the cyclist not knowing the area, and the California desert the cyclist is affected. In the short story “Do not exceed posted speed limit” by Joe Kurmaskie the cyclist is travelling through the hot desert in June when he realizes hes running out of water, “I had been hitting my water bottles pretty reguarly and I was travelling through the high deserts of California in June”(Kurmaskie). This is affecting the cyclist because hes becoming hot and has a low supply of water. Also the cyclist realizes he should have never taken the direction from the old men and thinks to himself, “…The growing realization that I could drop from heat stroke on a gorgeous day in June”(Kurmaskie). This quote proves that the heat of the desert is taking a toll on him..She's a little lighthouse when she   Opens up her huge eyes   And streams of diamonds shoot out   'Til we're wading waist deep in her brilliant love      She's a little lighthouse when she   Opens up her red mouth   And gold word ribbons rope and rodeo   The dark clouds in bouquet above      For how long will this dark age last?.I'm nearing the end   Or the beginning   Whichever one finds me   And I'm counting the tears   And the blessings   That I'll leave behind me      I could not ask for more   You were the one thing worth livin' for      [Chorus]   I will remember days in Avalon   I will remember nights in your arms   I will remember days in Avalon   And I will recall every moment   Of my days in the sun      As I embrace the twilight   The memories surround me   I would have been lost   Sure as the rain comes   If you hadn't found me      Each breath I breathe is for you   I never knew how to live 'til you taught me to      [Chorus]   I will run through the door   I'm not afraid anymore   And the light that I see is your eyes   Once again I'll be whole   I will live in your soul   Longer than the rest of our lives      [Chorus].[Verse 2]   Babe, my broken pieces, you pick them up   Don't leave me hanging, hanging come give me some   When I'm without you, I'm so insecure   You are the one thing, one thing I'm living for      [Pre-Chorus]   I don't wanna be needing your love   I just wanna be deep in your love   And it's killing me when you're away   Oh baby   Cause I really don't care where you are   I just wanna be there where you are   And I gotta get one little taste      [Chorus]   Sugar, yes please   Would you come and put it down on me?.Sugar in your tea?.The little girl she said to me   What are these things that I can see   Each night when I come home from school   And mama calls me in for tea      Oh every night a baby dies   And every night a mama cries   What makes those men do what they do   To make that person black and blue      Grandpa says their happy now   They sit with God in paradise   With angels' wings and still somehow   It makes me feel like ice      Tell me there's a heaven   Tell me that it's true   Tell me there's a reason   Why I'm seeing what I do      Tell me there's a heaven   Where all those people go   Tell me they're all happy now   Papa tell me that it's so      So do I tell her that it's true   That there's a place for me and you   Where hungry children smile and say   We wouldn't have no other way      That every painful crack of bones   Is a step along the way   Every wrong done is a game plan   To that great and joyful day      And I'm looking at the father and the son   And I'm looking at the mother and the daughter   And I'm watching them in tears of pain   And I'm watching them suffer      Don't tell that little girl   Tell me   Tell me there's a heaven   Tell me that it's true   Tell me there's a reason   Why I'm seeing what I do      Tell me there's a heaven   Where all those people go   Tell me they're all happy now   Papa tell me that it's so.I'm free and ready so we can go steady   How's about savin' all your time for me?.Yep   Do she got a beauty mark on her left side of her mouth   Man?"
"In the essay, “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” by Joe Kurmaskie, the setting affects him negatively because he was on his bicycle and he was in a hot area and no water whatsoever, like  in this quote, “I  got down on my hands and knees, working the handle of the rusted water pump with all my strength. A tar like substance ozzed out.” In the quote, the cyclist finally thinks he has found a water pump but he really gets nothing. Also, another negative thing is that he thought he was never going  to get to where he was going, but in the end , he got there and he got some water..The radio says they are just deportees..If she can cook chicken, yeah, she'll suit me to a T.      And she don't have to wave her hair   Or even wear fancy clothes, I wouldn't even care..I should have known you'd bid me farewell   There's a lesson to be learned from this and I've learned it very well   Now I know you're not the only starfish in the sea   If I never hear your name again, it's all the same to me      And I think it's gonna be all right   Yeah, the worst is over now   The morning sun is shining like a red rubber ball      You never care for secrets I confide   To you, I'm just an ornament, something for your pride   Always running, never caring, that's the life you live   Stolen minutes of your time were all you had to give      And I think it's gonna be all right   Yeah, the worst is over now   The morning sun is shining like a red rubber ball      The story's in the past with nothing to recall   I've got my life to live, and I don't need you at all   The roller coaster ride we took is nearly at an end   I bought my tickets with my tears, that's all I'm gonna spend      And I think it's gonna be all right   Yeah, the worst is over now   The morning sun is shining like a red rubber ball      And I think it's gonna be all right   Yeah, the worst is over now   The morning sun is shining like a red rubber ball   It's bouncing and it's shining like a red rubber ball.Straight off bought me a through train ticket, right across Mississippi clean   And I was on the midnight flyer out of Birmingham   Smoking into New Orleans..Anxiety, anxiety keeps me happy..Who wouldn't do anything   That you want them to   Carry the world right to your feet   If that's what you want me to do   Didn't we laugh   And scream and shout   Didn't we wait   Til it all worked out      I know it's late   And I should wait until the morning comes   But I got a fear that wakes me up   And I don't know where the fear comes from      Didn't I bring you   What I could bring   Didn't I tell you   Everything   Well I will   Well I will      Some people talk about us   Said we'd never get this far   Let it all rain around us   You know the way things are      Fifteen miles from hope   Another town another week goes by   I'm fading away here like the birds   That disappear into the sky      Wouldn't I be there   When you call   I pick you up   When you start to fall      Well I will   Well I will   Well I will   Well I will.Is it you and me play it to one, make history   A history      Said yeah, oh yeah   Said yeah, oh yeah   I said yeah, oh yeah"
"The setting of the essay greatly affected the cyclist. These settings discourage him, although he tries to keep hope. Seeing dry desert, hills begin to heighten, nothing man-made is in sight. These subconsciously affect the cyclist and his growth of thirst. To one point the cyclists original objective became invalidated for his thirst pangs and exhaustion..The sun goes down and you come around with evening   Saying that you love ah but I know   That it really isn't tenderness you're feelin'   You're here cause you've got no place else to go   You'll ask how I've been doin' and you'll smile that same old smile   You'll touch my cheek and turn the lights down low   We'll kiss and I'll forget for just a while   That you're here cause you've got no place else to go   Ah no place else to go and no place else to be   No one else to take you in but good old easy me   When morning comes I tell myself I'll never   Do this again but deep iseide I know   I'm here because I'm bound to you forever   And you're here cause you've got no place else to go   [ fiddle -

"In the essay “Rough Road Ahead ;Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” by Joe Kurmaskie he goes through all kinds of settings where the going could get better or worse. “I noticed the terrain changing, flat roads was replaced with short rolling @NUM1 Kurmaskie). This shows or explains that the going could get a little tougher now because he will have to be riding up hills and he is almost out of water. “There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind” (@NUM2 Kurmaskie). This explains that the man could not get water or a ride from anywhere around, because there was nothing out there to at. This is how the setting features affected the cyclists..I got the blues right there, mean and low   I'm as low as the heels of my alligator shoes   You should know how it feels to have these millionaire blues   Millionaire blues      Well, I found one of my bathrooms and I made it to the sink   I called one of my managers up and I poured myself a drink   Oh, I swear I'd kill that little weasel if I could   Checked myself in the mirror, my hair was looking good, but      I had the blues right there, mean and mean and mean and low   As low as the heels on my alligator shoes   You should know how it feels to have these millionaire blues   Millionaire blues   Get down!.Tell me baby, tell me where you're bound..I hear Jerusalem bells are ringing   Roman Cavalry choirs are singing   Be my Chris and I'll be your Gwyneth   My missionaries hiding in foreign trenches      For some reason that I can't explain   I know Yves Saint Laraunt no he won't call my name   Never an h-h-h-h-honest word   But that was when I ruled the world      Now I'm doing my very best not to mess up all the words but,   A strong apology to Coldplay, but I think otherwise it's a good job      Oh, oh oh-oh oh, oh oh-oh oh,   Oh oh-oh oh, oh oh-oh, oh-oh oh,   Oh oh-oh oh,      I hear Jerusalem bells are ringing   Roman Cavalry choirs are singing   Be my Chris and I'll be your Gwyneth   The Fame won't change us if we don't let it      For some reason I can't explain   I know Saint Mary won't call my name   Never an h-honest word   But that was when I ruled the world, ruled the world,   Ru-you-u-uled the world..Tomorrow comes creepin'..Who will buy?.Hey!.What goes up must go down   World goes around   Sun shines around   Faster than sound."
"In the setting there are no cars and no buildings meaning no help. The cyclist is tired and dehydrated because he ran out of water. No one was around because it was the desert. The cyclist was dehydrated but kept going to his destination. The road was straight but almost to the end there were many hills. Along with having to bike up the hills he almost ran into a snake. The weather was hot he had no water, he could have died..All you see are endless skies   Like an ocean lit by fireflies   With a long deep breath   I speak my heart   Saying things   I'm not sure just what they are   A feeling catches me by surprise   You can see forever   In a lover's eyes   I can stop myself   But on I go   Finding feelings   I have never known   There's hope beyond   Your wildest dreams   And the feeling   Is nothing to extreme   In a flash   Tomorrow begins to rise   You can see forever   In a lover's eyes   I can see your world   Beautiful and new   And although I'm not sure   Where it's leading to   We will travel on   Our fate unknown   And for once   I know I'm not alone   It's a trade we make   A sacrifice   Love never ending   Is surely worth the price   If we survive   Love holds no greater price   You can see forever   In a lover's eyes.And now you don't know who you really are..I love to see the cottonwood blossom   In the early spring   I love to see the message of love   That the bluebird brings      But when I see you walkin' with him   Down along the strand   I wish I were blind   When I see you with your man      I love to see your hair shining   In the long summer's light   I love to watch the stars fill the sky   On a summer night      The music plays you take his hand   I watch how you touch him as you start to dance   And I wish I were blind   When I see you with your man      We struggle here but all our love's in vain   And these eyes that once filled me with your beauty   Now fill me with pain   And the light that once entered here   Is banished from me   And this darkness is all baby that my heart sees      And though the world is filled   With the grace and beauty of God's hand   Oh I wish I were blind   When I see you with your man.Christmas shoppers glance at us and smile   'Cause the mistletoe is occupied   And the dream is to share   This Christmas cheer with you all year   And not wait till the morning   When Christmas time is in the air again..It was at sundown..Maybe just a good night's sleep   Would have changed your troubled mind   From that rather permanent decision   So tragic, so unkind   Now, pain is what you've given   And sleep is what you'll get   So far away from that sweet baby child   Who hardly knew you yet      Now he'll grow up to be a fighter   Full of anger, full of shame   Like all the other haunted children   Who wonder why they came   And he'll be in and out of trouble   Until he stands up or he falls   But there will always be a shadow there   No matter how it goes   Damn it, Rose      Is this another cryptic message   Or some kind of cosmic quiz   If there's a lesson to be learned from this   Well, I don't know what it is      You could have given us the finger   Much more constructively than that   Now I sit here with the MTV   And your bloated, Burmese cat   We're being treated to the wisdom   Of some puffed up little fart   Doing exactly what I used to do   Pretensions to anarchy and art   He speaks the language of a warrior   He mounts his misinformed attack   He wears the clothes of a dissenter   But there's a logo on his back   And it's a hollow rebellion   As rebellions mostly are   It's just another raging tempest in a jar      And the seasons keep on changing   And the wind blows hot and cold   Wish that you were here with us to watch this tide   As it ebbs and flows   Damn it, Rose.When you walked in the room, I thought I'd forgotten you   Turns out it isn't true after all   And now I do regret all the things I said   I can't take this anymore      I want you   I'm telling you   Oh, oh      C'mon c'mon, I know I was wrong   Throw my hands up and take the blame   I still believe in you and me   Do you feel the same   I'm sitting there waitin' for you, and baby I can't ignore you   I just adore you, and I can't get you outta my head   C'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon   Ooooooo      I'll do overtime, just to make you mine   I can't remember why I left you behind   Things that I shoulda done, I was having too much fun   Why did I let you go?"
" The setting in this story is very hard for the cyclist. His main problem is the lack of water. If you deprive the body of water all of your major organs will bake in the hot sun. Another problem was the condition of the terrain. It is very hard to cycle on bumpy dry land. These are any a few problems the cyclist encountered..Written in dust, tainted by memories..Well, I'm a thinkin' and thinkin', till there's nothin' I ain't thunk..She must be dead   Well she must be dead   She must be dead   If the only sound I hear   Are the devils by her bed   (""aw"" ...

"The feature of the setting greatly affect the cyclist in “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit.” The features in the story changed the speaker’s mood throughout his journey. For example, in the beginning he came across a deserted town so he was cautious. Next, he came across a fork in the road which was troubling to him. Then he passed a snake and had the obstacles of the hills which made him become determined. Finally, his determination changed to relief where he reached Gary and Wilber’s fish camp. In conclusion, the setting in the story greatly affects the cyclist by changing his moods and attitude towards his journey..It won't be easy, it won't be hard   To find the reason, to find the rhyme   To get your feet back on the ground   To get your feet back on the ground      We'll be going home   Where the passion finds the perfect love   Finds the perfect love   Finds the perfect love      We'll be going home   Where the passion covers me with love   Covers me with love   Covers me with love      It won't be out there, it can't be far   Falls like a teardrop to the star   A wall of silence all around   A wall of silence all around      We'll be going home   Where the passion finds the perfect love   Finds the perfect love   Finds the perfect love      We'll be going home   Where the passion covers me with love   Covers me with love   Covers me with love      The miracle of love blinds me with your charms   The miracle of love, take me in your arms      We'll be going home   Where the passion finds the perfect love   Finds the perfect love   Finds the perfect love      We'll be going home   Where the passion covers me with love   Covers me with love   Covers me with love.(clarke)   Lucy you're a floozy   You ain't choosy   You've been flashing those big blue eyes   At the other guys   Don't be surprised   If you don't end up with a   Baby cool it, don't over do it   Always have something left as your standby   Lucy baby keep me in mind   You're so reckless   A diamond necklace   Ain't no substitute for how you feel   Such a steal   Lucy baby let's make it real   Red light outa sight is what you're saying   You don't really think that's true   No help needed you're displaying   Lucy baby, lucy baby, lucy baby, keep me in mind   As the queen bee I'll make your honey   I'll even populate your hive   I've got a sting that ain't so funny   Lucy baby, lucy baby, lucy baby, keep me in mind   Can I try you   Let me buy you   Just a piece of my delight   For the night   You'll find it alright   Lucy baby keep me in mind   Lucy baby, lucy baby, lucy baby, keep me in mind   Lucy baby, lucy baby, lucy baby, keep me in mind   Lucy baby, lucy baby, lucy baby, keep me in mind   Lucy baby, lucy baby, lucy baby, keep me in mind.Thought you were chasing a destiny calling   You only earned what we gave you..[Chorus:]   Keep on runnin', keep on hidin'   Keep on runnin' away   It's okay, it's alright   It's okay, it's alright   And if it makes you want to jump and shout, go ahead!.I can't excuse it on the grounds of youth,   I was no babe in the wild, wild wood..Hey where you goin' Blackeye ?.New York, to that tall skyline I come, flyin' in from London to your door   New York, lookin' down on Central Park   Where they say you should not wander after dark      New York, like a scene from all those movies   But you're real enough to me, but there's a heart   A heart that lives in New York      A heart in New York, a rose on the street   I write my song to that city heartbeat   A heart in New York, love in her eye, an open door and a friend for the night      New York, you got money on your mind   And my words won't make a dime's worth a difference, so here's to you New York"
"The setting in “Do Not @CAPS1 Posted speed limits” affects the mood of the cyclist in that every time the setting changes the mood of the cyclist changes. In the begining of the story the cyclist is riding through the “cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite.” @CAPS2 this time the cyclist is enjoying his trip and is in a positive mood. As the story goes on “there was no one in sight, not a building, a car, or structure of any land.” At this point in the story the cyclist has exchanged his positive mood for a desperate one as his water begins to run out..Hey!.All around me I need you..Sometimes at night I dream, he's still that hairy man,   Shadow boxing the apocalypse, wandering the land..Baby, how can we make love if we can't make amends?.I said, how could they know?.Paradise waits   On the crest of a wave   Her angels in flame   She has no pain   Like a child, she is pure   She is not to blame      Poised for flight   Wings spread bright   Spring from night   Into the sun   Don't stop to run   She can fly like a lie   She cannot be outdone      Tell me the cost   I can pay   Let me go   Tell me love is not lost   Sell everything   Without love, day to day,   Insanity is king      I will pay   Day by day   Anyway   Lock, bolt and key   Crippled but free   I was blind   All the time   I was learning to see      Help on the way   I know only this   I've got you today   Don't fly away   'Cause I love what I love   And I want it that way      I will stay   One more day   Like I say   Honey, it's you   Without love in the dream   It will never come true.?"
"Poisonous snakes, mirages, rolling hills, and dry dead tumbleweed these features in the setting that the cyclist was going through have the greatest effect of all. They showed the trecherous path he took the obstacles he had to surpass the prevail. The purpose of including some features of the setting like the poisonous snakes, mirages, rolling hills, no signs of life, and no water all show and impact how bad the conditions were. If it left out these sectives the audience could say/think he was traveling through any old trail, for all they know the cyclist could be traveling along a windy river passing threw nice developed towns, so you see the features in the setting help set the mood and also reveal the confident of the story..When I am Queen,   Dilly dilly,   You'll be my King..Ah!.Come on and hit me!.Want to watch that bullet lay 'em down..Remember when   Never needed each other   The best of friends   Like sister and brother   We understood   We'd never be alone      Those days are gone   Now I want you so much   The night is long   And I need your touch   Don't know what to say   Never meant to feel this way   Don't want to be   Alone tonight      [Chorus]   What can I do to make you mine?.Uh-oh, uh-oh, uh,   Uh-oh, uh-oh..I can't remember."
"The features of the setting affect the cyclist because if is very hot and is summertime. The cyclist wouldn’t have gotten so tired and exhausted if he wasn’t in a “ghost town”, with the, “sun beggining to beat down”. It was in @CAPS1 for nia during June so it was. Very hot, the water was also @NUM1 degrees! The text as states there were rolling hills and tumble weeds, so it must have been a desert kind of area. The trip was also a very long one, “about forty miles into the petal”, causing him to be tired. As you can see the setting was an area with no people, and it was very hot..If I believe in magic spells,   It all would be so clear:   A magic spell must have brought you here..Famines will be famines, banquets will be banquets   Some spend winter in a palace, some spend it in blankets   Don't wag your fingers at them and turn to walk away   Don't shoot someone tomorrow that you can shoot today      Time to end the praying   Listen what they're saying      Get up off your knees   You can wag your finger till your finger's sore   Shake your head till it shakes no more      Paupers will be paupers, bankers will be bankers   Some own pennies in a jar, some own oil tankers   What may sound like tomorrow could be ours today   There's no more need for sorrow if we get off our knees to pray      Time to end the praying   Listen what they're saying      Get up off your knees   You can wag your finger till your finger's sore   Shake your head till it shakes no more      Countries will be countries, borders will be borders   Some have lost their folks at war, some have give orders   Don't wag your fingers at them and turn to walk away   Don't shoot someone tomorrow that you can shoot today      Time to end the praying   Listen what they're saying.[Intro]   Nigga, G-Unit Nigga!!.How do the roots become tangled?.Don't be denied, don't be denied..The planet could be a better place   If we spot the miss   But I guess I would see a start   I will sing it loud   Won't you put your feet back on the ground?.The drunken politician leaps   Upon the street where mothers weep   And the saviors who are fast asleep,   They wait for you."
"The features of the setting affect the cyclist because as the terrain got rougher things to the cyclist got harder. In paragraph @NUM1; there is a senteance that says, “It read: Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit.” In the next paragraph the cyclist comments, “sometimes life can feel so cruel.” @CAPS1 because the road ahead got rough to the cyclist life was cruel. All the features like the snake, lack of water and rolling hills are all obsticules in life, people have to experience. We might not like it but the reward at the end is wonderful..Dad threw up on Christmas Day   He puked on the serving tray   The stuffing's come right out of Daddy dear   Now everybody's Christmas vacation   Will be filled with a viral infection   Maybe we'll all be better by next year   We felt more than a breeze   When Daddy had to sneeze   It didn't sound a lot like Ah-Choo   Mom was saying grace   When Daddy barked on her face   So Mom asked God to bless the vomit too   Dad threw up on Christmas Day   He got some chunks on Uncle Ray   Who kept on talking about his pancreas   We'll all remember Christmas Eve   As the last time we were free of disease   And able to digest some solid food.Wah, wah, wah, la, la   Coolest pharoah by far!.The man who preached the funeral said it really was a simple way to die   He laid down to rest one afternoon and never opened up his eyes   They hired me and Fred and Joe to dig the grave and carry up some chairs   It took us seven hours and I guess we must have drunk a case of beer      I guess I oughta go and watch 'em put him down but I don't own the suit   And anyway when they start talkin' bout the fire and hell well I get spooked   So I'll just sit here in my truck and act like I don't know him when they pass   And anyway when they're all through I've got to go to work and mow the grass      Well here they come and who's that ridin' in that big ole shiny limousine   Hm look at all that chrome I do believe that that's the sharpest thing I've seen   That must belong to his great uncle someone said he owned a big ole farm   When they get parked I'll mosey down and look it over that won't do no harm      Well that must be the widow in the car and would you take a look at that   That sure is a pretty dress you know some women do look good in black   He's not even in the ground and they say his track is up for sale   They say she took it pretty hard but you can't tell too much behind a veil      Now listen ain't that pretty when the bugler plays the military taps   I think that when you's in the war they always hired and played a song like that   Well here I am and there they go and I guess you'd call it my bad luck   I hope he'll rest in peace but trouble is that fellow owed me forty bucks.Turning and returning to   Some secert place inside watching   In slow motion as you turn around   And say      [Chours: Both]   Take my breath away   Take my breath away      [Both]   Through the hour glass   I saw you in time you slipped away   When the mirrior crashed I called to you   And say      [Kelly]   If only for today I'am unfraid      Repeat Chours      [Kelly]   Ohh you take my breath away kalan..It was all about the pussy, if you can get it..Ah yeah!.Are you lonesome without me?"
"The setting desented in the story, “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Speed Limit,” would be a nightmare for any biker. This biker is riding in the middle of a desert on a summer’s day. The sweat dropping down him is just speeding up his dehydration. This is shown when the narration states, “wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that i could drop from heatstroke” (Kurmaskie). This show how hot the desert was, and how he could drop dead. The desert is also deserted with rolling tumbleweeds and giant snakes, as he passed abandoned towns and factories. The dangerousness for a biker in this area is very high. The biker was lucky to have made it out of those sorroundings alive..Mina saiko arigato, k-k-k-kawaii   K-k-k-kawaii..Hate..When will we be married Molly   When will we be wed   When will we be bedded in the same bed      When will we be married Molly   When will we be wed   When will we be bedded in the same bed      You have your eye on Jimmy   Long Jimmy Lee   You have your eye on Jimmy   And a fine man he      You have your eye on Jimmy   But you'd better let him be   Because when you go, Molly-O   You'll be gone with me      When will we be married Molly   When will we be wed   When will we be bedded in the same bed      When will we be married Molly   When will we be wed   When will we be bedded in the same bed      You have your eye on Johnny   Thin Johnny Fee   You have your eye on Johnny   And a fine man he      You have your eye on Johnny   But you'd better let him be   'Cause when you go, Molly-O   You'll be gone with me      When will we be married Molly?.I'm really thinkin' brains   But on the other hand, I really feel your stress and pain..You're weighed down with regret   You can't see the road ahead   Or the burden on your back   It seems the trek will never end   The winding paths that still descend   And up above a sky washed black   You just can't bear to look at that      [Chorus]   Follow the signs   Open your eyes   Read between the lines of what you see   Look into the soul of reality   Open your mind   Look at the signs   Never look back at yesterday   Keep your gaze steady on the narrow way      Now you've found the sacred tree   You kneel upon the broken wheat   You watch your burden fall away   And all the things that you once sought   Now are counted less than lost   For now you see the light of day   The signs were pointing all the way      [Chorus]      Follow the signs   Open your eyes   Look at the signs   Open your mind   Follow the signs      [Chorus].And then when he can't go on   He plants his nose in the sky And he wipes it up above   And he splits like I cry for an unfaithful love..You're a grand old flag,   You're a high flying flag   And forever in peace may you wave."
"The features of the setting affects the cyclist in many ways. First of all, if the cyclist didn’t listen to the old man, he would have never gone through this trouble. Also being that he didn’t have enough water when he went on riding, caused him to be real dehydrated. He should of turned back as soon as he ran out of water. Plus the heat made him real hot and thirsty. He should know how to never trust any strangers and try things on his own..You're going through a tight wind..And I wonder still I wonder who'll stop the rain..Today we are goin' real hard (Yeah yeah!).The early cars   Already are   Drawing deep breaths past my door   And last night's phrases   Sick with lack of basis   Are still writhing on my floor      And it doesn't seem fair   That your wicked words should work   In holding me down   No, it doesn't seem right      To take information   Given at close range   For the gag   And the bind   And the ammunition round      Conversation once colored by esteem   Became dialogue as a diagram of a play for pun   Took a vacation, my palate got clean   Now I could taste your agenda   While you're spitting your cud      And it doesn't make sense   I should fall for the kingcraft of a meritless crown   No, it doesn't seem right   To take information      Given at close range   For the gag   And the bind   And the ammunition round      This is not about love   'Cause I am not in love   In fact I can't stop falling out      This is not about love   'Cause I am not in love   In fact I can't stop falling out   I miss that stupid ache      What is this posture   I have to stare at   That's what he said when I'm sittin' up straight   Change the name of the game 'cause he lost      And he knew he was wrong but he knew it too late   But I'm not being fair   'Cause I chose to listen to that filthy mouth   But I'd like to choose right      Take all the things that I've said that he stole   Put 'em in a sack   Swing 'em over my shoulder   Turn on my heels      Step out of this sight   Try to live in a lovelier life (lie?).Oh how God comes, as he starts the great judgment of fire,      So he can gain, his greatest desire..Go will i   Over yonder   I will see my mother   And my sister   And my father   Oh but my brother is going to hell      Well they hung him   From the gallow   As the sun turned   Red from yellow   And the crowd they   Heard him haughty   And they sighed   With much relief      The preacher asked him   For any last words   My brother spit on   Onto his clean shirt   Oh and he smiled   Without redemption   Said this is one soul   God dont need      Well now I loved him   I will miss him   As hes burning   And twisting   For his heart with   Dedication   To the devil   And his creed      Well as a child we   Wed call him rotten   Tell him he was lonely   And forgotten   And he revenged our   Constant cheering   Oh with his every   Word and deed      Oh yeah and for my   Contribution   To his souls lack   Of retribution   Oh well I ask the   Lords forgiveness   On my very bended knee.Buildings with a hundred floors."
"The features of the setting affect the cyclist greatly. At first it was flat road which the speaker was happy with and he had “a smile on.” (@NUM1). Then came large rolling hills which created a challenge, the cyclist needed to muster up enough energy to continue. The rough terrain was next causing the cyclist to work even harder to cycle. As if the rough terrain wasn’t energy soaking enough, a snake blocked a majority of pavement and large elevations came into play. The harder the terrain, the harder for the cyclist..Oh!.Now I can't believe its true   And I don't know what to do   For the hundredth time   I check the declination      Now the fear starts to grow   Even my computer shows   There are no errors in the calculations      Now it's happened take no other view   Collision course, you must believe it's true   Now there's nothing left that we can do      When Two Worlds collide   The anger and the pain   Of all those who remain   Two worlds collide   Who will be left alive   No place to hide      When Two Worlds Collide   The anger, the pain   Of those who remain   When two worlds collide   When two worlds collide   So who will survive   There's No place to hide   When Two Worlds collide.I'm a consecrated boy   Singer in a Sunday choir   My mama loves, she loves me   She gets down on her knees and hugs me   She loves me like a rock   She rocks me like the rock of ages   And she loves me      When I was grown to be a man   And the Devil would call my name   I'd say ""now who do   Who do you think you're fooling?""....Dee die, dee di-de-di-de-di-de-di-de-di-de-di-de-di..If I can't get away from you   What am I gonna do   Cause you hit me just like a dream   Where there's no in-between   Cause I just fall forever   Fall forever in your eyes      Cause it's a mad mad love   Mad mad love   Mad mad love   Can't help falling now   Falling into mad love      Well you're shorting out all my pride   Like fireworks exploding inside   You're just something I can't deny   Why tell me baby why   Cause I just fall forever   Fall forever in your eyes      Cause it's a mad mad love   Mad mad love   Mad mad love   Can't help falling now   Falling into mad love      If I can't get away from you   What am I gonna do   Now you call me up and you're so cool   What d'ya what do you want me to do      Cause it's a mad mad love   Mad mad love   Mad mad love   I can't help it   Mad mad love   Mad mad love   Mad mad love   Can't help falling now   Falling into mad love.(hanh!)"
"“@CAPS1 directions, June, lack of water” all are elements that effect the rider on his ride. He took directions from older people who promised the rider a short cut. I turned out that their short cut was wrong. When the rider went on this trip, it was June in California. It would have been burning hot. Lastly he had drank most of his water during the trip. He could have died if he didn’t find the other water source. These were some elements that effected the rider on his trip..What a dance do they do..There's some food upon the table, boys   And if you have ever seen me flying   Then you know that I am weak   And you are free to take me downstairs   Away from cares   I'll be with you in the morning, boys   Cause you know that if we wait for our time   We'll all be dead      Oh now I'll bore you, crying my life away   Don't I know it, always the things I say   Always too far   If you could be anything that you want to be,   do you think that you would be who you see in the mirror?.You're right, and I'm left all alone..Which old Witch?.All the lonely people, where do they all belong?.Hot!).Isn't it romantic?"
"Durring the cyclist @CAPS1 he was affected by the setting frequently. When he was cycling it be came very hott to him but at first it wasn’t so bad. “The sun was begining to beat dow, but I barely Noticed it.” This proves that the cyclist knows it was getting hot but it did not affect him. Another thing that affected him was the time that he was travling in. “I had been hitting my water bottles pritty regularly and I was travling through the high dezerts in califonia in June.” This proves that the reader was constantly drinking because of the time of day and year he was out.

" The features of the setting affect the cyclist in a couple different ways. When the cyclist found the gohst town since no one was there he could not ask someone for better directions or get some food or water. The short rolling hills make it harder to pedal because it is hard to pedal uphill. At the end of the story he found a bait shop where he got water and better direction's..I love what you wear, isn't it too tight?.Who'll be the next in line for heartache?.Hey yeah whatdya want!.There is no other name, given among men whereby they might be saved..If you're a man, you'll stop delaying and betraying   Try to act like you were mack   You can't go an hour without that sex attack   What's wrong, boy, is it that good?.I used to chase the moment of desire   Back to when my young heart burned like a fire..You and I, we are simple things."
" There are numerous features in the setting that effect the cycleist. For example  the rough road. A nother example is the tumble weed and the snake also affected the cyclist.

"The features of the setting affect the cyclist, in the story Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit, in many ways. The cyclist is affected because the setting is depressing and frightening. When the cyclist first sees the speed limit sign of 55 mph, he says, “Sometimes life can be so cruel”. Because he can only go 12 mph considering he's on a bike. After seeing the sign, a snake crosses his path. He’s frightened by it because it looked like a diamond back and he was trying to keep his balance and ease past it. Since the main problem the cyclist is faced with is the lack of water, the dry, long hills seem to make him more weak and tired. Tumble weeds crossed past him and there was no water in sight That is how the features of the setting affect the cyclist..It's such a selfish way to lose   The way you lose these wasted blues,   These wasted blues..Little stranger in a manger little stranger sweet and mild   Mother Mary daddy Joseph watch o'er you their holy child   Searching for you to adore you come Three Kings led by a star   Little stranger in a manger they'll find heaven where you are   Choir of angels are singing this night of your birth   Praise and glory to the highest in a stable on earth   Humble shepherds filled will wonder kneel and pray by lanthern light   Little stranger in a manger bless our soul this holy night   Choir of angels are singing this night of your birth   Praise and glory to the highest little stranger here on earth   Humble shepherds filled will wonder...

"In the story, the cyclist starts out with a lot of confidence that he can complete the whole ride. But after he left first town he had been riding and needed water, so he stoped at a fork in the road he had just to;to get water from a pump which tastes like battery acid. Then as he progressed further in his trip he came to a sign that said “Rough Road Ahead: Do not exceed speed limit”(Joe Kurmaskie pg @NUM1) This part of his trip made it very challenging by making him face rough roads and mountains that he had to cross which sucked the water out of him. Then as  he came over the last mountain, he saw a sign for a gart store. So when he arrived he got some water and got directions for a man who had the best map. So you can see that going over an the mountains, sucks all the water out of the cyclist, so he was so relieved when he got the water at the end..save the bass      [Chorus]   Why do you think they call it dope?.So we're a little bit older now..When you know how I need you   To beat to a pulp on a Saturday night   Ooooh babe, don't leave me now..I want be man   I want be man   I want be man   I want be man      I don't like living inside   This metal plastic shell   It's no way to treat your help   They'll tell you go to hell      I want be man   I want be man   I want be man   I want be man      Faster master   I've got better things which I can do   Hey I don't like livin' in this fleshy human shell   As much as I abuse it, it's really gone to hell      I want be man   I want be man   I want be man   I want be man      I'd rather be a robot   So I don't have to think   'cause then I could be programmed   Where I don't have to dream   I'd rather be a man   Instead of a machine   Flesh and blood life and death   It's a mystery   Nothing to be programmed   Nothing is for sure   And least there's a reason   A reason for my life   I want be man   You want be me      I want to live in your body (hey).See me sitting in the palm tree   Looking down at people passing by   Sitting here no-one can harm me   They just stare at me and wonder why   No need to bother, I'm gonna stay up here   Whatever happens, I won't let no-one near   Until you tell me, Jeanie Jeanie on my mind, won't you please   You really love me, Jeanie Jeanie you're so fine, yes you are now   And in the evening, when the sun goes down   I'll be the bluest of men in this town   'Cause I love you, Jeanie Jeanie on my mind      See me sitting in the palm tree   Waiting for those little words from you   People laugh and point their fingers   Like I was a monkey at the zoo   But I will stay here, among my coconuts   So you will know dear, you're everything I've got   Now won't you tell me, Jeanie Jeanie on my mind      Winds blow, stars glow, I see a light in a window   Dark trees, soft breeze, carry my message to her please      See me sitting in the palm tree   Feeling angry at the silly crowd   No-one else but you can calm me   You should know by now I'm far too proud   I need to show you, I've got my feelings too   You shouldn't treat me like you always do   So won't you tell me, Jeanie Jeanie on my mind, won't you please   You really love me, Jeanie Jeanie you're so fine, yes you are now   And in the evening, when the sun goes down   I'll be the bluest of men in this town   'Cause I love you, Jeanie Jeanie on my mind      Jeanie Jeanie you're so fine   Jeanie Jeanie on my mind   Jeanie Jeanie you're so fine   Jeanie Jeanie on my mind   Jeanie Jeanie you're so fine.It's alright..This information is yours for free."
"The features of the setting have a major affect on the cyclist. It is a very hot day and he is in a desert in California with a limited water supply. It starts becoming very hot, and his water supply begins to decrease quickly. The old men who he says “have not left their porch since @PERSON1 was in office” gave him very wrong directions to Yosemite and he ended up getting lost out in a hot California desert. He eventually came to a fishing store where he refreshed with alot o f water from the sink, and then was off again on his way to Yosemite..God, where have I been..I waited years sometimes for what I wanted..That sounds alright in a careless rhyme   But there's seldom a second time      Better luck next time   That could never be   Because there ain't gonna be no next time   For me, no sirree      Made up my mind   To make another start   I've made my mind up but I can't make up   My heart      I'd like a new lucky day   That would be nice   But this comes just once in a lifetime   Not twice      So don't say better luck next time   That can never be   Because there ain't gonna be no next time   For me..fuck you America!.And you know just what to   Do..She's moving like: Oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh   She's moving like: Oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh   She's moving like: Oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh,   Oh oh, oh oh, oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh   She's moving like      Can be my daddy   I feel ecstatic   Don't worry we can   Make love automatic   Come feel my body   I think you're naughty   With you and I now   The party get started      I think I like you   I think I like you   I think I like you      She's moving like: Oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh   She's moving like: Oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh   She's moving like: Oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh,   Oh oh, oh oh, oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh   She's moving like   I am the club rocker   I am the club rocker   I am the club rocker      Can be my daddy   I feel ecstatic   Don't worry we can   Make love automatic   Come feel my body   I think you're naughty   With you and I now   The party get started      I think I like you   I think I like you   I think I like you      She's moving like: Oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh   She's moving like: Oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh   She's moving like: Oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh,   Oh oh, oh oh, oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh   She's moving like      I am the club rocker   I am the club rocker      That's the way that I feel every day, every day   That's the way that I live every night, every night      She's moving like: Oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh   She's moving like: Oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh   She's moving like: Oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh,   Oh oh, oh oh, oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh   She's moving like.I'm just bored, nothing's ever gonna be the same   Anymore."

"The features of the setting made the cyclist’s ride longer and harder than he expected. When the cyclist first headed out the road was flat and smooth. Halfway through his trip the “Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.” The cyclist continues to pedel even though he was slowed down to 12 mph. The hills made the ride slower and harder because of the hills. Tuoards the end of the hills he had to make it “Over on long, crippling hill”. The word “crippling“ is used to show the phisical affect that the hill had on him. The hills were a feature of the setting which made the cyclist’s ride longer, harder, and more phisically demanding..Coltrane (repeat)   Round and round we'll chase   Like a silver train   Focused in a storm   Comin' through the rain   Avalanche of notes   Ships of crystal clear   On this earth they fall   But nobody seems to hear   Coltrane (repeat)   Round and round we'll chase   Like a silver train   Focused in a storm   Comin' through the rain   Avalanche of notes   Ships of crystal clear   On this earth they fall   But nobody seems to hear   When I dream I fly   Through this stormy world   Ships of sound I ride   Far from pain and fear   To Coltrane's sound so clear   Coltrane.(repeat)   I need you..When the feeling isn't right?.Those gunshots echoed through the town..Oh!.All of a sudden, now baby, it's real..She pulls the shade   It's just another sunny Sunday   She dodges the light like Blanche DuBois   Bright colors fade away on such a sunny Sunday,   She waits for the night to fall   Then she points a pistol through the door   And she aims at the streetlight   While the freeway hisses   Dogs bark as the gun falls to the floor   The streetlight's still burning,   She always misses   But the day she hits   That's the day she'll leave   That one little victory, that's all she needs!"

"In this essay features of the setting affect the cyclist in his journey to get to Yosemite makes it worse. Firts for example the cyclist was in the high deserts of California in the heat of June. Which makes it bad because of the heat makes it harder on the cyclist. Also being in the deserts there wasn’t any watwer supply so after the cyclist ran out of water it got worse because he got dyhigerated, and caused him to become weaker and not pedal as fast. Also the author says that the tarren changes from flat roads, to short rolling hills, which also made it more difficult because the short hills made it more work, and since it was so hot and he didn’t have water he couldn’t funcation as well as if he was hydrated..Oh!.I hate you!.I'll send a letter to that girl   Asking her to be my own   But my pen is writing wrong   So I'll say it in a song   Oh, I love you more right now   More than I've ever loved before   Here's those words straight from these lips   I'll need you forever more      [Chorus: x2]      Come ease the pain that's in my heart [Repeats]      Late last night I had a dream   And she was in it again   She and I were in the sky   Flying hand in hand   I woke up in a cold sweat   Wishing she was by my side   Praying that she'll dry tears   Left on my face I've cried      [Chorus: x2]      Come ease the pain that's in my heart [Repeats].Rock your body come on everybody   Somebody stop me   When I dance I'm losing control   You see me yo this is stereo   I wanna hear my song one time on the radio      I'm gonna do this step by step do it anyway got to feel your loving   I'm gonna break even the law of the gravity to see you in the morning      Let me see your body move on the floor like ten minutes ago   Shake shake shake your body   Move on the floor like ten minutes ago   Winning in every place 'cause your my lucky ace   DJ turn off the bass   Winning in every place 'cause your my lucky ace   Everybody do it on the floor      I'm gonna do this step by step do it anyway got to feel your loving   I'm gonna break even the law of gravity to see you in the morning      Let me see your body move on the floor like ten minutes ago   Shake shake shake your body   Move on the floor like ten minutes ago   Winning in every place 'cause your my lucky ace   DJ turn off the bass   Winning in every place 'cause your my lucky ace   Everybody do it on the floor      Rock your body come on everybody   Somebody stop me   When I dance I'm losing control   You see me yo   This is stereo   I wanna hear my song one time on the radio      I'm gonna do this step by step do it anyway got to feel your loving   I'm gonna break even the law of gravity to see you in the morning      Let me see your body move on the floor like ten minutes ago   Shake shake shake your body   Move on the floor like ten minutes ago   Winning in every place 'cause your my lucky ace   DJ turn off the bass   Winning in every place 'cause your my lucky ace   Everybody do it on the floor.YOU BROKE YOUR OWN HEART   WRITERS HANK WILLIAMS, HANK WILLIAMS JR.

"The many features of the setting affected the cyclist in many different ways. The beauty of nature around him affected him by making him laugh. In the essay, it says, “ on a gorgeous day in June caused him to laugh.” This shows, despite what happened, he was might are on a nice day outside giving him an optimistic attitude. Also, the beating sun affected him in a different way. It caused him to sweat and almost die of dehydration. “ growing realization that l could drop from heatstroke ” This shows that he was tensely aware that he could die from the suns might.

"In the essay “Rough Road Ahead Do Not Exceed posted Speed Limit.” The feautures of the of the area the cyclists rides through affect him greatly. For example when the narration says, “At some point, humble weeds crossed my path” (Kurmaskie @NUM1). The tone of the cyclists from the quote above shows despare creeping into his mind. Also, another good example is when the narration says, “@CAPS1 hill, a building came into view” (Kurmaskie @NUM1). The cyclist sounds more hopfull than before. That is how the area the cyclist enters affects him..My heart turned over and I crawled in..Shot goes out tuh brian e, shot out tuh photo will..I'm so happy 'cause today   I have found my friends   They're in my head   I'm so ugly, but that's okay, 'cause so are you   We've broken our mirrors   Sunday morning is everyday for all I care   And I'm not scared   Light my candles, in a daze   'Cause I've found god      [Repeat: x6]   Yeah, yeah      I'm so lonely, that's ok I shaved my head   And I'm not sad   And just maybe I'm to blame for all I've heard   And I'm not sure   I'm so excited, I can't wait to meet you there   But I don't care   I'm so horny, but that's okay   My will is good      [Repeat: x6]   Yeah, yeah      I like it, I'm not gonna crack   I missed you, I'm not gonna crack   I love you, I'm not gonna crack   I kill you, I'm not gonna crack      I like it, I'm not gonna crack   I missed you, I'm not gonna crack   I love you, I'm not gonna crack   I kill you, I'm not gonna crack      I'm so happy 'cause today   I've found my friends   They're in my head   I'm so ugly, but that's okay, 'cause so are you   We've broken our mirrors   Sunday morning is everyday for all I care   And I'm not scared   Light my candles in a daze   'Cause I've found God      [Repeat: x6]   Yeah, yeah      I like it, I'm not gonna crack   I miss you, I'm not gonna crack   I love you, I'm not gonna crack   I kill you, I'm not gonna crack   I kill you, I'm not gonna crack   I like it, I'm not gonna crack   I miss you, I'm not gonna crack   I love you, I'm not gonna crack   I kill you, I'm not gonna crack.Why have I always been a failure?.I'd rather be gone than in your way..What else has he got?.[Verse 1]   I'm a 45 spinning on an old Victrola   I'm a two strike swinger, I'm a Pepsi Cola   I'm a blue jean quarterback saying ""I love you"" to the prom queen   In a Chevy   I'm John Wayne, Superman, California   I'm a Kris Kristofferson Sunday morning   I'm a mom and daddy singing along to Don McLean   At the levee      [Chorus]   And I'm a child of a backseat freedom, baptized by rock and roll   Marilyn Monroe and the Garden of Eden, never grow up, never grow old   Just another rebel in the great wide open on the boulevard of broken dreams   And I learned everything I needed to know from John Cougar, John Deere, John 3:16      [Post-Chorus]   Hey, hey   Everything I needed   That's right      [Verse 2]   I'm Mark Twain on the Mississippi   I'm Hemingway with a shot of whiskey   I'm a TV dinner on a tray trying to figure out the Wheel of Fortune   I'm a Texaco star, I'm a Gibson guitar   I'm still a teenage kid trying to go too far   I'm a jukebox waiting in a neon bar for a quarter      [Chorus]      [Bridge]   I spent a lot of years running from believing, looking for another way to save my soul   The longer I live, the more I see it: there's only one way home      [Chorus x2]      [Outro]   (John Cougar, John Deere, John 3:16)   Everything I needed   (John Cougar, John Deere, John 3:16)   Everything I needed   (John Cougar, John Deere, John 3:16)   That's right"
"The cyclist was so set on seeing cool, piney trees and lakes, that when he saw dirt, snake, and no source of civilization worried him. More affectively, what he didn’t see scared him most. He did see windy rivers or trails hidden beneath all kinds of trees. He didn’t see any people or friendly little forest critters. Instead he just saw the same rusty color of dirt and the occasional snake. His mood was affected and he started to lose confidence and hope. He wasn't used to the new surroundings and for a while doubted if he could even make it out alive. When he came across the run-down building of Welch’s factory, he was even more distraught. Fortunately, he did find civilization when he came to a fishing supply shop. This definetly boosted his spirits. Once he had saved his thirst problem and assured himself he has alive and would luckily stay that way, he sat down before wading out again in search of his destination..Feel so freaky   I feel so freaky   Listen      There's something about the way you look at me   And it's got me imaginin' and seein' things   Like us both in a room   At my domain   About to blow up and   And hit like a hurricane   And I can't take it no more   And you can't fake it no more   Playin' hard to get girl   Please leave that thought outside the door   Cause the truth of the matter is that you want me and I want you up   So let's quit playin' around and get our ass up under this cover   (ooh)   There's so many things I want to do to you   (ooh)   There's so many things I want for you   (ooh)   On this night I'll make sure you won't regret it   What you and me did in this bed      Girl we'll be bangin,' bangin, bangin', b, b,bangin',   The headboard   Bangin', bangin', bangin', b, b,bangin',   The headboard   Bangin', bangin', bangin', b, b,bangin',   The headboard   Banging', bangin', bangin', b, b,bangin',   The headboard      And ooh (ooh) it feels just like we're floatin' in this pool   And the water bought this fire out of you   And there ain't no other girl on this earth I choose   Baby but you   And I'm going to rock that body fast to sleep   (Girl once you have had enough)   And you goin' to give that body back to me   (As soon as you wake up)   Startin' back all over again   Second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth wind   Til the mornin' comes   I'm goin' to be in (yeah)      (ooh)   There's so many things I want to do to you   (ooh)   And there's so many things I want for you   (ooh)   On this night I'll make sure you won't regret   What me and you did in this bed      (Did, ooh)   Girl we'll be bangin', bangin', bangin', b, b,bangin'   The headboard   (Bangin' the headboard)   Bangin', bangin', bangin', b, b,bangin',   The headboard   (ooh yeah)   Bangin', bangin', bangin', b, b,bangin',   The headboard   Bangin', bangin', bangin', b, b,bangin',   The headboard      Baby hold the pillow tight it's bout to be a wild night   Squeak in the bed   And we'll going to make the walls bang   Squeak in the bed   And baby-girl I hope that you can hang   Ooh Ooh   And those are the sounds that were makin'   When were bangin', bangin', bangin', (Yeah)      We'll be bangin', bangin', bangin', b, b,bangin'   The headboard   (Bangin' the headboard)   Bangin', bangin', bangin, b, b,bangin'   The headboard   (Bangin' the headboard oooooo)   Bangin', bangin', bangin', b, b,bangin'   The headboard   (We'll be)   (b, b, bangin' the headboard)   (We'll gonna wake the neighor's up)   (cause your screaming, frowns I'm tearin' it up)   (Hit don't stop til the mornin' comes)   Bangin' (umm) bangin' (umm) bangin' (ummm)   Bangin', bangin', b, b,bangin',   Bangin', bangin', b, b,bangin'.It's no secret that lately there ain't no escape   And that I've been waking up alone   Just me and the tv and a sinking feeling   That you ain't ever coming home      But today,   The tears ain't gonna hit the floor   Cause the boat's in the bay   And it's calling my name   So I'm heading on out the door      Cause the sun's too bright,   The sky's too blue   Beer's too cold to be thinking about you   Gonna take this heartbreak and tuck it away   Save it for a rainy day      When I turned the ignition   I knew I'd be missing   The feel of the wind on my face   I was stuck in a habit      Wondering what happened   Two days of taking all the blame   Got a drink, or two,   That's as fool proof as what it will be   It's a beautiful world with a beautiful girl   Kind of making eyes at me      Cause the sun's too bright,   The sky's too blue   Beer's too cold to be thinking about you   Gonna take this heartbreak and tuck it away   Save it for a rainy day      Yeah, the music's too good,   My friends are all out   And they're all too high to be bringing them down   If they ask about you   I've got nothing to say   I'll save it for a rainy day      They'll be plenty of time for ones and why's   And how'd I let you get away   But the lying in bed all stuck in my head   Is just gonna have to wait      Cause the sun's too bright,   The sky's too blue   Beer's too cold to be thinking about you   Gonna take this heartbreak and tuck it away   Save it for a rainy day      Yeah, the music's too good,   My friends are all out   And they're all too high to be bringing them down   If they ask about you   I've got nothing to say   I'll save it for a rainy day      Gonna take this heartbreak and tuck it away   Save it for a rainy day   Save it for a rainy day.My eye on you!.I don't know why,   The way you're falling away from me..Man, I gotta, I gotta, I gotta be..Shaking, shaking,   Shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake,   Shake!.Tha priest tha book or tha congregation?"
"Rolling hills, open terran, hgh deserts-all are features of the setting that affect the cyclist. First, Rolling Hills could take energy out of the cyclist when having to travel for miles on end. The open terrain leads to the beating sun which also puts pressure on the cyclist. Lastly, high deserts would have an affect on the cyclist because he has to pedal for mles on end in rough dry terrain putting strain on him overall..Shouting both: This song is dedicated for all the motherfuckers   Who harm with no reason, hey your not the drug, so don't try to be one   Remember that shit comes..

"The setting and features affect the cyclist because with each building he hopes for water, but since he is traveling through a desert water is in limited supply and many empty buildings are left out in the wastland. These buildings create a feeling of releve in the cyclist anty to be followed by despair to find them abandoned. The land with no features also creates a feeling of lost hope in the rider making his entire ordeal that much harder. Over all it was an excureiatly experience physicly and mentaly for the cyclists..Those crazy dreams   We threw, we threw away   I never been alone with you   I never could   They say      That love will find a way   And love will never be set free   I won't ever let you see   You could not understand   You never will      Be who you are   I bless I bless your name   And all that summer madness caused the rain   And we, we      The glory that we made   My love will grace the halls of time   A love that never can be mine   You could not love me then   I love you still      Be who you are   Seize life and find a way   And I will be that shadow loving who you are   Be who you are   We were.Miracle you saved me from some pain   I thank you Mr..The immigrants an' remnants of all the glory years   Are clustered around the bar again for another round of beers   Little Richard's in the kitchen playing spoons and plates   He's telling the waitress he's great      Ah say I know somewhere back'n'forth in time   Out on the dustbowls, deep in the roulette mine   Or in a ghetto cellar only yesterday   There's a move into the future for the USA..You were playing a game and I,   I lost count of the days and the nights..There were times when I stood at death's own door   Only searching for an answer..In black and white, and taught me wrong from right   It's your heart that held you tight   But we're only love   Spin me around and round and round   Love calling your name   I will live on   Calling your name   And the world seems like my enemy   The waterfall of frowns   And the wave of life will capture me   And I'm falling down upon love   C'mon now darling   I'm falling falling down on love   I'm falling down, falling down on love   I'm falling down on love   [Chorus:].Yes, she bade me to come in,   And to kiss her on the chin."
"The cyclist was affected majorly by a few dreadful parts of the setting. In the beginning, when it was not as hot and he had plenty of water, the cyclist was absolutely fine. As the day went on, he felt the heat bearing down on him. He drank all his water, and now he felt desperate. His mood changed with the setting, and he was extremely happy once he reached Gary and @ORGANIZATION1. Also, this cyclist decided to blame the old men for giving him bad directions when he was in trouble, but he thanked them once he realized they were correct..Walking around in womens underwear      In the office there's a guy named Melvin..Have you heard about Bill Chambers mother?.Now, if she ever comes now, now   If she ever comes now, now   If she ever comes now...

" The features of the setting affect the cyclist because real cyclist know what the speed is for a bike so you don’t need to tell them. If a cyclist needed some dierections they would go to a gas station not to some old person’s house. A real cyclist can go as long as they want before the stop because they are tired. A real cyclist knows haw to do tricks on a bike don’t have to do them over and over again to be able to do them. A real cyclist doesn’t have to train to go into a tourtement and win they must have to practice to be able to win..Come on and kiss me just to show you're glad   Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby   Baby, baby, baby, don'cha go 'way mad   Now, don'cha go away mad.Trying times when the going gets tough..I'll be down to get you in a taxi honey   Better be ready 'bout half past eight   I mean don't be late   Be there when the band starts playin'   Remember when you get there honey   Dance all over the floor   Dance all over my shoes   When the band plays the Jelly Roll blues   Set 'em all alight      At the darktown strutters ball   I'll be down to get you in a push cart honey   Better be ready 'bout half past eight   I mean don't be late   Be there when the band starts playin'      'Member when you get there honey   Shim sham wins them all   Dance all over my shoes   When the band plays the Jelly Roll's blues   Set 'em all alight   (At) the darktown strutters ball.Oh, I should have known   You're late again   No, no, no, no   And now I'm here   Will you appear?.Baby baby, can I be the one, to love you with all of my might?.Take my time..It's cause the streets is watching   With an envious ear, jealous eye   You know how William H. Bonnie's rockin   I keep the home ???"
"The setting in “Rough Road Ahead: Do not exceed posted speed limit,” affected the cyclist greatly. For starters it says he was “traveling through the high desserts” which is never a safe thing. He had been drinking he water regularly but the temperature was rising. He was, “trying to keep balance in my dehydrated state.” From lack of water because the terrain had altered his water into “A far like substance” The setting of the story was cruel to the cyclist..Music sweet music, sweet music, sweet music, uh..Ma che c'?.We share each other   While the suns going down   Not another soul around   Alone at last,   Alone at last,   You and I..Make it sing it's song   Make it fight   Make it fight, fight!.And I know that we'll all be fine..Burn!.You can really learn a lot that way   It will change you in the middle of the day."
"The cyclist is affected by the change in terrain from flat to hilly, the elderly men’s directions and most importantly his thirst. He tries to save what little water he has left for time when he really needs it. He looks for a place to cool off and get water, which he finally does in the end. He’s also a little bit angry and disappointed of the old men’s directions. He’s really going a lot more miles then he should be according to the directionsand he's beginning to wonder if they’ve lost it. .We are born without eyesight   We are born without sin   And our mama protects us   From the cold and the rain   We're in no hurry   sugar and spice   We sing in the darkness   We open our eyes (open up)      I can't believe it   And people are strange   Our president's crazy   Did you hear what he said   Business and pleasure   Lie right to your face   Divide it in sections   And then give it away      There are no big secrets   Don't believe what you read   We have great big bodies   We got great big heads   Run-a-run-a-run it all together   Check it out - still don't make no sense   Makin' flippy floppy   Tryin to do my best   Lock the door   We kill the beast   Kill it!.An' a coma stole my name   Coma!.Let it go, baby..The future's for discovering   The space in which we're traveling      From the top of the first page   To the end of the last day   From the start in your own way   You just want somebody listening to what you say   It doesn't matter who you are   It doesn't matter who you are      Under the surface trying to break through   Deciphering the codes in you   I need a compass, draw me a map   I'm on the top, I can't get back      Whoa whoa      The first line on the first page   To the end of the last page   From the start in your own way   You just want somebody listening to what you say   It doesn't matter who you are   It doesn't matter who you are      You just want   Somebody listening to what you say   Oh, you just want somebody listening to what you say   It doesn't matter who you are   It doesn't matter who you are      Is there anybody out there who   Is lost and hurt and lonely too   Are they bleeding all your colors into one?.SUFFERING NOW!.Nice to see   Nice to see you, I've been feeling so blue   Owning up now 'cause you change my point of view   It's funny how you do what you do   It's a very good sign, a really good line for you   I've been waiting for the heat of the night   Warming up now and you've got me in your sights   So tell me what you want me to do   It's a very good time to tell you I've been thinking of you   Because you're wonderful baby and you're beautiful, baby   It's a very good sign, a very good time of life   Let me tell you, you're a woman with style   I've been waiting, but you made it all worthwhile   And all you had to do was to smile   You're a very good sign and everything's fine, my child   'cause you're wonderful baby and you're beautiful, baby   It's a very good sign, a very good time of life, ooh   Set in my ways I live from day to day happy to be free, hey   Needing for nothing, always looking for someone who could make me see   But baby, I was so wrong, I sat here waiting too long   To have you here with me, oh   'cause you're wonderful baby and you're beautiful, baby   It's a very good sign, a very good time of life   'cause you're wonderful baby and you're beautiful, baby   It's a very good sign, a very good time of life, oh   Oh, it's a very good sign, oh yeah, a very good sign   Yeah, it's a very good time, oh, very good time   Oh yeah, a very good sign, oh yeah, a very good sign   Oh, it's a very, very good sign, oh yeah, a very good sign.The immigrants an' remnants of all the glory years   Are clustered around the bar again for another round of beers   Little Richard's in the kitchen playing spoons and plates   He's telling the waitress he's great      Ah say I know somewhere back'n'forth in time   Out on the dustbowls, deep in the roulette mine   Or in a ghetto cellar only yesterday   There's a move into the future for the USA."
"The feature in the short story affect the cyclist because with no towns around there is now water. In the story is says, “The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips.” This means the cyclist was short on water and needed to find a town soon. Cycling in the desert and up down hills made it harder and hotter. The heart could cause dehydration or a heatstroke because it says, “and the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke” the buildings the cyclist did see were not any help to him because they had no water. Eventually he came to a fishing camp and found water in the sink of the bathroom. The story says, “I stumbled into a rather modern bathroom and drank deeply from the sink.” This is where the setting changes because the cyclist found cool water finally..Who the fuck came in the game made her own cologne?.The love was shining in my eyes so couldn't see the lies   In her eyes..It's cold and I've nowhere to sleep,   Is there somewhere you can tell me?'.We're gunna wake up hate   We're gunna fuck you up      I want to break everything   I want to make it safe   We're gunna wake up hate   We're gunna wake it up      You gotta get it straight   We're gunna give it up   We're gunna wake up hate   We're gunna fuck you up      I want to break everything   I want to make it safe   We're gunna wake up hate   We're gunna wake it up      I am the falling of my happiness   It is no more   Stop loving, I'm still hating   Till I can not hate no more      I've had to suffer   I cannot wait for more..Looking back yeah I feel alright   Getting more than my expectations   Yeah my future looks clear and bright   I'm living up to my reputation      Yeah, I'm satisfied   Yeah, until the day I die      I gave my blood and I gave my soul   I stood my ground and I took control   The legend's growing as the story's told   I pledge allegiance to the state, of rock and roll   Oh yeah!.Have you given up on truth?.Would you comfort me?"
"With little water the setting was not helpful to the cyclist. Joe @PERSON1 said, “There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind” (@PERSON1). After receiving bad directions from a few old men having people passing by in cars or near by stores would probably help the cyclist for asking directions. @PERSON1 said, ""working the handle of the rusted water pump with all my strength"" (@PERSON1). Having no water to replenish your body will make you weak and unstable. In the middle of no  where that is a problem. @PERSON1 also said, ""Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills” (@PERSON1). With little water left and a weak body it must have been hard going up and down those @NUM1 also said, “I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June” (@PERSON1). I dust in your lungs and heat from the sun as it becomes harder for your body to work..But to love the lord with all your heart, should be your one desire..I know she's a freak and I don't have a doubt   She's a dirty bitch and I don't have a doubt!.Performed by: The Heartbreakers      Every time I see you....Why did you have to die?.I was strolling through the streets of Paris   And it was cold it was starting to rain..Will it stop if I close my eyes?.All we ever look for, a little bit of you, too."
" The features of the setting affect the cycleist in many diferent ways. For example it was June and he was in the @CAPS1 of California. It was very hot and the dehydrated him. Also he did no know where he was going so he had to rely on other people directions. Also he had to keep dehydrate. That what affected the cycleist. .We want Billy   Where is Billy   Give us Billy   We want Billy   B-I double L-Y   We're all his   He's our kind of a guy   And ooh what luck   Cuz here he is      (bandmaster speaking)   Ladies and Gentlemen   Presenting the silver tongued prince of the courtroom   The one the only   Billy Flynn!!!!.Come along with me   Leave the past and now this time you'll see (won't you see?).There are angels singing low inside my head   Cool tango blue and samba red   I want to scratch your name upon my wall   Cause I'm drowning here beneath love's waterfall      Deep water   Deep water      Baby you're love's got a hold on me   You row my boat right out to the sea   See the woman inside the girl   Dancing on the roof of the invisible world      We are walking like the waves beside the sea   There are oceans in my eyes that you can't see   And my arms reach out for you into the dark   I feel your skin where my nails left their mark      Deep water   Deep water      Baby you're love's got a hold on me   You row my boat right out to the sea   See the woman inside the girl   Dancing on the roof of the invisible world      Souls alike   Hands alike      Baby you're love's got a hold on me   You row my boat right out to the sea   See the woman inside the girl   Dancing on the roof of the invisible world      Baby you're love's got a hold on me   You row my boat right out to the sea   See the woman inside the girl   Dancing on the roof of the invisible world      Souls alike   Hands alike.Burn motherfucker   Burn!.I can see her slowly walking   Through the empty streets of morning   Who she's with I cannot tell   His face fades with the others   In the endless spell of dreams I know so well      Though she walks with him no more with me   And I know she's where she wants to be   Her happiness is there for all to see   But I find that I still wish it was for me      I can hear her voice still ringing   Through the empty songs I sing   And it seems that all the words I find   To say the things that crowd my mind   Only bring me closer   To the things I'd rather leave behind      Though I know the game's been played   And I know the mistakes I've made   I know I shouldn't be afraid   To love, for love for any time at all   Is worth the price you pay to fall.Unruly boys   Who will not grow up   Must be taken in hand   Unruly girls   Who will not settle down   They must be taken in hand      A crack on the head   Is what you get for not asking   And a crack on the head   Is what you get for asking      Unruly boys   Who will not grow up   Must be taken in hand   Unruly girls   Who will not settle down   They must be taken in hand      A crack on the head   Is what you get for not asking   And a crack on the head   Is what you get for asking      No...a crack on the head   Is what you get for not asking   And a crack on the head   Is what you get for asking      A crack on the head   Is just what you get   Why?.Whatever I need, she supplied."
"The feature’s of the setting affect the cyclist because, the cyclist is dehydrated and has to nde on a horrible conditions of a road, snakes and hills. All of these features act like obstacle courses, which makes it hard to do what he’s trying to do which is recieve water. Also, with the cyclist being hot and in need of water he at this point is delinous and most likely doesn’t know whats going on. In the story the authors main feature of the setting is the road. “Rough road ahead.”  This explains the cyclist having to go on a rough road, and doing that dehydrated is very dangerous these are some of the features of the setting that affect the cyclist.  .I brought my life, my ugly wife, my dirty dog with fleas   My kid's a punk, and I'm a drunk, this I'm sure you'll see   Yeah you don't know, what it's like, to live in misery   Welcome to, home sweet hell, dissatisfaction guaranteed   It's a beautiful day in the neighborhood   And if I could I surely would   Invite you in and say   Won't you be my neighbor?.Never mind the wind and weather,   If we walk that trail together,   Somehow we'll find our way..Guilty 'til proven innocent   I'm thinking about the government   Wondering where the money went   Into outer space, I guess   Lying CS's everywhere   Pretty boys in their underwear..Yea!.Or will this feeling stay?.Hey!.Oh her marvelous rear."
"The features of the setting on the way to Yosemite National Park, greatly affected the cyclist. On the way to the park, the cyclist had encountered the heat of the desert in California. Besides the heat the cyclist had to overcome the rough terrain of the of the short, rolling hills. This made the cyclist tired and weary. Adding to his weakness, and the extreme heat, he also ran out of water, causing him to become dehydrated. “Wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from a heat stroke...laugh.” This trip through the California desert greatly affected the cyclist by causing great exhaustion and dehydration..You ask me why   Why I'm so different   Why I'm not the same as everybody else   Well something changed   It just happened   When I opened up my heart and let Him in   Jesus came in he came into my life   And I know I never felt so good..Shaming the rose and lily   For she is twice as fair      Though I am nothing to her   Though she must rarely look at me   And though I could never woo her   I love her till I die      Surely you heard my lady   Go down the garden singing?.Oh no no no no no now, yeah ha..

"The features of the setting in the essay “Do not exceed the posted speed limit” affected the cyclist in a negative way. The more and more he rode, he thought more negatively and had alot of doubt. The cyclist was not very confident, he thought he wouldn’t make it. For example, when the cyclist notices nothing in sight, his tone changes. “There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind. I began breaking the ride down into distances I could see on the horizon telling myself that if I could make it that far , I’d be fine”. He seemed unsure and a little nervous. As the journey continued, the cyclist loses hope it seems. “It didn’t really matter. I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean leaving only some expensive outdoor gear and a diary” He does not see himself finishing this journey the more and more he rides in the middle of nowhere with nothing to be seen except “Rough Road Ahead” signs.  .Guess I could find somebody, too,   But I don't want no one but you..Well it looks like it's another Skynyrd Family Christmas time   Seems like it was just New Years day   Started out in old L.A.

"The older men gave him directions that were acctully really bad. Nature wasn’t on is side that’s for sure. First of all he ran out of water because of the heat. Secondly a snake blocked his path and he didn’t want to tempt it. Thirdly he became so overheated that it was possible for him to suffer a heat stroke in the middle of nowhere. Also he kept going to abandoned buildings. It was so bad that the stone relied on for his thirst got stuck in his throat, he was then lead to a bait shop that was absolutely in the middle of nowhere and he had no way of getting home..Leading me on to the pictures that I want to see      Fantasy lovingly restored to me   Magic moments from the past, magic moments   Mysteries from the ball      Back at the table it's getting too hot for me   Ice is afloat on my wings   Caught in the thunder and lightning of everything   Caught in the everyday things   Moving on up is the feeling inside of me   Losing my grip on the floor   Holding on tight to the hand that has given me more      Fantasy lovingly restored to me   Magic moments from the past, magic moments   Mysteries from the ball      Running along on the side of the waterfront   Someone is looking at me   Trying to turn me around like an enemy   Trying to turn me away   Moving on up is the feeling inside of me   Losing my grip on the floor   Holding on tight to the hand that is giving me more      Fantasy lovingly restored to me   Magic moments from the past, magic moments   Mysteries from the ball lovingly restored to me   Magic moments from the past lovingly restored to me   Mysteries from the ball.)(fix a face? ).And you won't get no lies,   And if you steal away,   I'll be your only lover..Hey, bo diddley!.(Axl Rose and Gilby Clarke)      Well when you're sitting there in your silk upholstered chair   Talkin' to some rich folk that you know   Well I hope you won't see me in my ragged company   I never thought I'd ever be alone         Take me down little Susie, take me down   I know you think you're the queen of the underground   And you can send me dead flowers every morning   Send me dead flowers by the mail   Send me dead flowers to my wedding   And I won't forget to put roses on your grave      Well when you're sitting back in your rose pink Cadillac   Making bets on Kentucky Derby Day   Ah, I'll be in my basement room with a needle and a spoon   And another whore to take my pain away      Take me down little Susie, take me down   I know you think you're the queen of the underground   And you can send me dead flowers every morning   Send me dead flowers by the mail   Send me dead flowers to my wedding   And I won't forget to put roses on your grave      Take me down little Susie, take me down   I know you think you're the queen of the underground   And you can send me dead flowers every morning   Send me dead flowers by the U.S. Mail   Say it with dead flowers in my wedding   And I won't forget to put roses on your grave   No, I won't forget to put roses on your grave.Did you?.I'm stuck in black and white   You're in technical brightness   Why can't I see you?"
" The cyclist choose to take an old abandoned route to @LOCATION1. The route had in some places no buildings at all to see making the cyclist loss hope of his need for water. Until the end there was no one on the route making him all alone. So if something happen who would know. During his adventure he ran out of water making him dehydrated that didn’t help. The setting of the story seems tragic to the cyclist..Some believe in children..If I told you that I lie sometimes,   If I told you that I'd run away,   If I told you who I was before,   Would you follow me?.I'm comin' Lord, for my heavenly reward   I'm comin' home to you, can you see me comin' thru   Thru clouds of persecution, and stumblin' on my way   I 'spect I'm only makin', 'bout a half a mile a day      The road to heaven doesn't have a rapid transit plan,   It's one way with no changes heading to the promised land   But I believe that if I'll heed the things He had to say,   Even I might get to heaven at a half a mile a day      Lord, when I let you lead, I never make much speed   ""Cause I have to stop and touch, the ones who need so much   Then sometimes others pull me, off of Your narrow way   And by my mistakes, I barely make, a half a mile a day      The road to heaven doesn't have a rapid transit plan,   It's one way with no changes heading to the promised land   But I believe that if I'll heed the things He had to say,   Even I might get to heaven at a half a mile a day.Do or die that is my question   A little seed burning in me   It's hot I must get water   Racing towards the sun   Do or die break or burn   I've still got so much to learn   My breath is tearing with the dying sun   Racing towards the sun   I can't breath   I got sucked underneath   She won't fight for breath now   Have a little taste of death now   Rise and fall rise and fall   I've seen it all   Racing towards the sun.No matter what happenes, no matter where life   Takes us, I will never leave you..Sugar fix, dirty tricks and a trick question..Ha, ha, funny, how you broke me up."
"In the story “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” the features of the setting effect the cyclist. They effect the cyclist’s confidence, and hope. I say this because through out the story he sees things that would consern other people like the towns that are suppose to be the best end up “Ghost towns” and the road from flat to hills. Yet he continues on and then says “what I believed was my last burst of energy,” “I was going to die.” The cyclist dosent think he can continue but manages to keep going hoping that the next horizon to see a building or something. Hope saved his life because if he knew he could not continue that he could die..The sky is changing   The clouds are gathering, we can see   It's growing darker day by day,   But I'm so high      Within this stormy weather   God is the wind, could take my soul,   Even as I pray..Somewhere there's speaking   It's already coming in   Oh and it's rising at the back of your mind   You never could get it   Unless you were fed it   Now you're here and you don't know why      But under skinned knees and the skid marks   Past the places where you used to learn   You howl and listen   Listen and wait for the   Echoes of angels who won't return      [Chorus]   He's everything you want   He's everything you need   He's everything inside of you   That you wish you could be   He says all the right things   At exactly the right time   But he means nothing to you   And you don't know why      You're waiting for someone   To put you together   You're waiting for someone to push you away   There's always another wound to discover   There's always something more you wish he'd say      [Chorus]      But you'll just sit tight   And watch it unwind   It's only what you're asking for   And you'll be just fine   With all of your time   It's only what you're waiting for      Out of the island   Into the highway   Past the places where you might have turned   You never did notice   But you still hide away   The anger of angels who won't return      [Chorus]      I am everything you want   I am everything you need   I am everything inside of you   That you wish you could be   I say all the right things   At exactly the right time   But I mean nothing to you and I don't know why   And I don't know why   Why   I don't know.These are your friends from childhood, through youth,   Who goaded you on, demanded more proof,   Withdrawal pain is hard, it can do you right in,   So distorted and thin, distorted and thin..You take it all away, you take it all away.It's a passion, and emotion, it's a fashion, Burlesque   It'll move you, goin' through you, so do what I do, Burlesque   All ladies come put your grown up, boys throw it up if you want it   Can you feel me, can you feel it?.Pretty Boy ....

"The features of the setting affect the cyclist in the essay “Rough Road Ahead” by Joe Kurmaskie in many ways. One way the setting affected the cyclist way when it got hot and the rider was running out of water. another way the cyclist was affected by the setting was when he said he ""could die of heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June simply because of listened to some gentlemen who hadn’t been off their porch in decades caused me to laugh. a third way the cyclist was affected was was when he went inside the bait shop and cooled down. lastly when he rehydrated himself in the  so the setting was a main factory to the cyclist in the essay “Rough Road Ahead” by Joe kurmaskie on his way to Yosemite national park..But then one day, and the day was blue,   Came a man who didn't ask at all..The magic of music is a sign of consciousness   That could be understood   On far-flung worlds millions of light years from our horizon..Fidele comme une ombre qui te suit,   (Faithful as a shadow that follows you,)   Chaque jour de ta vie..Bitch, get in the car then I'll take you to the bar   But I took her to the alley, and kicked her with the balley   Stomped her in her face, her chicky chicky face   You took my heart and bit it so I took your lip and split it      You took my life and crushed it I took your head and bust it   I take your leg and break it I take your life and take it   And bitch it's no surprise I'm not like other guys   Take it, take it, take it cut off your head and bake it      And bitch it's no surprise I'm quick to blacken your eyes   Tommy son take off your coat I'll make you feel at home   Take that razor to your throat, I'm from the ghetto zone   Bitchy bitchy hoe, you fucking freaky hoe.You read the business page   See how you did today   You live up on the hill   You've got a view that kills   Never wonder why      [Bridge]   After you've counted everything you saved   Do you ever hit your knees and pray?.But there's a peace the early brings   The morning world of growing things..There's no business like show business and I tell you it's so   Traveling through the country is so thrilling, standing out in front on opening nights   Smiling as you watch the theater filling, and there's your billing out there in lights      There's no people like show people, they smile when they are low   Angels come from everywhere with lots of jack, and when you lose it, there's no attack   Where could you get money that you don't give back?"
"The features of the setting affected the cyclist in many ways. Like he was in a desert, no one to give him good information, no towns close by that are still running, it was a hot summer day, no water near by. These affected the cyclist because they made him not sweaty, dry mouth, no energy, and he was having alot of doubt that he was not going to make his journey alive. In the story they cyclist said, ''I picked up some pebble and put them in my mouth. With my luer. I'd hit a bump and lodge one in my throat. It didn’t really matter. I was going to die. ''When he said that he showed alot of doubt. Everytime he got to a town or bulding it was abandoned. He saw an abandoned  building witch was ironically a Welch's Grape Juice factory and bottling plant. That made him even more thirstier. Thats how the features affected the cyclist..The blues is my business, and business is good..Let's get away from sleigh bells   Let's get away from snow   Let's make a break some Christmas, dear   I know the place to go      How'd ya like to spend Christmas on Christmas Island?.Danny says we gotta go   Gotta go to Idaho   But we can't go surfin'   Cause it's twenty below      Sound check's at 5:02   Record stores and interviews   Oh, but I can't wait   To be with you tomorrow      Baby      Oho-ho-ho, we got nowhere to go   And it may sound funny, but it's true   Hangin' out in 100 B   Watching 'Get Smart' on TV   Thinkin' about   You and me and you and me      Hangin' out in L.A.

"The features of the setting affected the cyclist. The dry desert affected the cyclist because these was no water and the cyclist was dehydrated. The strong heat, because the cyclist could bare had a heat stroke. The animals because the snake could have killed the cyclist and these was no one in miles to help. In the story it says, “These was no one in sight, not a bulling, car or structure of any kind,” If the cyclist had needed help then the  cyclist could most likely have died. if I was the cyclist, I probably would have given up by then but I’m glad the cyclist didn`t.

" The features of setting affect the cyclist in many ways. At first when he sees the tall pines and the river he is calm: and chilled out. But when he sees the abandoned “@PERSON1’s Grape Juice” factory he becomes desperate and thinks he is going to die out in the desert. A guy travels to @ORGANIZATION1 where he meets “old timers and the give him a “shortcut” to the park. He then goes on his bike to the park taking their “shortcut.” While traveling starts to run out of water and then he thinks he is going to die out in the desert. “It din’t really matter. I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean.” This quote means now that he is out in the desert he thinks he is going to die since he has no more water. This relates because he becomes desperate  for water because he is out in the desert in the midde of June..My mind's just swept love aside..J'entends ma mere m'appeler pour souper- nous irons jouer sur le bord de l'eau [repeat]   Et les petits enfants pleurer-nous irons jouer sur le bord de l'eau..It happened in an open field   Down in a southern state   And no one knows the reason why   Some would say it's hate   They shot the guy who sold the dogs   It came as some surprise   And to a lady standing there   Brought sadness to her eyes   She's a rock and roll widow living in this town   Another rock and roll widow since they gunned him down   The heat of day still hung around   As night began to fall   The sheriff came up from the town   In answer to the call   The band played on in darkness   Not knowing what to do   As people ran from side to side   Just looking for a clue.Want your bad romance      Rah rah ah-ah-ah!.It's all the same old stuff   They think it's good enough   It works, and nobody got hurt   It happends every time   Like anybody minds   You're telling me it's just the way it works      It's not over 'till it's over, anyway   It's not over 'till it's over, anyway   It's not over 'till it's over, anyway   It ain't broke so fix it anyway   Yeah, yeah, yeah....I'm half a sinner, and I'm half a saint   It's hard to tell by the company I keep   That I'm tryin' to live in a state of grace   It's risky business, it's the queen of hearts   That's the way it is, there's no holds barred   But if your dream comes true, there's something to sing about   Blue eyes, I don't want to lose you   Don't lie, I don't want to lose   Blue eyes, I don't want to lose your love   Sweet satisfaction, wrapped in the arms of a warm embrace   No fascination could ever take your place   Light up the shadows   Brick by brick the walls come down   Who can judge your magic love   So mystically profound   Blue eyes, I don't want to lose you   Don't lie, I don't want to lose   Blue eyes, I don't want to cry   Don't cry, I don't want to lose   Blue eyes, I don't want to lose your love   Ooh, I need you   You know I need you so much   Ooh, I need   I can't resist your warm touch   Eyes, blue eyes   How many times must the words be spoken   Eyes, blue eyes   How many times must the heart be broken tonight   Blue eyes, I don't want to lose you   Don't lie, I don't want to lose   Blue eyes, I don't want to lose your love   Sweet satisfaction, wrapped in the arms of a warm embrace   No fascination could ever take your place   Light up the shadows   Brick by brick the walls come down   Who can judge your magic love   So mystically profound   Blue eyes, I don't want to lose you   Don't lie, I don't want to lose   Blue eyes, I don't want to cry   Don't cry, I don't want to lose   Blue eyes, I don't want to lose your love   Ooh, I need you   You know I need you so much   Ooh, I need   I can't resist your warm touch   Eyes, blue eyes   How many times must the words be spoken   Eyes, blue eyes   How many times must the heart be broken tonight   Blue eyes, I don't want to lose you   Don't lie   Blue eyes, I don't want to lose you   Don't lie   Blue eyes, I don't want to lose you   Don't lie   I don't want to lose   Blue eyes, I don't want to cry   Don't cry.But something's wrong, I cannot move around,   My leg is caught, it's pulling me down,   But I'll keep my hand shut tight, for if they find me,   They'll find the pearl for Leah."
"The features of the setting greatly affected the cyclist. For example, the cyclist was in California, which is an extremely hot place in the desert in June. These features made dehydration a more keen possibility. Another example, is paragraph ten. It explains how the rough road, tumbleweeds, and large snake made it hard for the cyclist to keep his balance without water. Also, the essay describes a building with a poster of a small child drinking a refreshing glass of juice,this made the cyclist think more about water and  become very thirsty. Although thier was some possitive effects of the setting on the cyclist. The pebbles aloud him to keep his mouth moist and not think so much of his thirst. Also, the bait shopped allowed him to opt something to drink, and not die from dehydration..[what we ridin?].Dear Mrs. Reagan, I hope you're feeling well   Fighting drugs and abortion will keep you out of hell   Send in the troops, they'll shut the system down   Take away their leaders and replace them all with clowns      Out in the Rose Garden, time for a speech   Make up your face so it looks like a peach      Aw, Nancy dear, what shall I say?.Use their skin as a drum   (Do the Pachacuti!).The endless pain has started..His loving presence is so near..What mattered to me was the right to be free   Like I'll be someday   I'm waiting for my heart to lead the way   The places I've seen and the roads in between   Make me wonder why   I'm searching for my dreams up in the sky   I heard the call   In the mirror I saw the writing on the wall   And I had to fall in love with you   The face that I've known seems so lost and alone   When you're far away   I'm comin' for you baby right away   The places I've seen and the roads in between   Make me wonder why   I'm searching for me dreams up in the sky   I heard the call   In the mirror I saw the writing on the wall   And I had to fall in love with you   What mattered to me was the right to be free   Like I'll be someday   I'm waiting for my heart to lead the way.Because nothing loves you like I do."
"The features of the setting did not help the cyclist on his trip. First of all he was in the desert on a bike! Which helped him dehydrate faster. Secondly, the ‘towns’ around the way  had been abandoned, leaving no place to get more water and no place to ask for directions. Lastly there were no other people around so if the cyclist was to get into trouble, he wouldn't be able to find help. .I courted her proudly but now she is gone,   Gone as the season she's taken..I have lost the stars and the sky   It was so that I could keep the earth   So now I'm found   Beyond the rocket-burst among the burned out fireworks   In No-vember      The only unforgivable thing   Is comfortable in it's own skin   Whispers ""Why did you do this to me?"".Striking out?.Pistolero let her go.tonight you're mine Pistolero..Individuality   Buying pennies with my soul   And a little Heaven spent   While the Hell I'm taking      Thieves   Parasites   Hide from life   You know they'll remember me      They are abhored   In self-worth   All that matters much to me.Writing songs that I think sound so strange   Writing words that I feel I should change   It's all right if they sound just like other songs   My guitar strums along just the same   If this song's underlined with my name      Nanana na nana na na na na na na   Nanana na nana na na na na na   Nanana na nana na na na na na na   Nanana na nana na na na na na      Playing games that I think may be wrong   Making sounds that can go on and on   It's all right if you stay right on to the end   If my song could've been just a bore   Then I hope you may come back for more      Nanana na nana na na na na na na   Nanana na nana na na na na na   Nanana na nana na na na na na na   Nanana na nana na na na na na   Nanana na nana na na na na na na   Nanana na nana na na na na na....I've done more now than a clear-thinkin' man would do      Mary, Mary, it's not over   Where you go, I will follow   Till I win your love again   And walk beside you   But until then   Mary, Mary, where you goin' to?"

"The setting in this story was hot and filled with rolling hills. These factors greatly effected the cyclist. The hot weather was bad for the cyclist because he had a limited water supply.The text says, “The sun was beginning to beat down” (@NUM1). Showing the temperature was rising.  The text says, ""Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills"" (@NUM2). The author’s battery was leaking acid so it was harder to make it over the hills.

" The features of the setting affect the cyclist because there was a lot of detours and distractions where the cyclist rode.

"In this story, the cyclist had to ride threw the desert, during june and with little water. I would say that this has a big effect on the cyclist since he dehydrates alot and is threatened with heatstroke. Also he had to ride careful past a huge snake which could have hurt him.

"The features of setting affect the cyclist. It was hard arrived at the first town for author.

"In the story, “Rough Road Ahead”, by Joe Kurmaskie, the cyclist was affected by the setting. The cyclist has said that he had to ride over terrain that was smooth at first but then turned into rolling hills. He also had to find his way around a big snake while being dehydrated. The cyclist was mainly affected because he was out of water when he was riding on his bike through a desert like area, but because he was determined to reach water he made it through..But now all the

"In the essay, “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” there are many features of the setting that greatly affect the cyclist. Many of these features affect him in a negative way. One such feature is the hills that are present in the essay. These probably exasperated the cyclist even more than he already was with the sun beating down on him. Another feature was the road sign that said “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” “The speed limit was @NUM1. I was doing a water-depleting @NUM2. Sometimes life can feel so cruel.” The author/cyclist probably felt like he would never make it. Also, the sign advertising grape juice probably made him feel life was even crueler with its sadistic irony. Finally, the bait shop offered much relief to the cyclist. “I had an overwhelming urge to seek out Gary and Wilber, kiss them, and buy some bait.” All in all, the setting affected the cyclist in some pretty bad ways until the end..Why can't the night last forever..What a joyous day      Silent night, holy night..I don't wanna look for words   I don't wanna work that hard   I want your song in my head   The way you sing it from the heart yeah      Whenever I get lost   Whenever I feel weak   Whenever or just because   You whisper it to me      Honey, maybe everything you need   Is on the other side of this feeling   Honey, please      But when I 'look for words'   For more going concerns   For the 'adventure of ideas'   'Adventure never returns' yeah      Whenever I get stuck   Whenever I can't speak   Whenever just because   You do it in your sleep      Honey, maybe everything you need   Is on the other side of this feeling   Honey, please      When all 'the poetry of the earth'   Might be all there is   It might still have some worth   Yeah, but I can't dance to it      Honey everything we need   Is on the other side of this feeling   This feeling      Honey, right here underneath our feet   Under all the stars of the County   Everything we need   Honey, please      Under all the stars of the County with you tonight   Under all the stars of the County with you by my side   Under all the stars of the County shining bright   Under all the stars of the County with you tonight.And did you forget my song?.Can't you tell I'm in tune and I'm movin' so much closer to you?.And everyone that's ever suffered, friend or foe or wives or lovers..Haha, today was a good day   Sometimes I just get on my knees you know what I mean   And pray to the man with the master plan      [Verse 1: Ice Cube]   Lord have mercy, my people so thirsty   Come feed 'em, either Jesus or Mohammad   All we get is vomit, come like a comet   Put it in my brain Lord, put it in my stomach   Only you can do it, I'ma learn from it   Do what I gotta do, try not to plum it   America used to shoot like reptiles   Don't worry tomorrow, let's get this right now   They wanna run us in the ground   Educate yourself, before they dumb you down   Get your money boy, the legal way   Beat 'em with they own bullshit if you may   Now rich white men they got the world fucked up   Why should I give a fuck about a Styrofoam cup   Environmental saying, but if I go green   You know what I mean bitch      [Chorus]   Take me away from these people [Repeat: x4]      [Verse 2: Ice Cube]   Ice Cube for President, let's just do it for the hell of it   See how I run the government   Make money irrelevant   I might tell a chick, it's illegal to resell of it   Secret service don't know where the hell I went   Sorry yall, I had to fuck a super delicate   Dream ticket, Ice Cube and Obama   American dream, Ice Cube and yo mama   The Terminator, are you Sarah Conner?"
"The features of the setting in the story affect the cyclist by describing that he is in a desert-like area in Lodi, California. They say it is very hot and there is sand everywhere. There also aren’t many places to cool off at. They also described the water and Lodi to be about @NUM1 degree in temperature. The cyclist was trying to get to Yosemite to get away from the heat and to have a cool, shady pine trees to sit under, and cool fresh water.

"The setting of the short cut affected the cyclist in many ways. For example, he said there was rusty water, and ""it tasted like battery acid"" because of this he was not able to drink it which made him become dehydrated. Also in the story is says, ""flat roads were replaced by short rolling hills."" This could of made the journey even harder for the cyclist because now he had a little more effort to get up the hills one more example is towards the end he says ""i began breaking my ride down into distances, i could see the horizon telling myself i could make it there."" By the cyclist saying this it seems like he has given up and he realizes that this journey is going to never end untill he dies. That is how the setting on the story affected the cyclist..Are you prepared for the pretender?.Have I told you lately when I'm sleepin'   Every dream I dream is you somehow   Have I told you who I'd like to share my love forever   Well darlin' I'm telling you now   This heart would break in two if you refuse me   I'm no good without you anyhow   Dear have I told you lately that I love you   Well darlin' I'm tellin' you now..of love   Inside my skull   A million more lives   It's never dull   Just a few times spun   Spun around the sun   A couple more or less   And then we're done.Babe it's time to gather all the harvest, to pray before the winter and sail the heart shaped sea..Perfect   Yo girl flirtin cuz my chain perfect   Watch and ring perfect   Earrings perfect   She is misses perfect and I am mr.

"The features of the setting in Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit.” Affect the cyclist in many ways. First in the essay when the @CAPS1 says he is in the deserts of California, that can affect because it gives them an idea of how hot it most likely was out there and how lack of water can really harm someone. Also when the @CAPS1 describes the water pumps and what comes out o them, it can give the cyclist a feeling of disgust and remind them to always keep a good water supply..We got the freedom!.In a word..I am my Father's child, no enemy can touch me..So      [Chorus]      With little tin horns and little toy drums   Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums   Santa Claus is comin' to town   And curly head dolls that toddle and coo   Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too   Santa Claus is comin' to town   Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee   They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree   So!.Don't spit on my mind   Don't spit on my mind   Don't spit on my mind      We are the people, we are the masses you are for   We give the power and our desire must be your law   Don't think I'm standing here all alone, one of a kind   Don't think because you're still there   Means that we are all blind   Don't spit on my mind   Don't spit on my mind   Don't spit on my mind.Before it starts, before I begin?.Again it's around seven   I'm burning like a candlelight   I don't know where I'm going   But I'm ready for this night      You'd better run for cover   Before I start to smile   No way there's time for wasting   Never walk in a line   Never walk in a line   Oh yeah      And I just keep going   Forget these boring times   And I'm hungry for desire   No way to live in a line      You'd better run for cover   Before I start to smile   No way there's time for wasting   Never walk in a line      Reckless and mean I'm ruling the scene - I never get enough   Acting the night - I'm gone with the light - I can't   get enough   I never get enough      Again it's around seven   I'm burning like a candlelight   I don't know where I'm going   But I'm ready for this night      Reckless and mean I'm ruling the scene - I never get enough   Acting the night - I'm gone with the light - I can't   get enough      Reckless and mean I'm ruling the scene - I never get enough   Acting the night - I'm gone with the light - I can't   get enough   I never get enough"
"In  rough raod ahead by Joe Kurmaskie the feature of the setting affected the cyclist. Because he was in the desert of California in June, he water supply was emicated and he came across a ghost town. His hope was dwindling because of this. He found a water pump that produced a tar like substance as a result the desert and the lack of water made him wish he was dead he decided never to take advice from strangers and to trust his map. That is how the feature affected the setting..Nina simone, gilbert o'sullivan      I remember this afternoon   When my sister came into the room   She refused to say how my father was   But i knew he'd be dying soon..Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh      Drive fast, I can almost taste it now..Darlin', dearest darlin'   Always in my heart and in my thoughts   Darlin', dearest darlin'   Havin' loved you once I've never stopped..Too much near the truth they say   Keep it 'til another day   Let them have their little game   Delusion helps to keep them sane      Let them have their little toys   Matchbox cars and more kids joys   Exciting in their plastic ways   Frozen food in a concrete place      Your gonna go insane   I'm tryin' to save your brain      Alright!.Won't you come along with me   To the Mississippi   We'll take the boat to the land of dreams   Steam down the river down to New Orleans   The band's there to meet us   And old friends to greet us   Where all the people always meet   Heaven on earth they call it Basin Street   Basin Street is the street   Where the elite always meet   In New Orleans the land of dreams   You'll never know how nice it seems or just how much it really means   Glad to be oh yessiree   Where welcome's free are dear to me   Where I can lose   My Basin Street blues   Glad to be oh yessiree   Where welcome's free are dear to me   Where I can lose   My Basin Street blues   Ain't you glad you came with me   Way down to the Mississippi   We took the boat to the land of dreams   Steam down the river to New Orleans.In the world without me, this vision..I'm your go-go dancer,   Midnight answer,   Tupac sweetheart,   Queen of the night."
"The setting in “Do not exceed posted speed limit affects the cyclist in many ways. The old men told the cyclist there were flat roads on the path he was to take, when the cyclist got there, there were hills not flat roads. The cyclist traveled through the desert to get to his destination. He started to run out of water because it was so hot and humid. He started to get dehydrated and could bairly keep his balance. In this story the cyclist had to pass a large snake “a ridiculously large"" snake – it realy didn’t look like a diamondback – blocked a majority of the pavement in front of me “(Kurmaskie). The snake was big and the cyclist had to work his best to pass it while wobbling from dehydration. The settings in this story had effect on the cyclist in many ways..I left a woman waiting   I met her sometime later   She said, I see your eyes are dead   What happened to you, lover?.This is it   Here we go, we going to fly   Come and get it!.(He came into your apartment)   I don't know!.Sing me a lullaby.).What makes you say the things you want to say,   To make it a better day?.Say it right   We're bigger than this   Bigger than this stupid fight   Baby girl, we're bigger than this   Bigger than this      Staying mad at me, for eternity   What's that gonna be?.Are you still in school   Living up to expectations?"

" In this story the setting affects the cyclist in many ways. He tries to get directions but the people he asked really didnt know what they were talking about. Thats why you have to be careful on who you ask. Then he needs a drink but that dosent work out to well because the water ends up tasting like battery acid. Then the cyclist begins to be on his way again and finds same difficulty in the road. The same difficulty in the road. The road is in bad condition and must do slower then the speed limit.

"The cyclist pedaled through all types of different terrain. Through   hills, high desert, flat roads and the woods. This cyclist took the advice of bunch old men who thought they knew a short cut to the Yosemite national park. This short cut turned out to be a nightmare. The cyclist had only brought so many water bottles and was quickly drinking them all. The setting of this story changed a lot making the cyclist at   times have to pedal faster and slowes. The cyclist was quickly worn out and started to loose hope in himself. The  terrain kept changing making it  hard for him not to be thirsty. Eventually he drank all of his water and knew he would die of dehydration or a heat stroke.

"“Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” had a  rough setting between harzardous things and the death defying heat. The cyclist had to endure the pain of dehydration and determination. He had been given bad directions that almost caused him his life. He was travelling through a desert and claimed the temperature was @NUM1.Also, the cyclist had to ration his water because it was ghost towns in which our character passed through. He used nature skills he’d once learned and began to suck on pebbles which take the mind off thirst and uses saliva to help refresh your throat. Throughout his adventure everything kept this young man from getting water and to whenever there was water any faster. He had survived and wouldn’t ever take shortcuts again.Don't ever let it end..I was never afraid of danger, took trouble on the chin,   Mountains I have climbed, that have killed a thousand men,   Spent most of my lifetime downtown, sleepin' behind the wheel,   Never needed anybody, I was king of the hill..As close as today is to tomorrow   At midnight they can finally touch   'Cause every minute brings them that much closer   Closer      So on this silent night   I call your name   And suddenly all time and space disappears   I see your face in firelight      I hold you close in memory   And even though you're gone   I know you're here   As close as the glow is to the ember      You've always been a part of me   Now living in my heart you're even closer   Closer..I must've dreamed a thousand dreams   Been haunted by a million screams   I can hear the marching feet   They're moving into the street..Only you can see me..I bet you're wonderin' how I knew   'Bout your plans to make me blue   With some other guy you knew before   Between the two of us guys   You know I loved you more   It took me by surprise I must say   When I found out yesterday   Don't you know that I heard it through the grapevine   Not much longer would you be mine   Oh I heard it through the grapevine   Oh I'm just about to lose my mind      Honey, honey yeah..I've been struck by blindness      I close my eyes cause you've been gone   Such a long time I fantasize   You close so long fantasy   Began to see it altered my mind   Am I crazy?"
"The rider in the story “Rough Road Ahead” by Joe Kurmaskie has a very analyzing mind, which is affected by things around him. At first, the rider “rode into the morning...with a smile” because of the bright sun, and the “cool pines” and rushing rivers”...he is very confident with the old mens directions, this first sign of disapointment is when he comes to the “ramshackle shed...” And the “...sight of this was troubling...” to him, but he rode on. He thinks as he rides over the “crippling hills” that maybe this wasn’t such a great idea. Finally he comes to a old bait shop, and the “modern bathroom” that he enters to drink from, gives him relief from the desert he had just been riding through..They're ridin' on my back..Stop and listen, I hear my baby call my name   Stop and listen, I hear my baby call my name   She don't call too loud, but she calls, ooh, nice and plain      Stop and listen, before you make a start   Stop and listen, before you make a start   Because if you fall in love, it may break your heart      I love my baby, I'll tell the world I do   I love you, baby, I'll tell the world I do   And they'll just have to stop and listen to everything for you.And as an added bonus,   Your neighbor might be the proud recipions of that poison weed..Fuck!...But if you know where you're going..No matter where i go, you're always there,   No matter where i look, I feel your stare,   I thought it was forgotten, or at least forgiven,   You're gonna keep punishing me till the day i leave him."
"Some features of the setting affect the cyclist. First the cyclist followed the old codgers advice of how to get to Yosemite National Park. Their advice was no use and didnt help her in the end. Next, “a tarlike substance oozed out” of what she thoot was going to be water. Then the terrain changed to “short, rolling hills”, which wasnt helping, her bike better. Lastly, ""tumble weeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake”, slowed her down. All of these road blocks in the setting affected the cyclist..And bring us safe to bliss on high   Allelujah!.Ouh, il m'effraie!..Singing a song of angry men?.Fly, fly little wing   Fly beyond imagining   The softest cloud, the whitest dove   Upon the wind of heaven's love   Past the planets and the stars   Leave this lonely world of ours   Escape the sorrow and the pain   And fly again      Fly, fly precious one   Your endless journey has begun   Take your gentle happiness   Far too beautiful for this   Cross over to the other shore   There is peace forevermore   But hold this memory bittersweet   Until we meet      Fly, fly do not fear   Don't waste a breath, don't shed a tear   Your heart is pure, your soul is free   Be on your way, don't wait for me   Above the universe you'll climb   On beyond the hands of time   The moon will rise, the sun will set   But I won't forget      Fly, fly little wing   Fly where only angels sing   Fly away, the time is right   Go now, find the light.How is it going?.Well the train slipped into the station   A worn out steel blue soul   A relic from colonial days   When the French were still in control   Lorsque les Francais et tous jour en controle      It's an outpost in transition   Where the faithful in the bar   Know from the whistle and the squeaking wheels   That the next stop is Dakar   La prochaine etape etait Dakar      Talk on the radio   Talk on the street   Talk of men with money loco from the heat      Talk about the rail band   Picking up the beat   We lit that great reunion   With the headlights on the jeep      And there's history on the jukebox   Where the spies and scoundrels dwell   It was the place to go in Bamako   Direction Buffet Hotel   Direction Buffet Hotel      Now we're lost in the Sahara   Four hours north of Tombuktu   Lookin' for a nomad who knows   Or maybe some wondering Jew   Allons a Essakane, Syndou      Then we heard that Tuareg combo   We had come so very far   And we were welcomed out of history   By the wind the sand and the stars   Jai commence a le piercevoir      Sand in the couscous   Sand in the wine   There was sand in my guitar case   Stories in my mind      Machine guns on the hilltop   Camels in my tent   Buried in a sandstorm   As the music came and went      Well we crawled out of that desert   And the storm erased our tracks   The Sahara showed her heart to us   And then she took it back      We owned Buffet Hotel   Said, nous avons eu Buffet Hotel   Ce soir   Tu la monde      I recall diplomats and hookers   I saw strangers digging wells   And for that one great night in Bamako   We owned Buffet Hotel   Said, nous avons eu Buffet Hotel.My niqqa S bezzy keep my wrist brezzy why would I go hard when this shit is soo easy      (Nicki minaj chrous)   Yall be tryin haaard (But it's easy), tightin up on yo jooooob (Cause it's easy)."
"The essay “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” describes a man’s bicycle ride through California. Now, California is very hot during the summer, which is when the cyclist is riding. This setting greatly affects the man’s journey. It made it very difficult for him to finish his ride. He drank most of his water in the beginning of his ride so he gets very dehydrated. The text states, “The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips.” As you can see the setting makes this man’s bikeride very hard..I have never known a love like this,   Before in my life,   Tears can turn into bliss,   With only a kiss, only a kiss..Gave you all I had you tossed it in the trash   You tossed it in the trash you did   To give me all your love is all I ever had cause what   You don't understand is   I'd catch a grenade for ya   Throw my hands on a blade for ya   I'd jump in front of a train for ya   Yu know I'd do anything for ya      I would go through all this pain   Take a bullet straight through my brain   Yes I would die for ya baby   But you won't do the same   No, no, no, no   Black black black and blue beat till I'm numb   Tell the devil I said hey when you get back to where your from   Mad bad boy that's just what you are yeah   You'll smile in my face then rip the brakes out my car      Gave you all I had you tossed it in the trash   You tossed it in the trash yes you did   To give me all your love is all I ever had   Cause what you don't understand is I'd catch a grenade for ya   Throw my hands in a blade for ya   I'd jump in front of a train for ya   You know I'd do anything for ya   I would go through all this pain   Take a bullet straight through my brain   Yes I would die for ya baby   But you won't do the same      If my body was on fire   Ooh you'd watch me burn down in flames   You said you loved me you're a liar   Cause you never ever ever did baby      But darling I'd still catch a grenade for ya   Throw my hands on a blade for ya   I'd jump in front of a train for ya   You know I'd do anything for ya   I would go through all this pain   Take a bullet straight through my Brain   Yes I would die for ya baby   But you won't do the same   No you won't do the same   You won't do the same   Ooh you never do the same   No no no no.There's a constant contradiction, what feels good and what feels right..People you hate   Will get their hooks into you..Nobody's gonna wrap me 'round their finger..Wounded heart I cannot save you from yourself   Though I wanted to be brave it never helped   'Cause your trouble's like a flood ragin' through your veins   No amount of love's enough to end the pain   Tenderness and time can heal a right gone wrong   But the anger that you feel goes on and on   And it's not enough to know that I love you still   So I'll take my heart and go for I've had my fill   If you listen you can hear the angel's wings   Up above our heads so near they are hovering   Waiting to reach out for love when it falls apart   When it cannot rise above a wounded heart   When it cannot rise above a wounded heart.She does not walk, she runs instead   Down these jagged streets and into my bed      When I was fumbling through your dresser drawer   Forgot what I was looking for   Try to guide me in the right direction   Making use of all this time   Keeping everything inside   Close my eyes and listen to you cry      [Chorus]      There's only so much I can do for you   After all of the things you've put me through      [Chorus]"

" The features of the setting effect the cyclist in many ways. He becomes delusional when he said that  if he were lucky one of the stones would be lodged in his throat. Also he is dehydrated because he uses all of his water tend is having to push hard to make it to the next town..I walk the streets by day, I never know quite what to say   It doesn't matter anyway   Man of a 1000 faces, man of a 1000 faces, man of a 1000 faces, who's the man      For years I've lived inside my dreams   Somehow I've made them real, it seems   I made my own rules, because I am a      Man of a 1000 faces, man of a 1000 faces, man of a 1000 faces, who's the man      I can put on any face, you all know me, but it's no disgrace   The king of night, he understands      Man of a 1000 faces, man of a 1000 faces, man of a 1000 faces, who's the man   Who's the man of a 1000 faces, who's the man of a 1000 faces   Who's the man of a 1000 faces, who's the man      I'm the man, I'm the man, I'm the man, I'm the man   I'm the man of a 1000 faces, I'm the man of a 1000 faces   I'm the man of a 1000 faces, I'm the man   I'm the man, I'm the man, I'm the man, I'm the man (to fade).Ooo-whee, do it one more time for me!.He's proud of the scars and the battles he's lost   He struggles and bleeds as he hangs on the cross   And he likes to be known as the angry young man..The dope game hard,   The rap game easy,   This is round 1 of Gucci Man vs jeezy,   Gucci Mane vs jeezy,   This is round 1 of Gucci Man vs....(x 2).Some of the lads had never been away from home before   'Twas the first time Whacker put his foot outside of Inchicore   Before we left for Europe we knew we'd need a plan   So we all agreed that Joxer was the man to drive the van..And if you want her back it's a full attack   You give a little bit more..Its all gonna fade      Now I sit by my window   And I watch the cars   I fear I'll do some damage   One fine day   But I would not be convicted   By a jury of my peers   Still crazy   Still crazy   Still crazy after all these years"
" In the story “Do not exceed Posted Speed limit” a cyclist takes a journey through terrain to get to Yosemite. In that part of California there are not a lot of towns or people. The rode he is rideing on is very dangerous and long. It is very dry and hot out there but.The girl is on to you..I'll sing to the sun in the sky,   I'll sing till the sun rises high,   Carnival time is here,   Magical time of year,   And as the time draws near,   Dreams lift my heart!.I forgot about you last night   For the first time in a long time I Didddd   I was caught up in these drinks they keep on makin   In amazin conversation with this girl named lorraine   Who says she's from L.

"The setting affected the cyclist greatly throughout his ride. “The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips and the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke (pG @NUM1 kurmaskie).” This quote is saying that because of the heat, the rough terrain and the length of his “shortcut” his running out of water. That’s when he realizes he could die from heatstroke because he listened to a bunch of old men..I've seen it happen too many times   And just where it starts I don't know   You're traveling steady but you don't see the signs   That tell you there's a fork in the road   And you don't think it's right but you're both turnin' away   And the ending is always the same   When suddenly parallel lives drift apart   And there's no one accepting the blame   But girl you and I we got too much too lose   By one of us saying goodbye   And I see it clearly we're both meant to be   But you got that look in your eyes      [Chorus]   Don't go, don't go   Cause you might regret everything   When you wake up on your own   Oh no, I'm not lettin' go   And I never will surrender what we got together      Layin' beside you I can't sleep at all   Wonderin' what your thinkin' inside   Will I wake up and find that   You've made up your mind to   Go it alone for awhile   And don't say it's present when it's all in the past   You gotta stop lookin' behind   And take everything as it comes for today is   The first day of the rest of your life      [Chorus]      Don't go, oh never say goodbye, Don't go   Oh no, you got that look in your eyes   I've seen it before, you're gonna walk out that door      [Chorus: x2].There comes a time in everyone's life   When all of the parties every night   They're not enough   You want something more (Tell me)   I want you   I want you      (Tell)   (Tell)      I find you when I want you   And lose you late at night   The woman in me shouts out   The man in me just smiles   I may not always love you   You may not care   But if we should live together   There's something we could share   If we dare   Why don't we?.instead they turned against   Immortal man..Sowing the seeds of love, sowing the seeds,   sowing the seeds of love, sowing the seeds of love..(music gets you high)   It takes you on a ride, feel it when your body starts to rock   (when your body starts to rock)   Baby you can't stop   (baby don't stop),   And the music's all you got, come on now   This must be      [Chorus].Tell me,   (Tell me,).Edison's here to stay."
"The setting affected the cyclist because since it was the California desert, and it was in June, it was very hot and dry. Which caused him to get very thirsty and drink all his water. After almost all his water was gone, he began to get very tired, and since it is the desert, there isn’t any one around to help him if he dehydrates and blacks out, so he has to persevere and really push through the situation if he wants to survive. But he eventually finds a bait shop and he has a drink there so he is okay..Failing that   If you have to go   It's all up to me, I know   I just wanna change my world but from the inside   I just wanna live my life   And make this place, make this time   For all our lives to be respected   Here in the cold light of day, this vision   Paints a different world, a world of the heart   And I want to live there   I've been on the run from all the people I've become   I want to shed this skin and start it all again   I want to draw a line in the sand for one last time   Will you help me?.I swear..Twenty four hour party people   Plastic face can't smile the whites out   With the twenty four hour party people plastic face can't smiles the white out      I can see you through the door   You been chewing bread and water   And there's a grudge on you   You know you not ought not to have   You've been running around the racetrack   You've been running around the racetrack   Put that mudder to bed to bed   Put that mudder to bed      With the twenty four hour party people plastic face can't smile the whites out   Cause I have to wait for you to conduct   Press the pause of the self destruct   With the twenty four hour party people plastic face can't smile the whites out   With the twenty four hour party people      Now better you're the white out      I need full-time   I don't need part-time   I need 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7   3, 6, 5 all the time   I need 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 full time   I don't need a part-time   I need a 3, 6, 5      Oh no days off      Twenty four hour party people   Plastic face can't smile the whites out   I need 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7   3, 6, 5 all the time   I need 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 full time   I don't need a part-time   I need a 3, 6, 5.And I can't live in a fairytale of lies..Go fly a kite and tie your troubles to the tail   They'll be blown away by a merry gale,   Go fly a kite and toss your worries to the wind   And they won't come back, they'll be too chagrined..Can't cha feel the pulsation of my heart?.It's on!"
"In the story the setting has a large affect on the cyclist. After taking advice from old people he ended up in the desert with no cars, buildings, or peopl. He was running low on water and had no way of getting anymore, and he was really dehydrated, he got really tired and almost gave up because of the heat and lack of water. All this was caused by the setting he was in..[Intro]   Gonna cause a stink   Won't be the first to blink   I'm not who you think   Don't mess with me, I'm Boudicca      [Verse 1]   My husband Presotagus died   He was a Celtic king   I was his queen, so due to me   Was half of everything      [Verse 2]   Roman law gave half to me   So half was what they got   Till their nasty soldiers came   And took the blessed lot      [Verse 3]   Hey mister   I say you got the wrong end of the stick   His answer turned this sister   Into one angry chick!.Just leave me be   Just leave me   Just leave me be   Why you just leave me   Just leave me be   Why you just leave me   Just leave me be, oh      She, she don't touch me, I don't touch her   We rarely even ever say a word   I really want to give her everything she deserves   But the bad took away the good   She thinks that I'm full of it, arguments, always pissed, man I'm tired   Every kiss that I miss, girl you know I'm trying   You never believe when I say, and I never believe it when you say   I love you, and I shouldn't complain about it   I should take it like a man and walk up out it   Cause we will never be the same, oh   I've been standing in gas, and you have been the flame      [Chorus]   I know sorries just wouldn't do it   Her heart is obliterated, I'm trying to get through   Got to move this mountain   It's like moving mountains...

The first town also was empty and when saw the town he was excited to go and feel a little out when he got closer he realized that the town has been abandoned this whole time so he was forced to keep going out the empty town made him feel almost hopless.

"In the essay, “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” the unbearable setting effects the cyclist with its harsh conditions. At first, in the cyclist’s own words, “ things began well enough.” @CAPS1, this soon changes. The road is long and filled with obstacles and the cyclist has hardly any water to sip. He does not give up, @CAPS1, in the text it says, “got back on the bike, but not bothered gathered up a few peldder and stuck them in my mouth.” He does this in order to reduce his need for water and continues, ignoring the tall the setting brings upon him..You put the keys in the car and drive..A couple of the sound that I really like   Are the sounds of a switchblade and a motorbike   I'm a juvenile product of the working class   Whose best friend floats from the bottom of a glass.You're my little saviour   You're the one I sleep with at night   You take me in and promise me I'll be alright   You're my little angel down from the heaven above   I can't ask for much anymore,   But you still smile and give me your love   So if you fall asleep tomorrow,   Then I know we can make it through this night   But if you fall asleep as I hold you tight,   You'll have moved on,   Your love will be gone      You're my little saviour,   Hold me close and stare up into the stars   Let me know if you think that there's someone up there   Who still believes in us   After I've lost all their trust,   Just need someone to believe us   So please just fall asleep tomorrow,   'Cause sugar I know we can make it through the night   Cause if you fall asleep as I hold you tight   You'll have moved on, your love will be gone   You were my little saviour,   I was supposed to hold you through the night   But I guess I let you down inside...   You're my little saviour   I loved you.Its a good thing that I can't sleep   But I stay up all night a start to weep   Like a willow tree cought in the rain   I get that thought again and agian   I cloose my eyes but sece to dream   Like I lost time an empty steam   Of thoughts runnin through my head   And I wake and wish world was dead      Turn turnin in to sunlight   My skin don't burn as I fall fall in full flight   I bloom with flower   Soft the rain   I'm stern like a tower   Again and again   I cry   Cry with the wolves they stare   And I think am I really there      Walk down arond and around   The people talking but theres no sound   Climbing the mountain swimin the ocean   Cry but see nothing is there some solotion      Look down around   Why can't I fall into picture   No sound (no sound)   Is there any victor      Turn turnin in to sunlight   My skin don't burn as I fall fall in full flight   I bloom with flower   Soft the rain   I'm stern like a tower   Again and again   I cry   Cry with the wolves they stare   And I think am I really there      I live a life of hurt and pain   All wanta do is the chain   Yeah yeah think about it   People only stop to spit   I'm out to steal I don't deserve   Round the bend I drop the curve      Turn turnin in to sunlight   My skin don't burn as I fall fall in full flight   I bloom with flower   Soft the rain   I'm stern like a tower   Again and again   I cry   Cry with the wolves they stare   And I think am I really there.Today, a savior,   Tonight, I am the new messiah you deify..Fires burning can you hear   Cries in the night..I guess I'm just a sucker in the dream factory, oh!"
"The features in the setting affect the cyclist in many different ways. One way is he is round stuck with only a little bit of water. “The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips.(Kurmaskie). Also the cyclist was lost because of the old men directions that got him know where because there directions were out of date. “Never accept travel advice from a collection of old-timers who haven’t left the confine of their porches since carter was in office,” (Kurmaskie @NUM1). He was giving bad directions and wasnt to pleased. Therefore the cyclist went through some though times..It was just my imagination   Runnin' away with me..Night and stars above that shine so bright   The mystery of their fading light   That shines upon our caravan..Jaden: Yeah   Will: You can talk right now though   Jaden: OK. How you gonna warm up?.Yeah yeah yeah..You called me up on the phone today   Struggling with the right words to say..I'm just a creature of habit   In a complicated world..It's the sound of letting go."
"The setting affected the cyclist a lot. One way was the heat. It got so hot that he was becoming dehydrated. He kept drinking his water, until he didnt have any left. Another reason is because the road turned into hills which made him use more energy. Finally, it didn't help that he hadnt seen any sign of living creatures except for a snake @CAPS1 how the setting affected the cyclist..She said she comes from ice land....Unto us God's Son came nigh,   Hallelujah!.See where I was wounded,   Remember the scar ?.'Cause I'm tired of thinkin', and too much drinkin', all my troubles away..[Dolly:]   You're next, Mr. Tucker!.I do not   Understand   What it is   I've done wrong   Full of holes   Check the pulse   Blink your eyes   One for yes   Two for no      I have no idea what I am talking about   I'm trapped in this body and can't get out   Oh      Make a sound   Move back home   Get an invitation   With the edges   Sawn off      I have no idea what you are talking about   I'm trapped in this body and can't get out   Oh      Has the light gone out for you?.I am a poor, wayfaring Stranger   Traveling through this world alone   There's no sickness, toil or danger   In that bright land, to which I go   I'm going there to see my mother   I'm going there no more to roam   I'm only going over Jordan   I'm only going over home now      (Hey-ey-ey yeah...)

"The features of the setting affect the cyclist because there is mo water, hills, and deserts. When the cyclists saw water a wanting to jump in all he thought about was water that they lack like battery acid.Then the hills slowed him down from the water. The desert just made him want water even more. That are some features of the settings that affected the cyclist..And now the purple dusk of twilight time      Steals across the meadow of my heart      High up in the sky the little stars climb      Always reminding me that we're apart      You wander down the lane and far away      Leaving me a song that will not die      Love is now a stardust of yesterday      The music of the years gone by      Sometimes I wonder why I spend      The lonely nights dreaming of a song      The melody haunts my reverie      And I am once again with you      When our love was new      And each kiss an inspiration      But that was long ago      Now my consolation      Is in the stardust of a song      Beside the garden wall      When stars are bright      You are in my arms      The nightingale tells his fairy tale      Of paradise where roses bloom      Though I dream in vain      In my heart it will remain      My stardust melody      The memory of love's refrain.You say why?.Don't keep me waiting (Hey, hey, hey, hey!).I heard an echo but the answer had changed   From the word I remembered   That I started out sayin'   Living is cheating if you're not pulling oars   The current is leaving   I'll get mine   You get yours      Don't know where I'm going I just keep on rowing   I just keep on polling, gotta row   Don't know where I'm going I just keep on rowing   I just keep on polling, gotta row      Hey!.Then the Lord God hunted through the wide night air,   For the little dark star on the wind down there,   And He stated and promised He'd take special care   So it wouldn't get lost again..You say you can't believe, believe that it's true   Let the spellbinder put a spell on you.Here comes the wise man   And there goes the fool   You see that burnt out world that he is living in   I don't need to look for the rules   Here comes the donkey   Chained to a ten ton plough   He'll never make that hill in a million years   Whip crack beating down      He loves his brother but he'd sell him for a fistful of gold   He needs a slave for his vision of the promised land   No I don't believe a word   Take me any way the wind blows   You'll never know just what you want to do   Or where you want to go i think it's time   That you found what the world is waiting for   I think it's time To get real      Here comes the wise man   And there goes the fool   You see that burnt out world that he is living in   I don't need to look for the rules      Here comes the donkey   Chained to a ten ton plough   He'll never make that hill in a million years   Whip crack beating down      Anytime you want it then it's there   All you gotta do is stop it   On the corner and ask   Say hey you don't live today   Stop the world   Stop the world   I'm getting off   I'm getting off   Can't get enough   I'm getting off"
"The author think that the setting means he is not getting any closer to his destination. However, he found out that there was still people around. He paniced and thought he was going to die. The places were desserted and he thought the lead nowhere. He was a little scared at the fact he might die because of everything around him was in a sense dead..Don't try to ask me why,   she set my soul on fire,   oh my Ko Ko Blue,   oh my Ko Ko Blue..Levolor, left me in the dark..It's just impossible      And tomorrow, should you ask me for the world   Somehow I'd get it, I would sell my very soul   And not regret it for to live without your love   Is just impossible      Can the ocean keep from rushing to the shore?.She got a bad big record on the heartbreak radio..I don't know, girl, you've been around..He shall be Levon..Just last year   We wandered here   And dreamed a dream   That never would die."
" The setting affected the cyclist because of the rode conditions. The rode was all messed up. .Bangin' headboards, the loud noise, the sound of you screamin'..(B-e-t don't make desions what you bad.).What?.And if you ever saw him,   you would even say it glows..He saw it all   He walked the line   Never had to crawl   He cried a bit   But not for long   Hell yeah   He found the life that he was after   Filled it up with love and laughter   Finally got it right   And made it fit   Hell yeah he did!.The way that I did   I gave him the means to the end   Yes I did   I bothered not to believe in this way   The way that I did   I made him just to see in this way   The way that I did      I need   I don't ask much anymore   I found something.As I leave behind Neidin   In the hall where we have been   Rhododendrons in your hair   In the mountain scented air   I still feel her spirit song   Cross the silver tear   Won't you remember?"
" Many things in the setting affect the cyclist. The first thing that affects him is the heat. The heat is actually what causes the conflict in the story of the cyclist needing water. If the heat was not present in the story than the cyclist would not have such a need for water and he would be able to continue on his ride without fear of dehydration. Another aspect of the setting that affect the cyclist are the rolling hills. These hills also exhaust the cyclist and cause him to need more water. If these hills were gone than the cyclist would have tirerd less quickly making his journey easyer. The setting in this story greatly affects the cyclist..And I believe I got it made..How does it feel?...But first, well, there's just one thing   We've, we've got to do   You know, we've got to do      Well, first let's set all people free   First let's set all, no matter color or creed   No matter if a mixed breed      Say people, ay, are you ready?.Blue eyed dressed for every situation   Moving through the doorway of a nation   Pick me up and shake the doubt   Baby I can't do without      [Chorus:]   Move out, don't mess around   Move out, you bring me down   Move out, how you get about   Don't make a sound just move out      I remember only for an hour   Move right through me can you feel the power   I don't know what's going on   It scares me but it won't take long      [Chorus]      Now he's in control he is my lover   Nations stand against him he's your brother   Been a long time, been a long time now   I'll get to you somehow      [Chorus].To me now!.Bright before me the signs implore me   Help the needy and show them the way."

"The feature of the cyclist and the settings arn’t that good. There’re insidents that are a problem. One is the bad weather. There is a tempature that makes it feels pretty close to @NUM1 degrees. He stops at a water pump, water comes out but it is really not cool. He takes two little sips and its like battarey acid. If he would to drink alot of that water it would probably kill him or make him very ill. He needs something because there was another town @NUM2 miles down the road so he has to find something to keep him going. As he is going down the road he sees a sign: Rough Road Ahead: Even though he is going 12 mph he could still hit a hole and go flying over his handle bars. If he does go over his handle bars he could run into the snake he saw then get eaten by the birds because he wouldn’t have any energic to get up.

"Heat, dry, flat - all are features of the setting that effected the cyclist. As the cyclist was driving through the desert, he noticed how hot it was, and how he would become dehydrated quickley. I was also very dry and and he started to get nervous about how thirsty he was. The flat ground models how there is nothing around that can help the cyclist, which made him scared. The story also metions that he is a ghost town....Along about eighteen twenty-five   I left Tennessee very much alive   And I never would have gotten through the Arkansas mud   If I hadn't been a-ridin that Tennessee stud      I had some trouble with my sweetheart's pa   And one of her brothers was a bad outlaw   I sent her a letter by my Uncle Fud   And I rode away on the Tennessee stud      Chorus:   The Tennessee stud was long and lean   The color of the sun and his eyes were green   A-He had the nerve and he had the blood   And there never was a hoss like the Tennessee stud      We drifted on down into no man's land   We crossed that river called the Rio Grande   I raced my hoss with the Spaniard's foal   Till I got me a skin full of silver and gold      Me and the gambler we couldn't agree   We got in a fight over Tennessee   We jerked our guns, and he fell with a thud   And I got away on the Tennessee stud      The Tennessee stud was long and lean   The color of the sun and his eyes were green   A-He had the nerve and he had the blood   And there never was a hoss like the Tennessee stud      Well I got just as lonesome as a man can be   A-Dreaming of my girl in Tennessee   The Tennessee stud's green eyes turned blue   Cause he was a-dreamin' of his sweetheart, too      We loped right back across Arkansas   I whoop her brother and I whoop her pa   When I found that girl with the golden hair   And she was A-ridin' that Tennessee mare (whoa, boy)      The Tennessee stud was long and lean   The color of the sun and his eyes were green   He had the nerve and he had the blood   And there never was a hoss like the Tennessee stud      Stirrup to stirrup and side by side   We crossed them mountains and the valleys wide   We came into Big Muddy then we forded a flood   On the Tennessee mare and the Tennessee stud      There's a pretty little baby on the cabin floor   A little hoss colt playin' 'round the door   I love the girl with golden hair   And the Tennessee stud loves the Tennessee mare (They'se good hosses)      The Tennessee stud was long and lean   The color of the sun and his eyes were green   And he had the nerve and he had the blood   And there never was a hoss like the Tennessee stud.Of Word, Inc.), Shepherd Boy Musicascap (adm.

"The features of the setting affects the cyclist because the worst the features get the more he wants water. For example, in the essay it said at some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculous large snake blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me when I think of tumbleweeds I think of dryness because it is like dry grass and when I think of snakes I think of heat because that is the time for snakes to come out when ot gets hot. So the cyclist was thinking about dryness of his throat and the dryness of his sorrounding making him want water. Another feature is when he seen a sandblasted picture of a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth probably making the cyclist wishing he could have that cold refreshing drink..Well you ran away and left me   And I love you still   Lucille, please come back where you belong   Lucille, please come back where you belong   I've been good to you baby   Please don't leave me alone   Well, I woke up this morning, Lucille was not in sight   I asked her friends about her but no, all their lips were tight   Lucille, baby satisfy my heart   Lucille, baby satisfy my heart   I'll be good to you baby   And give you such a wonderful start   Well, I woke up this morning, Lucille was not in sight   I asked her friends about her but no, all their lips were tight   Lucille, please come back where you belong   I've been good to you baby   Please don't leave me alone   Lucille, won't you do your daddy's will?.Move along big twenty, big twenty move along   You've got a master and you've got a home   Move along big twenty big twenty move along   You've got the muscle and you've got the bone      Went out on the Mojave with a twenty mule team   Ten tons of borax and a muleskinners dream   We'll soon be a-winin' and a-dinin' I know   With a cute little filly in the town of Reno      The Apaches are restless there's smoke in the sky   But I'm too old for scalpin' and I'm too young to die   But they'll soon be around us like ants on a hill   Bringin' this muleskinner up for the kill   (Here's where I can't remember much)      My mules started runnin' bring big twenty down   But we're still a-livin' so the story can be told   How I traded that borax for Apache gold.Whoa Oh   Can you blame me?.Gonna do what you do..We were kids just foolin' with lovin'   You took me in, and you didn't even know me or my games..May I come along?.They hide in their movie theaters   Drinking juice, keeping tight,   Watch that bright light."

One way that the features affect the cyclist, is that it is summer time, and it harder for the cyclist because.To end things watching everything spin..In the midst of life we are in debt etc..Lifting weights of conscious..They dealin', they dealin', they dealin'   The trap bugs, they gon' make a killin'   Got money all under the matrice   And hundreds, they all in the ceiling   I'm fucking now all of the' bitches   I'm make 'em do all of me business   I make 'em make all of my playz   I make 'em do all of my dealin'      [Hook:]   Yo baby daddy buy the shit from me?.Oh what have I done?.Electric Uncle Sam      You beg me please on bended knees not to sit among these enemies..Some of you sitting there with your cock in your hand   Don't get you nowhere don't make you a man   I heard something 'bout my Ma and my Pa   They didn't want me so they made me a star      I, I found out!"
"The features of the setting affected the cyclist in positive and negative ways. At first, there were the two old men who gave the cyclist the out-of-date information. They affected him negatively because if it wasn’t for them, the cyclist would have never gotten lost. When the cyclist arrived at the first town, the water pump affected him, the cyclist was running out of water and the water from the water pump tasted like battery acid and was about @NUM1°. The cyclist was becoming more and more dehydrated and the small, rolling hills didn’t help his dehydration, he also used a lot of energy in order to go over the hills. Finally, he found Gary and Wilber’s fish camp where he was able to get water. This whole experience in a way, affected the cyclist positively even though, at the time, he was affected negatively. The cyclist learned to not take advice from really old people who “haven’t left the confines of their porches since Carter was in office.” The cyclist was affected positively and negatively by the features of the setting..If what you're lookin' for is real love then   What you see is what you get..You told me all i would need was a little time   But getting over you is still such an uphill climb   I know i ought to be living in the present tense   But the past i had with you was the last time   My life made sense      [Chorus:]   Call me crazy-for hurting this way   Call me crazy-go on and say   It's a phase i'm going through   Call me crazy-crazy over you      I know you don't really mean to be so unkind   But pardon me if i'm not in the right frame of mind   To go on hearing how i should start all over again   Face the future without you-   I wouldn't know how to begin      (repeat chorus)   Bridge:   You say I'm lost in a fantasy   But what we had was real to me   Call me crazy      Go on and say   It's a phase I'm going through   Call me crazy-crazy over you   Call me crazy.Now I know I must leave your spell   I want tomorrow..[Verse 1]   Donely float got in the way   You are the feel, and knew it anyway   Take a chance, it wasn't what you know   Take my hand, and don't let go      [Chorus]   Oh, ooh ooh   You can do it,   Don't break   Yeah, you'll pull through it,   You're safe!.Moral demise..For all I know is nothing's changed   Nothing ever will if I don't leave this place   For all I know, you're waiting for me to whisper your name   What I wouldn't give to kiss your sweet face      Cause all I know is I need you here   And all I have, I would give away so I could say this dear   All I feel, oh I tried so hard to not feel   It's killing me      For all I know, you forgot me   For all I know, you're different, completely   And everything we had was never what I thought it was   But for all I know, oh it was love..I will never be your   Unemployed boyfriend"
"In the short story, “Do not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” The cyclist experiences some difficult times. When starting the journey he had very little water.

"In the story “Do not exceed posted speed Limit”, the cyclist is trying to get to Yosemite with directions that some codgers, or eccentric old men, gave him. The cyclist, said the old men looked as though they, “haven’t left the confines of their poaches since carter was in office. “  Well, he takes their advice, and he gets lost about @NUM1 along on his journey. While looking forward to the “Cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite”’ he was traveling through a barren desert. “There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind.” This type of setting could really bring down a cultist’s mood while thinking of Yosemite. It could make him lose all hope of ever finding Yosemite at this rate. If you have a nice setting, it makes the trip worthwhile, and your ending point even better..I'm lying to myself   And this dagger is my excuse   I'm a pawn   I should have paid up   And I left an hour late   I was laid up      I must abuse myself   I'm against all that I've made up   Set in stone the sun will come   And I hate light   You know I hate light   To me it looks so pretty burning      Burn the sun   Burn the light   Take take take take take take it away   Take my hand   Take my life   Take take take take take take it away      I must have caught something   In the heat of all these dances   I'm a worm with no more chances   And I've lost all doubt   In a chemical romance      I can't stop itching   Over thoughts of tarnished hope   Kinda funny   Lonely feeling   I'm not in love   You know it's not love   Don't make it look so pretty burning      Burn the sun   Burn the light   Take take take take take take it away   Take my hand   Take my life   Take take take take take take it away      Burn the sun   Burn the light   Take take take take take take it away   Take my hand   Take my life   Take take take take take take it away      Brothers and sisters   I'm right here with you   Cause everyone's got one   A story to to kill me   I'm so apathetic in my resentment   Living, loving, knowing not      Take my hand(x8)   Take my life   Take my heart take my mind   Take my life take my life      Burn the sun burn the light   Take take take take take take it away   Take my hand take my life   Take take take take take take it away   Burn the sun burn the light   Take take take take take take it away   Take my hand take my life   Take my life   Take my life.There is a house down in New Orleans   They call the Rising Sun   And it's been the ruin for many a poor boy and me   Oh God, I'm one   My mother was a tailor   She sowed these old blue jeans   My father was a gambler, Lord   Down in New Orleans   The only thing a gambler needs   Is a suitcase and a trunk   And the only time he's ever satisfied   Is when he's on a drunk   Go tell my baby sister   Not to do the the things I've done   Outshine that house down in New Orleans   That they call the Rising Sun   There is a house down in New Orleans   That they call the Rising Sun   And it's been the ruin for many a poor boy and me   Oh God, I'm one.Don't you worry..Baby tell me what you're trying to prove   Playing games with my heart   Hey now listen, I ain't gonna take one more night   You're the one who broke the rules   And I'm the one who played the fool   Now you're trying to tell me it's alright   You should know better than to hurt a friend   You'll never get another chance again      You'll be back where you started   I know you won't admit it but you're broken-hearted   Back where you started   You think it's gonna be easy but it just gets harder, harder      You had a way with words   One look and I was under your spell   I didn't know should I stay or should I run   You can't deny you told me lies   Love 'em and leave 'em baby, that's your style   I'm not afraid to take life as it comes   You play with fire I guess you'll never learn   You mess with me babe, you 're gonna get burned      You'll be back where you started   I know how it feels when you've been discarded   Back where you started   You think you got it made but it won't get you far, no it won't get you far      Who's gonna help ya, throw you a lifetime   I'll tell you one thing, you've really done it this time   You took your one chance and let it slip away.These are the days of evil perfection   This is the world of torture and fame   This is the age of most vicious infection   These are the times of terror and pain      Let them inside and they build you a nightmare   Show them, you fool, it'll not be in vain   Here is your costume of deepest surrender   These are the times of terror and pain      I want to ride on a crest of sensation   I want to scream in the whirlpools of love   I want to drown in a climax of thunder   I want to be with the fools in the storm      Do what you want and then die when you want to   We're gonna walk on the blood of the meek   We're gonna sail through the oceans of wonder   We're gonna live in the dreams that we seek      Send in the parasite clowns on their horses   Send in the idiots and let them advance   Send in the monsters of your own creation   Send them all in and give them a chance      We're gonna dance to the sweetest of music   We're gonna play with the whores in the rain   We'll dissipate the lord's last temptations   All in a crossfire of torture and fame.There must be a reason why..Hold tight to your heart's desire, never ever let it go."

"Each area the author entered changed what he felt and experienced. At first, he is lent courage by his surroundings. When he passes through the first town, abandoned and empty, he is still confidant he can go on sparred by the lush green trees and the cool rivers around him that belied the hot sun overhead. They are basically the reason he continued to go on. Later on during his trek through the desolated empty desert, his bleak surroundings make him feel hopelessness as well as despair.

He said with each passing landmark, “I eased past trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state.”  @CAPS1 that the more he went on the more the desert affected him and dehydrated him..No more under the quilt   To keep you warm..The Reel in the Flickering Light   By Christy Moore      As I was walking home one evenin'   I know this takes some believin'   I met a group of creatures   With the strangest lookin' features      A poor old dove and a worm in the weed   And a fine old pigeon, yes indeed   A daddy longlegs jumpet sprite   As he danced to the reel in the flickering light   Oh round we go, heel to the toe   And the daddy longlegs jumpet sprite   As he danced to the reel in the flickering light      On his thin and wispy spindles   He was deft and he was nimble   His eyes were scientific   And his dancing was terrific      And the rats and worms they made a din   And the nettles in the corners took it in   ""Oh God"" says I, ""Tonight's the night""   ""We'll dance to the reel in the flickering light""   Oh round we go, heel to the toe   ""Oh God"" says I ""tonight's the night   We'll dance to the reel in the flickering light""      Then he looked at me directly   With a gaze that could dissect me   Then he asked me in a whisper   ""Have you got any sisters?"".There's no business like show business and I tell you it's so   Traveling through the country is so thrilling, standing out in front on opening nights   Smiling as you watch the theater filling, and there's your billing out there in lights      There's no people like show people, they smile when they are low   Angels come from everywhere with lots of jack, and when you lose it, there's no attack   Where could you get money that you don't give back?.And it left him on a Utah road..'cause sooner or later there's gonna be a showdown ,   Gotta go man, gotta go..[Chorus:]   Why don't you wake up   And stop what you're doing right now?.The cake is all gone."
"There were many land features that affected the cyclist and his trip. First of all, it is a desert, which greatly affects him as there is no water in deserts. There was also a snake, which could have bit and kiiled him. As the road were not very well paved and had obviously been abandoned for years it made cycling much harder for him. And the juice factory just taunted him, making him remember his need for water, as did the well that did not pump cold water, but instead pumped hot,gross water.When I get to the bottom I go back to the top of the slide   Where I stop and I turn and go for a ride   'Til I get to the bottom and I see you again      Do you or don't you want me to love you   I'm coming down fast but I'm miles above you   Tell me tell me tell me the answer   You may be a lover but you ain't no dancer      Helter skelter   Helter skelter   Helter skelter      Will you want you want me to make you   I'm comin' down fast but don't let me break you   Tell me tell me tell me the answer   You may be a lover but you ain't no dancer      Helter skelter, look out      She's coming down fast   Yes she is, yes she is.You know I'll think about you,   Let me know you think about me, too..Two young lovers meet and take each others hand   They say I do in the name of the lord   Livin' as one givin' all they can   Then the pressures come and a child is born   Young girl cradles the child in her arms   The man's home late and his day's too long   They're both unable to spend some time alone   That everybody needs to have   That's the thing that keeps love strong      [Chorus]   Love don't always come easy   And sometimes love it can hurt   Words don't always come easy   It's worth a try we're gonna make it work   'cause love don't always come easy      Without warning many go a different way   And travel that road lookin' for someone   Their lives unravel a little more every day   This ain't no time to turn and run   It's a crime to throw it all away      [Chorus].Chorus:   Rah rah rah,   Sis boom fuckin' blah   There's a party in your honour, but you won't be there whatever, so,   Three cheers for the one that got away,   You were just blah blah blah,   I was oh my god,   And unlike your anatomy,   I'm glad I had it in me,   Now The King,   The King,   The King,   The King is dead,   But The Queen is alive (repeat)      Second verse:   I guess the village didn't raise you right,   Don't think nobodies gonna mourn you tonight,   No more licks to wet your appetite,   You make me sick I didn't wanna fight,   I thought we ruled the heavens in the earth,   I really thought I was the only girl,   Your secrets have all been revealed to me,   You've been dethroned there goes your legacy      Chorus   Rah rah rah,   Sis boom fuckin' blah   There's a party in your honour, but you won't be there whatever, so,   Three cheers for the one that got away,   You were just blah blah blah,   I was oh my god,   And unlike your anatomy,   I'm glad I had it in me,   Now The King,   The King,   The King,   The King is dead,   But The Queen is alive (repeat)      Third verse:   There are consequences in this life,   A punishment that fits the crime,   Your last words, I heard I'm sorry,   Now look at me in all my glory,      The King is dead but the queen is alive,   I wear your crown and I look quite nice,   I almost let you get the best of me   But no ones ever gonna get the queen..I can't live up, I can't let down   And leave you falling to pieces..I said ""No place special ?"".I got so low down,   Fed up, my God,   I could hardly move."

" The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. One of the ways are that it is affecting him is that the discription of it makes it seem hotter then what it really is.

"The different settings of the cyclist affected him by how he felt when he rode the bike on the rode. He was well excited and happy that he is going on the ride and how he truly felt about how he rode the bike real fast through the short cut. And how he came over a long, crippling hill he was riding real fast. So unfortunately he was riding fast non stop and how he came through the whole road with relief. He felt so free and how he when he came over hills that are tall and large. But he mostly believed he could find his way at the end. He said it himself he always stuck in the future. So he’s keeping his future and his wisdom to himself. He thought he was gonna die but all he had to do is ask for a little push. But different things did affect the cyclist by doing the impossible of his very bright future..At the end of it all   We will be sold for parts   We will try to rebuild   But we ate it all away   All ambitions now run dry   Someone stop this thing, turn it off   In search of new life   Nothing will be left to walk this earth again   Turn it off      Our hopes and dreams   Will be swallowed   We always said it wouldn't end up like this   We will be the new ice age   We will be the new plague   Disguised as a colony   We will wipe them all away   Feast your eyes   Or just rip 'em out   This is it for us   It's time to panic   We always said it wouldn't end   It wouldn't end up like this   We are the cancer   We are the virus   Tell me it's not too late.Pretty woman give your smile to me..Crying so long, over you......And she cries for herself without a lover..Truth or dare, I don't care, tell the truth I dare you..Many times I've been told by the wise and the old   Something good I'm supposed to remember   If my first love I'll found in, in the warm of July   It'll cool in the, in the nip of September   Now they point to the skies   To the old and wise   And they speak of a chill in the air   But I don't care   Oh, still I love my summertime love   Still I love the kissing and the codding   Still I love my summertime love   With a heart still summertime true   Still I love my summertime love   Still I want her walking close beside me   Still I love my summertime love   Let the seasons change as they do   Oh, still I love my summertime love   Still I love the kissing and the codding   Still I love my summertime love   With a heart still summertime true"

"The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. Ranging from temperature, surroundings, and the availability of water. First of all, the cyclist felt tired and exhausted because of the temperature and terrain, For example, “I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.” I can imagine the cruelty of the heat beating down on him while riding down the roads. It would make me tired and exhausted also. Second of all, the surroundings as he rode affected him and made him have less confidence as he rode further. For example, “This place might have been a thriving little spetatore time say, before the last world war-last on that morning it fit the traditional definition of a ghost town.” It shows how the information he had been giving caused him to feel unsure of where he was going. I’d feel uncapable and would do the same in his situation. Lastly, the lack of water made him scared. For example, “conserve my water and go instead for an hour or so a lest of my inner spirit.” It made him think the situation wasn’t good. So as one can see, it affected the cyclist in many ways..In the giving of my eyes to see your face..wrong!.I spent most of my life outside, in the driving rain   I was only trying to get by with some of life's amenities   Well, nothing's free, I got more than I bargained for   Now it's plain to see, I can't depend on love to defend me   It took most of my time to do what never was done   I was on the outside of an inside kind of love that now is gone   Come right or wrong, it was laid to rest that way   I hate to be unkind, pretending is for strangers who don't know you   I spent most of my life outside in the driving rain   I was in some one-horse town just waiting for a plane   To take me back now where's that at, I paid the price   Well, ain't that nice, knowing I'm so free?.Big Sky's too occupied,   Though he would like to try,   Then he feels bad inside..Said it's mighty strange, without a doubt,   Nobody knows you when you're down and out..Some kind of monster....Do ya thang, man   Fuck what they lookin' at!"

"The cyclist is dehydrated. He has lack of water for a significant distance before he realizes “that the old men would have been right,had he been riding,” before the last word war.” But any “town” he rode into, was just a run down, deserted, and abandoned piece of desert. He says,“It was a sad, hopeless, laugh, mind you, but at leas I still had the energy to feel sorry for myself.” @CAPS1 that he was getting more and more dehydrated, but was not quite ready to die. He still had enough energy to keep going, But “hope was fading.” Then all at once after climbing a large hill he gains all hope back. He sees “Gary and Wilber’s fish camp” The rider is safe now, he stumbles into the modern looking bathroom and drinks from the sink.

"In the story “Do not exceed posted speed limit” by Joe Kurmaskie there were many things that effected the cyclist. Such as the water. He had no really good water to drink because of where he was''. When I tryed a drop or two, it had the flavor of battery acid''. He wasnt able to drink the water because the battery acid'' that was in it could have made him very sick. Also the unstable roads that he had to bike through made things hard. ''Rough roads ahead'' To ride on unstable ground can be very hard to do. So just these two examples, the water and Rough roads made the features of the setting deffinitly effect the cyclist..Alone is all I feel..It must be love, I'm feeling   This must be love   Oh this must be love, I'm feeling   This must be love      Well I wait in every day, just in case,   You decide to call   And I can hardly wait,   'Coz I never thought time could pass so slowly      It must be love, I'm feeling   This must be love   Oh this must be love, I'm feeling   This must be love      Happiness is something I never thought I'd feel again,   But now I know   It's you that I've been looking for   And day by day more and more   I know what you think, you've heard it before   Don't tell me I know   But this feeling inside my heart,   You know I'm never letting go   Cause I think that      It must be love, I'm feeling   This must be love   Oh this must be love, I'm feeling   This must be love      Words can only say so much   It's hard to express   The things you do to me   You're everything I could've ever dreamed you'd be      This must be love, I'm feeling   This must be love   Oh this must be love, I'm feeling   This must be love.Why must you live out the songs that you wrote?.After all festivities the guests must depart..She said, ""You've got your problems and I have mine tonight."".Don't you need my love,..

" The setting affects the cyclist in many ways. The setting affects the cyclist because the weather is very hot and humid which makes him sweat which is using up energy because his body is trying to stay cool. Also the setting affects the cyclist because there is no water so on top of sweating being out of energy he has no water to refuel his body which makes it very hard for him to keep going..And there isn't any name that I can't rhyme   Now do Divi!.Is that what you always wanted to be,   Well I'd be worried for you..Where have you been, all my life?.So Mr. DJ I hope you've already made your segue   Or the FCC is gonna take a shit right on your head      Can't play this song on the radio (can't play this song)   Can't play this song on the radio (can't play this song).Here's to you, and your voice on the juke box!.Does it inspire?.A belief that time is cruelty."

"The settings affect the cyclists for many reasons. One, if the setting is nice, the rider can concentrate on the scenery not on only pain they are having. also, if the setting isn’t very nice, the rider would probably concentrate more on the pain than they would the scenery. another thing is if the setting is very hilly & the rider has to drive over it, it @MONTH1 not feel the greatest. The cyclist would get even more pain than before plus the cyclist could could get dehydrated faster, the setting really does affect the cyclist..Except for the Farmer's Market   And I still can hear him say:   You're all just pissin' in the wind   You don't know it but you are..I sleep between the gates of night, in a no man's land   Always closer than you think, a kind of your best friend   I have no religion and I have no flag   I don't care if you're wrong or right   Lilac skinned or black      I'm a cosmopolitician   Closer than your next of kin   Angel, devil of the night   And the seed of everything      And if your world has turned to ashes   I will leave you never   Even when the sun's blown out, I will shine forever   I caress you with my charms   I'm your best friend, the dream   I'm the light that guides you through the nights   And deepest haze      I'm a cosmopolitician...

"The features of the setting affect the cyclist because it is hard to go far on a bike when the place, you are ridding is dry, abandoned, a quiet, hot cold and straight forward.

This would make it hard for a cycler because you need a good water supply and thats hard to keep when there is nothing around..Wake up, Maggie I think I got something to say to you   It's late September and I really should be back at school   I know I keep you amused, but I feel I'm being used   Oh, Maggie, I couldn't have tried any more   You led me away from home   Just to save you from being alone   You stole my heart, and that's what really hurts      The morning sun, when it's in your face really shows your age   But that don't worry me none in my eyes, you're everything      I laughed at all of your jokes   My love you didn't need to coax   Oh, Maggie, I couldn't have tried any more      You led me away from home   Just to save you from being alone   You stole my soul, and that's a pain I can do without..I'm working in, I'm working hard for the best of it..am I losing your memory or mine?.Like the left behind colors in the sky   When the sun is gone..Old black magic has me in its spell   Old black magic that you weave so well   Those icy fingers up and down my spine   The same old witch craft when your eyes meet mine   Same old tingle that I feel inside   Then the elevator starts it ride      Down and down I go   Round and round I go   Like a leaf caught in a tide   I should stay away but what can I do   I hear your name and I'm a flame      Flame, flame of desire   Only your kiss can put out the fire   Oh you're the lover I have waiting for   Your the mate that fate had me created for   And every time your lips meet mine      Down and down I go   Round and round I go   In a spin, lovin' the spin I'm in   Under the old black magic called love   In a spin lovin' the spin I'm in   Under the old black magic called love   In a spin lovin' the spin I'm in   Under the old black magic called love   I should stay away but what can I do   I hear your name and I'm a flame      Flame, flame of desire   Only your kiss can put out the fire   Oh you are the lover I have waited for   Your the mate that fate had me created for   And every time your lips meet mine      Down and down I go   Round and round I go   In a spin, lovin' the spin I'm in   Under the old black magic called love.Don't leave me with these mixed emotions and dreaming of you   Are you out there somewhere?.(5) (6)      Afer Ventus."
"There are many ways that the setting affected the cyclist. One way is in the story when it says that it was very hot, he could become dehydrated and could possibly have a heat stroke, also the rodes were windy. This could be a problem because hes tired so he might not be able to go around the turns, he might just keep going straight and then get lost even more.

"The setting affects the cyclist in a large way. He has a hard time going on his journey. He began to lose hope, get tired, and began to think he was going to die. The settings played the biggest role. It was very hot with no people or buildings around him. He had very little water and no place to get anymore. He then encountered a large snake which made it worse because he was in fear with no one around to help him. If he would have followed his own directions instead of the old men he would not have had this problem. The setting around him really made his trip a hard one with no water, people, towns, or buildings around him..Feels so good, that I can't say goodbye..This nowhere train you're riding   Is going nowhere fast   You better watch your step   Or you're gonna burn in hell!.And why is it raining so?.I think of things that we do, all the way, ev'ry day..Dawn has come at last,   Twenty-five years, honey just in one night, oh yeah..Sheer heart attack   Sheer heart attack   Real cardiac      I feel so inar, inar, inar, inar, inar, inar, inar, inar - ticulate   Just how I feel   Do you know, do you know, do you know..There she goes my daytime girl."

"The settings of cyclist affects the way cyclist perform. If the weatheris too hot then the cyclist might slow down because of the sun beating down on them. If its too cold, the cyclist puts on more clothes which might weigh them down from achieving the speed they need to obtain. The bike has to be stable.

That why when you see cyclist you see them around, a road where theres cars around, just in case they get into trouble..My grandma was a wise old soul   Took me by the hand not long ago   Said, ""Son, what's your hurry, boy slow it down   Taste the wild honey, listen to the sound   Of the wind that's blowin' through the trees   Rivers flowin' to the sea   Yeah they're all headin' home just like you and me   Life's for livin' child, can't you see that?"".Everything's stuck together..Goes to show you don't ever know   Watch each card you play and play it slow,   Wait until that deal come round,   Don't you let that deal go down, no, no..O Sycamore, Sycamore!.(i can dig it!).Did you ever stop to listen   To what you're missin', in the things you say   If you open up your eyes   Than you'll realize, what I say      You can do what you want to   You can do if you try   You can do what you want to   You can do if you try      You take that golden rule   That you learned in school   And just throw it away   If you're well directed   Then you're protected, from the evil ways      You can do what you want to   You can do if you try   You can do what you want to   You can do if you try      You can do what you want to   You can do if you try.Body, body, bo-bo-bo-body, body   Body to body   Body to body   Body to body   Nobody does it like you do   Body to body   I love the way you make me feel   When you do what you're doing to me, oh   Touching me the way you do, you know, know you've got to feel it too   When you body's next to mine, you've got me hypnotized   Body to body   Body to body   You know I like the way you do what you do when you do it to me, oh   Body to body   Nobody does it like you do   Body to body   You know I like what you do when you do what you do to me, no   Oh, what you do   Flowing through this magic night   I love to feel you hold me tight   You are the one that's right for me   You got me feeling tingaly   Share the night with stars above   I think I've found this thing called love   Fever running through your eyes   You are my heavenly device   Body to body   Body to body   Body to body nobody does it like you do   Body to body   You know I like what you do when you do what you do to me, no   Oh, what you do   You opened up the world to me   You changed my life so tenderly   I know you are the only one   You're brighter than the burning sun   Don't know where you're going to   I don't care as long as I'm with you   That certain sparkle in your eyes   Has got me feeling oh so high   Body to body   Body to body   Body to body   Body to body   I like what you do when you do all those things to me   Body to body...."
"The setting is described by the author, were very challenging for three reasons, distance, water and the heat. All of these only occurred to multiply the effects of the others. As time had went on, the cyclist grew tired from the heat. In one sentence the effect of the heat were clearly described by the cyclist.Don't let your heart be filled with sorrow   For almost in tomorrow the dream you wish will come true..I pay my gardener to clean up my garden   I pay my doctor to check out da other ting   I pay my lawyer to fight for my rights   And I pay my bodyguard to guard my body   There's only one man I pay   But I don't know what I'm paying for   I'm talking about the taxman   I'm talking about the taxman   I'm talking about the taxman      What have you done for me lately   Mr Taxman   What have you done for me lately   Mr Taxman   What have you done for me lately   Mr Taxman   What have you done for me lately   Mr Taxman      You take from the rich, take from the poor   You even take from me, can't understand it now   I pay for the police to, err...I don't know why   'Cause if my dollar was good enough   There wouldn't be so much crime in the streets   They tell me you're a fat man   And you always take and never give      What have you done for me lately   Mr Taxman.Whoa, Take a look at the sky..It's been one week since we got to see   Cheatin' lovers and cousins that marry   Five days since they had the show   With the hermaphrodite, the slut and the crack ho   Three days since we heard the tale   About the guy who learned his woman was a she-male   Yesterday it occurred to me   That I've been watchin' a bit too much Jerry Springer      Holy cow, d'you see it last week?.Oh, I believe in yesterday..You..For all we know   We may never meet again   Before we go   Make this moment live again   We won't say goodbye   Until the last minute   I'll hold out my hand   And my heart will be in it      For all we know   This might only be a dream   We come and we go   Like the ripples, like the ripples in the stream   So baby, love me, love me tonight   Tomorrow was made for some   Oh, but tomorrow   But tomorrow may never, never come   For all we know   Yes, tomorrow may never, never come   For all we know"
"The features of the setting effect the cyclist in many ways. The scenery makes the cyclist turn worried, unconfident, and in the end an ironic hopeful. The cyclist came upon the first “town”, and described it as only having “one ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corrall” I believe this is when the cyclist realized the men were a little off, and began to worry: he also couldn’t refill water supply, so fear of dehydration also kicked in already tired, the cyclist became unconfident when he came upon the sign reading, “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit”. Knowing that this was going to be a long and slow journey, the cycles becomes unconfident that he can make it, finally, when passing the sign saying, ""Gary and Wilber's fish camp – If you want bait for the big ones, we’ve your best bet,"" the cyclist reached a hopeful stage, because he knew he had found civilization once again. I believe your atmosphere and surroundings can effect your general mood, and that stands true today with the cyclist..- Your love is judgment..[Chorus]      When we stand together, it's our finest hour   We can do anything, anything   We're believing in the power      [Chorus: x2].So this is permanent, love's shattered pride..'cause I love you for believing in me..I have a letter M'sieur   It's addressed to your daughter Cosette   It's from a boy at the barricade, Sir   In the Rue de Villette..There's got to be some way out of here   He says, ""Man, this life is cruel""   I knew this Puerto Rican girl who lied to change her life   She changed her name, her face   Because the grass looked greener on the other side   She turned her back, she ran away straight into the night   Her friends, her family feel the pain but she's the one who cries   Tell me what you want   Tell me what you need   I want everything   I've had enough of having nothing, I won't take just anything   I got my mind set on something, all I want is everything   It's my life Mr., I ain't running, I'm no puppet on a string   I want more than I see coming   All I want is everything, all I want is everything   My next door neighbor Donnie   Died in his room just the other day   His brother come home   Found him dead on the floor with a needle in his vein   Cops come down with a body bag   They said Donnie was a casualty   I said, all it's about is the boy checked out   He couldn't handle reality   Tell me what you want   Tell me what you need   I want everything   I've had enough of having nothing, I won't take just anything   I got my mind set on something, all I want is everything   It's my life Mr..'s   So hit the freeway, no lee-way 'cause this ain't your zip code   You keep your lip closed   Or you get those lips swole   We got your shit exposed, stay the fuck away from us   We'll light you up and disappear like we vaporous   My cavaliers, wearin' battle gear, run up in your fort   Put bullet holes in your shorts   Left you dead on your porch   Then we torched your spot, my cohorts got counts calculated   Shout out you hate it   That's what you get for doubtin' X-Raided   Deport your corpse in where the cops'll never bother to look   Rigormortis decompose you, served ya, bored, and now it's over   [Chorus] (2x)"
"The setting affects the cyclist becuse it is the passes is on a road much alot of hills it would affect him as being tired, or if the biter was in a place where the cold or hot it would affect him or his temp. and by his attiude..I didn't mean to ever be mean to you   If I didn't care, I wouldn't feel like I do      I was all wrong, but right or wrong I don't blame you   Why should I take somebody like you and shame you?.[Chorus]   If you see him in the street, walking by her side   Talking by her side, have pity   Look around, look around   They are going through the unimaginable.The note is eternal, I hear it, it sees me,   Forever we blend it, forever we die..I probably would have kept on guessing   But about that time we crashed into the truck   And as I'm laying bleeding there on the asphalt   Finally I recognize the face of my hibachi dealer   Who takes off his prosthetic lips and tells me   Everything you know is wrong   Black is white, up is down and short is long   And everything you thought was just so important doesn't matter   Everything you know is wrong   Just forget the words and sing along   All you need to understand is   Everything you know is wrong      I was walkin' to the kitchen for some Golden Grahams   When I accidentally stepped into a alternate dimension   And soon I was abducted by some aliens from space   Who kinda looked like Jamie Farr   They sucked out my internal organs   And they took some Polaroids and said I was a darn good sport   And as a way of saying thank you   They offered to transport me back to any point in history that I would care to go   And so I had them send me back to last Thursday night   So I could pay my phone bill on time   Just then the disembodied head of Colonel Sanders started yelling      Everything you know is wrong   Black is white, up is down and short is long   And everything you thought was just so important doesn't matter   Everything you know is wrong   Just forget the words and sing along   All you need to understand is   Everything you know is wrong      I was just about to mail a letter to my evil twin   When I got a nasty paper cut   And, well, to make a long story short   It got infected and I died   So now I'm up in heaven with St. Peter by the pearly gates   And it's obvious he doesn't like the Nehru jacket that I'm wearing   He tells me that they've got a dress code   Well, he lets me into heaven anyway   But I get the room next to the noisy ice machine for all eternity   And every day he runs by screaming      Everything you know is wrong   Black is white, up is down and short is long   And everything you thought was just so important doesn't matter   Everything you know is wrong   Just forget the words and sing along   All you need to understand is   Everything you know is wrong.yeah, yeah      Under the hill, with just a few notches on my belt   Take it away, don't want no more, no more   Even if you say just one more   I won't leave you alone      'Cause I'm goin' down the steps on a white line   Goin' down the steps on a white line   Goin' down the steps on a white line   Goin' down the steps on a white line   Straight to nowhere      Follow me down   Sexual chocolate baby.There you go, you did it again!.Bow in the presence of greatness   Cause right now thou hast forsaken us   You should be honored by my lateness   That I would even show up to this fake shit   So go ahead, go nuts, go apeshit   Specially on my Pastel, on my Bape shit   Act like you can't tell who made this   New Gospel homey - take 6."
" The setting of where cyclsit takes there journey effects the cyclist. The reason I say that is because in the story “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” the cyclsit came upon a conflict with the setting. The conflict waas it was very hot and he did not use little things to survive witch he did. These are the reason why I say the setting of where cyclsit takes their journey matters..The women in this town are being misused..The five years we have had have been such good times..Not gonna be your doormat, Not gonna linger,   It just ain't like that, So don't you click your fingers,      You said you didn't want me,   I'm not a pushover,   Now you're changing the story,   I'm afraid, man down, It's game over..Oh comet come down!.Should I apologize if what I say burns your ears and stains   Your eyes?!.Something I forgot that I used to know   Keeps on coming back around..I'm a director casting for a part   (turn on the light)   It's for a soap set here right in my heart."
" The cyclist was affected by long hours of riding the bike into the areas where he never been..Don't deny it, we can't defy it..I'm like yeah whatever, we're still living like that   When the sun's going down, we'll be raising our cups   Singing, here's to never growing up      Oh whoa, oh whoa, here's to never growing up   Oh whoa, oh whoa, here's to never growing up      We live like rock stars, dance on every bar   This is who we are, I don't think we'll ever change   They say just grow up, but they don't know us   We don't give a fuck, and we're never gonna change      Say, won't you say forever stay   If you stay forever hey   We can stay forever young      Singing Radiohead at the top of our lungs   With the boom box blaring as we're falling in love   I got a bottle of whatever, but it's getting us drunk   Singing, here's to never growing up      We'll be running down the street, yelling ""Kiss my ass!"".Whoa, let's have a party   Sending him to the store let's have some more   Let's have a party tonight..Any kind of fool with the will to live   Tries to get it right with the one they're with   But even though I give you special treatment   You keep getting high juvenile delinquent      And this is how it feels to be   On the payroll company   Your every scene is in the round   And all the men are falling down      Constantly harassed and misunderstood   I'm the 'lost and found' of the neighbourhood   And I am not a part of society   So don't get off the ground just be with me      And this is how it feels to be   On the payroll company   Your every scene is in the round   And all the men are falling down      I would brave the rainstorm in my car   Maybe you can leave but you won't get far   It wasn't just a dream it was much too good   Just another day in the brotherhood      And this is how it feels to be   On the payroll company   Your every scene is in the round   And all the men are falling down      And this is how it feels to be   On the payroll company   Your every scene is in the round   We don't need to hang around.Say goodbye, my baby..Nothing else matters   When youre in it for love   Together we can only go higher   You can reach any rainbow   Youre dreaming of   Nothing else matters at all   When youre in it for love baby..Now, in this ugly world   It is time to destroy all this evil."
" In the essay rough road ahead the setting does effect the cyclist because he has been pedaling for so long and he is becoming dehydrated “I had been hitting my watter bottles pretty regularly. I was in the @LOCATION1”. Another reason the setting effects him is because he is starting to see mirages “A sandblasted picture of a boy pouring a refreshing glass of grape juice into his mouth could still be seen..[Bridge: John Legend]   Oh, don't bring me down, I need a room in the clouds   I wanna get there babe, I wanna elevate   Oh my favorite mix, a little ignorance and bliss   In the penthouse babe, go to the penthouse      [Chorus: John Legend]   Go to the penthouse floor (let's go, let's go, let's go)   Go to the penthouse floor (let's go, let's go, let's go)   Let's ride the elevator, it's what we've been waiting for   We'll tear down those penthouse doors (let's go, let's go, let's go)   Those penthouse doors   We'll tear down the penthouse doors (let's go, let's go, let's go)   Baby, I'm in the penthouse floor   Baby, let's ride the elevator   Til we can rise some more   Go to the penthouse floor, penthouse floor (let's go, let's go, let's go).You gotta speak up, you gotta shout out,   And know that right here, right now,   You can be beautiful, wonderful,   Anything you wanna be, oh,   Little me      Little me      Tell you one thing I would say to her      I'd tell her to speak up, tell her to shout out,   Talk a bit louder, be a bit prouder,   Tell her she's beautiful, wonderful,   Everything she doesn't see..(Or are you waiting?).What's that playing on the radio, why do I start swaying to and fro   I have never heard that song before, but if I don't hear it anymore   It's still familiar to me, sends a thrill right through me   Cause those chords remind me of the night that I first fell in love to      Those magic changes my heart arranges   A melody that's never the same, a melody that's calling your name   It begs you please, come back to me   Please, return to me, don't go away again, oh make them play again   The music I wanna hear is once again, you whisper in my ear   Oh my darling, aha      I'll be waiting by the radio, you'll come back to me someday, I know   Been so long since our last goodbye, but I'm singin' as I cry   While the bass is sounding, while the drums are pounding   Beatings of my broken heart will rise the first place of the charts      Oh my heart arranges, oh those magic changes, oooh yeah.I once had a friend who I loved from my heart   But I went on and left her 'fore I'd made a start   Now I'm moaning the blues like the rest of the charts   Take me back      So I'll cry with a limp   Just get by on a limb   Till these blue eyes of mine they are closed   So here's to an old fashioned peck on the cheek   And farewell my sweet Northern Rose      Give me one last love song   To bring you back, bring you back   Give me one last video, just dressed in black, dressed in black   Give him a chorus and that bit at the end   Where he wails on and on 'bout the loss of a friend   Let him scream loudly 'well this love could mend'   Let it die, let it die      Those bloody great ballads we hated at first   Well I bought them all, now I'm writing worse   Save us from baldness and saving the earth   Take me back      And I'll smile with a limp   And I'll love with a limp   Till the clouds disappear from above   And as the storm moves away all I can say   Is there's a towel on the door for your love      Give me one last love song   To bring you back, bring you back   Give me one last video, just dressed in black, dressed in black   Give him a chorus and that bit at the end   Where he wails on and on 'bout the loss of a friend   Let him scream loudly 'well this love could mend'   Let it die, let it die, let it die.If you want the thrill of love I've been through the mid'l of love..Feel the cold wind blowing-winter's coming on   'Tis the season, so they say   If you need help believing 'cause your spirit ain't   Too strong   Hold my hand - we'll push that cloud away      Put a little holiday in your heart   It'll put a little shuffle in your step   Give you a song that you can sing   With a melody you can't forget   And if you wanna join in a little harmony   To keep the world from tearin' apart   Well you know where to look   Yeah - you gotta put a little holiday in your heart      There's a man on the corner who doesn't have a name   People pass and turn their heads away   But to share a simple kindness would set there heart aflame   And you'll get more than you'll ever give away."

Another problem was the dry air and snakes laying out everywhere in the desert. Also the hills were a big problem to because of the heat and know water. Finally the other problem was he knew he was going to die and the birds would eat at him and their would be nothing left of him. This is how the setting affected the cyclist..Only You!.Who could walk but live what they walkabout   A calm head in the middle of wartime   People go down just so they could get more shine   Girls wave your flag and surrender your faculty   Niggas got geez but its not really mack to me   Keep it soft like we killers and often gat   You walking on me guaranteed you be crawling back   Abstract see it like this is the king in you   Allies living one more if I'm fucking too   Dogs don't eat it up increase they feeding time   I'll be damned if a mutt starts eating mine   Let's stay clubbed out the moon makes it whistle   Pants gripped your ass now I hope they don't fall apart   Look around you tell me who else is shining girl   Fat rapping cats on my dick they just whining girl   That's just the magnetism that a Queens fella has   Range rover gism and he fronting with his Lexus ass   But watch I'ma drop to a bronco   See me in your Bentley nigga just honk yo!.And what do they do now?.Oh Monday morning,   Monday morning couldn't guarantee   That Monday evening   You would still be here with me..You irrelevent   We brought hands to the game, and we takin over   mind control em',like a hypnotic potion   puff of smoke em',nigga we don't bluff, we rolls em'   curve ya stomach, you vomit on tha rollercoaster   [Verse 2]   We been around the globe, done seen the world   Now we still make jingles fo tha boyz and girlz   and they like when a nigga say hahn (hahn!).?.The gypsy flies from coast to coast,   Knowing many, loving none,   Bearing sorrow, having fun."
"The settings effect the cyclist by the roughness of the ride. First, they go over a bunch of rocks, and the tire could poys. Next it could be smooth and easy. Also, it could be far away from towns and difficult to get back. There could be a lack of water making you dehydrate. That is how the setting around the cyclist could effect him..The curtains are drawn   Now the fire warms the room..Lord I gotta get on down..No matter how big we are   We dream of home   The place where we all belong   Therefore this sing      We are who we are   We'll never be a star   We are where we are   But we'll never be a star      No time to see all our friends   There where we are   Ten thousand miles are quite long   And much too far      We are who we are   We'll never be a star   We are where we are   But we'll never be a star.If they haven't earned it..Everyone says that I'm wild..I'm coming   I'm coming   I'm coming   I'm coming..Verse One: All things are possible for you all things are possible nothing's too difficult for you nothing's to difficult I'm ready for change ready for rain ready for favor I know you able to      Chorus: Turn it around open the windows of Heaven pour out a blessing overflow turn it around open the windows of Heaven pour out a blessing we cannot contain let it rain let it rain      Vamp: You have turned my mourning to dancing you've turned my sorrow to joy you have turned my whole life around thank you thank you Lord"
" The features of the setting of were the cyclist are affect them very drastically. They need a water supply and if they don’t have one they might dehydrate or even die. They need shade trees because it keeps the sun from beaming down on them so hard. They also need to cycle when its not as hot outside so that just incase there water gets low there is a better chance of survival. It would be great if there was someone with you to help if you get hurt. There should be buildings near by just incase of an emergency. It might even be good to carry a cell phone..I went up to Monto town   To see Uncle McArdle   But he wouldn't give me a half a crown   For to go to the Waxies dargle."".He's a very superficial man   He likes the girls that go there   He's a dude with a master plan   So young but why should he care?.Hello stranger, hello stranger..step up and play each machine seemed to say,as I walked round and round the penny arcade   Just ring the bell on the big bagatelle and you'll make all those colored lights cascade   And music played at the penny arcade, yes it played and it played, played all the time   Roll up and spend your last dime      Roll up and spend your last, roll up and spend your last, roll up and spend your last dime!.Did I do all that I could do?.so hard   Stayin up in the sky      Hey Mr..She's off in her own little world,   She's nobody's girl."

"The features of the setting affects the cyclist by not having good directions from old timers. In the text it says, ''Never accept travel advice, from a collection of old timers who haven’t left the confines of their porches since carter was in the office,” this means that the cyclist did not have good directions. Because the road might of changed and the old timers do not know because they been sitting on there porches all the time. The is why I think the salling affects the cyclist..Kill with power - die die   Kill with power - die die.Put your hand   Put your hand      True love never dies   I'm falling when time is passing   The world is pulling too fast   Love thing is made to last   Don't stop now and keep on trying   Live like nothing last too long   Don't give it up      Put your hands up   Dream until the morning   Put your hands up   Love is everything you've got      'Cause the sun will keep on rising   And every day the world will keep on shining   'Cause the sun will keep on rising   You get the way the world will keep on shining      'Cause the sun will keep on rising   And every day the world will keep on shining   'Cause the sun will keep on rising   You get the way the world will keep on shining      The love is better than yours, better than yours   Look in my eyes   Better than yours, better than yours   Look in my eyes      Lalalalalalala   Lalalalalalala      Put your hands up   Dream until the morning   Put your hands up   Love is everything you've got      'Cause the sun will keep on rising   And every day the world will keep on shining   'Cause the sun will keep on rising   You get the way the world will keep on shining      'Cause the sun will keep on rising   And every day the world will keep on shining   'Cause the sun will keep on rising   You get the way the world will keep on shining      Lalalalalalala   Lalalalalalala.Saugatuck River's flowin', Mother nature's colors were showin'   So cold, so rainy, we couldn't help feelin' blue   Not enough time, too many things to do..Nicodemus came at night so he wouldn't be seen by men   Saying, ""Master, tell me why a man must be born again."".Ah she danced like a floozie in a hot tub of guava   Achin' round the scene, you know she's hip to her mantra   He was a meditated fucker all strung-out on Sinatra   Hitting van Winkle like there ain't no tomorr-a      I saw van Winkle show up on the scene   I can't remember when I saw that's he's been doing all the   Sketches of Winkle crying to the heavens in a fit of rage   Sketches of Winkle keep little humans locked up in a cage   Sketches of Winkle I think I love her but she don't love me   Sketches of Winkle why don't you love me, girl?.Know where you're heading,   'Cause there'll be no regretting..[Fabolous]   If you ain't up on things   Fabolous is the name, street fam is the game   Screamin' 718 while them hammers bang   Like bludda ludda lacca bludda ludda lacca   Kick game like I know a little bit of socca   Spic, dames, ass and a little bit of knockas   Give them nick names and a little bit of vodka   Then I'm game change, (A very freaky girl)   You know who got the gold like the kid from ""The Last Dragon""   You know who got the low on the spokes and the ass saggin'   You know who got the gold that'll have your ass gaggin'   You know who got the boat that'll have the task naggin'   But I fuck bitches, and get money   My truck switches like,   You got to duck bitches when you get twenties   And plug switches that make you sit funny   I'm a rider..

"During the cyclist journey in “Rough Road Ahead” by joe Kurmaskie he expierences setting changes such as the road being flat then going to short rolling hills.

"The features of the setting affect the cyclist in a major way. For one, if the desert was not a deserted mountainous area, in California then the cyclist would not have the same problems. By changing anyone features of the setting you would change how the cyclist would behave in the setting. Thus changing the entire plot of the story. If the cyclist was say in the entry or a mere develop area then he would not face the same dangers as if he were in a mountainous region.

And he was cycling with very little water.  .Well, at least it wasn't fatal, oh, it was?.There is no greater feeling to unfold   Guided by the inspiration love is bold   It is the fire burning in your soul   It is the story waiting to be told   Wild and peaceful   Rare and free   Wild and peaceful   Rare and free      You came and took away my emptiness   Put in its place a gift of tenderness      Wherever your river will flow   You know my love will follow   Wherever your river will flow   You know my love will follow   Through the jungles of your mind      You are the treasure waiting to be found   You are the wings that take me heaven bound   Wild and peaceful   So rare and free.But it's not so bad,   You're only the best   I ever had..I just can't figure it out   What now?.It's a long time - goodbye..All your life you were only waiting for this moment to arise..Now you're gone the breezes blow so sadly   You never could understand the love I wanted so badly."

"The features of the setting had an affect on the cyclist.

"The features of the setting affect the cyclist in, “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” because it goes to many different terrains. The cyclist starts at a town and his working his way to Yosemite when he decides to listen to a group of old men. He started out strong until he got to the first town, which was totally abandoned. He kept going to another abandoned town. He decided to keep going until he saw a sign. The terrain was a lot diffrent with rolling hills and tumbleweed rolling by and a snake. Through listening to the old men the cyclist almost died from the threatening heat and lack of water.
