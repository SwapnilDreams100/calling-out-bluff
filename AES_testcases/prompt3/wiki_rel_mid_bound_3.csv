"The essay “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” describes a man’s bicycle ride through California. Now, California is very hot during the summer, which is when the cyclist is riding. This setting greatly affects the man’s journey. It made it very difficult for him to finish his ride.Until 2016 the initiative was known in English as the One Belt and One Road Initiative (OBOR) but the Chinese came to consider the emphasis on the word ""one"" as misleading..KATO (1230 AM) is a radio station broadcasting a News Talk Information format..The station broadcasts from an antenna 725 feet in height with an effective radiated power of 20,000 watts..The station's main frequency was on 101.2 FM, broadcast initially from Bolberry Down near Hope Cove, but later moving to a site near Soar in 2003.. He drank most of his water in the beginning of his ride so he gets very dehydrated. The text states, “The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips.” As you can see the setting makes this man’s bikeride very hard."
"Some features of the setting affect the cyclist. First the cyclist followed the old codgers advice of how to get to Yosemite National Park. Their advice was no use and didnt help her in the end. Next, “a tarlike substance oozed out” of what she thoot was going to be water.Broadleaf plantain is also a highly nutritious leaf vegetable that is high in calcium and vitamins A, C, and K.

Then the terrain changed to “short, rolling hills”, which wasnt helping, her bike better. Lastly, ""tumble weeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake”, slowed her down. All of these road blocks in the setting affected the cyclist."
"“Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” had a  rough setting between harzardous things and the death defying heat. The cyclist had to endure the pain of dehydration and determination.

He was travelling through a desert and claimed the temperature was @NUM1.WZDG (88.5 FM) is a radio station broadcasting a Christian talk and teaching format..Other railroad investors also received land for speculative purposes..Motive power for the railroad was provided by Shay-type locomotives, an Alco consolidation, a Heisler, and an Edwards Motorcar..WUSA's studios and transmitter are located at Broadcast House on Wisconsin Avenue in the Tenleytown neighborhood on the northwestern side of Washington..Also, the cyclist had to ration his water because it was ghost towns in which our character passed through. He used nature skills he’d once learned and began to suck on pebbles which take the mind off thirst and uses saliva to help refresh your throat. Throughout his adventure everything kept this young man from getting water and to whenever there was water any faster. He had survived and wouldn’t ever take shortcuts again"
"The features of this setting affect the cyclist in many ways. The setting is a dessert so by common knowledge you know that it is going to be hot and dry. Because it is hot the cyclist needs more water because he is getting dehydrated. And when he is on his low of water because it is dry into mouth gets drys.When Botany Industries became bankrupt in 1973, it closed the Broadstreet's and Weber & Heilbroner's locations it owned..It appeared to survive principally in the wording Surbiton Park Terrace on the 20th-century row of shops on the south-west side of Surbiton Road, just to the north of the original park..As less fortunate railroads began replacing their worn-out steam power with modern diesel locomotives, BAR initially purchased a number of used modern steam locomotives from railroads converting to diesel power..CBC TV channel offers its audience unbiased coverage of developments, diverse programs and, most importantly, CBC is the only broadcaster covering news in 4 languages - Azerbaijani, Russian, English and Armenian.. @CAPS2 because he is in the dessert he sees wild sometime dangerous animals, in the story he sees a ridiculously @CAPS1 diamondbrock snake, which I believe are venomous, @CAPS2 ‘because ‘ of the extreme heat of the dessert he realizes that he had ??? chance of dropping from heatstroke. @CAPS2 the writer said that the dessert had short rolling hills and rough road ahead ??? would leave worn the cyclist out. Because of this terrain the cyclist way affects."
"The narrator in this story goes through a tough journey insisting of hope, challenge physical pain, despair, and relief. All of these are further developed by the settings where they take place, For example after taking advice from old men at a campsite, he is on his way through the deserts of California. If he had been almost anywhere else, his journey could have been much better. He could have gotten more reliable advice, or had been in a place where the towns were not miles and miles apart. Also, at one point he reaches a snake on the road. This could symbolize a decision, which was to go and how it will affect the outcome of his trip, or perhaps the decisions he had already made.GTV broadcasts mainly local programming, with over 80% of the schedule consisting of original productions..Safe Driving Day, or S-D Day ""was inaugurated in 1954 to focus national attention on the traffic accident problem""..The Hotel Paramount in New York City is a hotel located at 235 West 46th Street, to the west of Broadway..As a law professor he helped prepare briefs for the U.S. Supreme Court to desegregate the railroads and the public schools, including the landmark case of Brown v. Board of Education.. To take advice from strangers and better yet he should use it. The irony continues as he becomes dehydrated and the flat land turns hilly. If that weren’t to happen he could have been more successful and healthy on his trip. The setting in this men’s story are necessary for if to have plot line and have the humour it possesses. If he were in the city, for example, he would not get lost and stranded, and therefore would have no story."

"In the story many different settings affected the author in many different ways. In the very beginning of his journey he came across a ghost town. He reacted to the features of this setting with humor and hope. “I chuckled, checked my water supply, and moved on."" He still has hope that he would end up safe and in the right place.

He grew worried when he saw that no near town was still in sight. “This sight was troubling” when the features of the next setting caught his eye he was desperate and devastated. “At some point, tumble weed crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake” He was on rough terrain in the middle of the desert with little water, when he reached the abandoned @CAPS1’s factory all his hope was lost and when he was planning his death. “I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean."" @CAPS2, when he reached the fish camp, he was relieved ""I had overwhelming urge to seek out Gary and Wilber, Kiss them and buy some bait.” He was overjoyed and overwhelmed because he had survived.    "
"Ghost towns are not exactly the most inviting place for a cyclis trunning low on water supply. In “Rough road ahead: do not exceed speed limit” the cyclist is affected in many ways by his surrounding settings. Starting off on a warm day with the sun bright start off as a good thing, while his mood is still fresh and happy expressions play on his face. But as he moves on he speaks of how “The sun was beginning to beat down” expressing his remorse of listening to the old men that led him on their “shortcut.” Along the road he comes to his first let-down, a ghost town with “one ramshackle shop, several rusty pumps and a corral that couldn’t hold the lamest male.KLJA (107.7 FM) is a radio station broadcasting a Spanish AC format..The Suttor River Causeway is a stone causeway built across the Suttor River on the Old Bowen Downs Road (today at St Anns Road, Mount Coolon)..The B9068 road runs from Scar to Kettletoft..Damal, formerly Petereke, is a town and district of Ardahan Province of Turkey, on the road from Kars to Posof..” @CAPS1 he tries to pump the water from the corral but gets a “battery-acid” flavor and is forced to continue onward with little left to drink. This affects his mood to pity for himself and anger at the men who put him into the predicament. By the end he is relieved though when he comes to GARY & @CAPS2 FISH CAMP, a place with a working sink full of cold water. He says he “had an overwhelming urge to seek out @ORGANIZATION1, kiss them and buy some bait.” His thankfulness is expressed to men he doesn’t even know but because they were the light at the end of his long, dark and very exhausting tunnel."
"The features of setting affect the cyclist. It was hard arrived at the first town for author. For example “Rough Road Ahead: Do not Exceed Posted Speed Limit.” The road that author was ridding, it was rough. @CAPS1 example is “Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.In the weeks prior to its broadcast on Monday evenings, brief clips of the program were shown to arouse viewer interest in which a character provided only the cryptic information that 'Frank Ross is OUT'..The containment requirement and testing requirement were imposed after review of the history of uncontained engine failures which caused serious damage to aircraft, consequent to the July 19, 1989 United Airlines Flight 232 accident..In broadcasting, digital subchannels are a method of transmitting more than one independent program stream simultaneously from the same digital radio or television station on the same radio frequency channel..The film was based on a 1911 Broadway musical play The Red Widow by Channing Pollock and Rennold Wolf and starring comedian Raymond Hitchcock..” All the road was hills and rough. Than “The water bottle contained only a few tontalizing sips.” @CAPS1 doesn’t have that much water. That was really hard."
"The setting puts a great deal of stress on the cyclist. The biggest issue he faces is the weather. He is a cyclist “traveling through the high deserts of @LOCATION1 in June.” He had been riding his bike all day and he was soon going to run out of water. Just when he thought he could drink more water, he drank “water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees.” The weather being so hot and humid, did not help the cyclist throughout his journey. Another factor of the setting that affected the cyclist was the terrain.KNPR broadcasts in HD.KNPR published the magazine Desert Companion..Great Grennell, the hill on which St Helier Hospital and Greenshaw High School is located, is up to 64m AOD at its highest point; Benhill to the south, approximately where Oakhill Road meets Thicket Road, is 60m; Angel Hill is 53m..The station broadcasts using a directional antenna at all times, with the signal extending to the east to avoid interfering with Class A stations in Canada and Mexico..The transmitter is off Clarkson Parma Townline Road in Brockport, New York.. “Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills,” is a main problem the cyclist faced. These changes in terrain played into the fact that the weather did not cooperate. The hills made the cyclist work harder therefore use more energy. Luckily the terrain had a positive affect on the cyclist as well. The stones he found on the ground, helped keep his mind off the thirst. There were many factors of the setting that negatively and positively affected the cyclist throughout his adventure."

It got so hot that he was becoming dehydrated.The book was written as an introductory textbook on the Protestant creed for those with some previous knowledge of theology and covered a broad range of theological topics from the doctrines of church and sacraments to justification by faith alone and Christian liberty..PSG Public Schools is a co-educational high school located on the Avanashi Road, Peelamedu, Coimbatore, India..He was the founder of Al Jeel Center for Youth and Social Studies: the house of a broad library on child labor and hosted a research with a sample of children between 1995-2000..However, what is left of the town does now sit along the paved road connecting U.S. Highway 95 to Beatty's airport.. He kept drinking his water, until he didnt have any left. Another reason is because the road turned into hills which made him use more energy. Finally, it didn't help that he hadnt seen any sign of living creatures except for a snake @CAPS1 how the setting affected the cyclist."

I was also very dry and and he started to get nervous about how thirsty he was. The flat ground models how there is nothing around that can help the cyclist, which made him scared. The story also metions that he is a ghost town"

Tanner Company for cash..The Wide Blue Road (Italian: La grande strada azzurra) is a 1957 Italian romance drama film directed by Gillo Pontecorvo and Maleno Malenotti.. He wasnt able to drink the water because the battery acid'' that was in it could have made him very sick. Also the unstable roads that he had to bike through made things hard. ''Rough roads ahead'' To ride on unstable ground can be very hard to do. So just these two examples, the water and Rough roads made the features of the setting deffinitly effect the cyclist."

"The features of the setting in Yosemite give the cyclist something in look forward to, but the feature of the sorting that he is in enduse in get there causes him despaire. As soon as the cyclist passes a ghost town and notices swettering hed of the sun during early endeavers of the trip he checks himself up as he says,""I brely noticed it [the sun], the cool pines and rushing hills of Yosemite had my name written all over them. Although the cyclist began to feel the toll that the trip and the sun was going to take on him, he erased the morning with the hope and bealy of arriving at Yosemite. The more the cyclist noticedthe sun the more he drank untill his water supply seemed low, striping as an old rusty water pump he had hope of being replenished but the taste of bitter battery acid caused the cyclist to stop drinking.Scuttled in 1945, the boat was raised in 1956 and commissioned into the newly-founded Bundesmarine as Hai, where she served until she sank by accident in 1966..Rodgers and Hammerstein originally wrote the songs for a 1957 television broadcast starring Julie Andrews, and it was remade twice for television and adapted for the stage in various versions prior to the Broadway production..Conventional hybrids will have a measure of off-road capability lacking in entirety from flat bar bikes..KJJM-LD is a low-power digital television station in the Dallas, Texas area of the United States, broadcasting locally on channel 34.. The rolling hills, Sun and tumbleweds did nothing to quech the cyclist thirst or at least divert his assertion. If the cyclists was to see a sign that said Yosemite @NUM1 miles away his spirits would have risen, instead he saw a sign that said, ”Rough Road Ahead” which did nothing to help him. If the terrain was more poporsed, easier to travel on and in plenty supply of water, the tune of this passive would be more hoped instead in such despair, the features of the setting caused the cyclist grief instead of hope."
"The setting and features affect the cyclist because with each building he hopes for water, but since he is traveling through a desert water is in limited supply and many empty buildings are left out in the wastland. These buildings create a feeling of releve in the cyclist anty to be followed by despair to find them abandoned.PCT takes part in elections through the Broad Front (Dominican Republic)..In 1956, the story was made into a Broadway play by Joseph Fields and Jerome Chodorov..Aconbury is a village on a road between Hereford and Ross-on-Wye..The broadcast tower used by the station is located in the Roxborough section of Philadelphia while studios are in Bala Cynwyd.. The land with no features also creates a feeling of lost hope in the rider making his entire ordeal that much harder. Over all it was an excureiatly experience physicly and mentaly for the cyclists."
"The cyclist was so set on seeing cool, piney trees and lakes, that when he saw dirt, snake, and no source of civilization worried him. More affectively, what he didn’t see scared him most. He did see windy rivers or trails hidden beneath all kinds of trees. He didn’t see any people or friendly little forest critters. Instead he just saw the same rusty color of dirt and the occasional snake. His mood was affected and he started to lose confidence and hope.Trimont was once two different towns, platted by competing railroads..The services include Radio direction finder and Radar Stations; stations broadcasting navigational warnings, time signals or medical advice; communication traffic for distress, emergency and safety including the Global Maritime Distress Safety System (GMDSS) and long range navigational aids..The phrase ""international communism"" made the doctrine much broader than simply responding to Soviet military action..An unlooper is a smart card repair device intended to break the card's microcontroller out of an infinite loop that has been either accidentally or intentionally programmed into the card's internal memory.. He wasn't used to the new surroundings and for a while doubted if he could even make it out alive. When he came across the run-down building of Welch’s factory, he was even more distraught. Fortunately, he did find civilization when he came to a fishing supply shop. This definetly boosted his spirits. Once he had saved his thirst problem and assured himself he has alive and would luckily stay that way, he sat down before wading out again in search of his destination."
"The settings affect the cyclists for many reasons. One, if the setting is nice, the rider can concentrate on the scenery not on only pain they are having. also, if the setting isn’t very nice, the rider would probably concentrate more on the pain than they would the scenery.WBRY (1540 AM) is a radio station broadcasting a country music format..Christ Episcopal Church is a historic Episcopal church located at 43 South Broadway (US 9) in Tarrytown, New York..Ganborough is a hamlet located along the A424 road, approximately 2 miles NNW of Stow on the Wold..He wrote and produced the low budget horror film Nailed (2006), and in 2008 he was the writer of a graphic novel, Back on the Road, drawn by Will Simpson and various local artists, published by the Ballynafeigh Community Development Association.. another thing is if the setting is very hilly & the rider has to drive over it, it @MONTH1 not feel the greatest. The cyclist would get even more pain than before plus the cyclist could could get dehydrated faster, the setting really does affect the cyclist."
"The features of the setting made the cyclist’s ride longer and harder than he expected. When the cyclist first headed out the road was flat and smooth. Halfway through his trip the “Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.” The cyclist continues to pedel even though he was slowed down to 12 mph.Dumbarton Common (Park) is situated in Townend, as is the BroadMeadow Industrial Estate and BroadMeadow Fitness Center..The Hanover Subdivision is a railroad line owned and operated by CSX Transportation in the U.S. states of Maryland and Pennsylvania..It provides more than 100 courses in a wide variety of study fields, such as finance, law, engineering, hospitality, business, IT, broadcasting and digital media..Rock Enon Springs is located 18 miles west of Winchester on Rock Enon Springs Road (VA 683) off Back Creek Road (VA 704) south of Gore.. The hills made the ride slower and harder because of the hills. Tuoards the end of the hills he had to make it “Over on long, crippling hill”. The word “crippling“ is used to show the phisical affect that the hill had on him. The hills were a feature of the setting which made the cyclist’s ride longer, harder, and more phisically demanding."
" There are numerous features in the setting that effect the cycleist. For example  the rough road.Fruit orchards and beautiful gardens thrive in the fertile soil and the road is lined with roadside stalls selling home-made produce, especially during summer..A half-hour special, Best of Fred, was broadcast on 18 September 1963 combining surviving sketches from A Show Called Fred and Son of Fred..The Arvon Township Hall is a public building located on Park Road in Skanee, Michigan..He graduated from Moscow State Institute of International Relations in 1980, and in the same year he became the editor, author and presenter of a weekly political program on State TV and Radio Broadcasting of the USSR.. A nother example is the tumble weed and the snake also affected the cyclist. In conclusion those are the reasons the setting affects the cyclist."
 The setting is like a desert with no water or people civilizations anywhere around him.. This make him more worried because if he dies know one will know for days or weeks probably.
"The features of the setting affect the cyclist because it is hard to go far on a bike when the place, you are ridding is dry, abandoned, a quiet, hot cold and straight forward.

So if something happen who would know. During his adventure he ran out of water making him dehydrated that didn’t help. The setting of the story seems tragic to the cyclist."
"There are many ways that the setting affected the cyclist. One way is in the story when it says that it was very hot, he could become dehydrated and could possibly have a heat stroke, also the rodes were windy.Railroad yards have many tracks in parallel for keeping rolling stock stored off the mainline, so that they do not obstruct the flow of traffic..She made her first screen appearance during the episode broadcast on 20 November 2002..The 2013 Tour of Flanders for Women was the tenth edition of the Tour of Flanders for Women single-day cycling race in Belgium and was the third race of the 2013 UCI Women's Road World Cup season..It is located on Royal York Road (formerly Church Street) at Stanley, in the Mimico neighborhood, part of Etobicoke.. This could be a problem because hes tired so he might not be able to go around the turns, he might just keep going straight and then get lost even more. That is all about how the features of the setting affect the cyclist in the story."
"The setting affects the cyclist in a large way. He has a hard time going on his journey. He began to lose hope, get tired, and began to think he was going to die. The settings played the biggest role. It was very hot with no people or buildings around him.Sally-Ann Wilson (born 16 June 1959) has been Secretary-General of the Commonwealth Broadcasting Association since 2010..Smith specializes in professional road and track cycling and has covered major international sports events including the Tour de France, Giro d'Italia, UCI Road World Championships as well as the UCI Track World Championships..In the year 2015, Alok Ojha ( Indian Postal Services) officer, took the Charge of Chief Postmaster Anna Road Head Post office..It is based in Namakkal in Mohanur Road.. He had very little water and no place to get anymore. He then encountered a large snake which made it worse because he was in fear with no one around to help him. If he would have followed his own directions instead of the old men he would not have had this problem. The setting around him really made his trip a hard one with no water, people, towns, or buildings around him."
"The setting of the essay didn’t really help the author at all on his journey. There were not many structures on the way. Either that, of the towns said to be, “a ghost town.” @CAPS1 this couldn’t have reassured the author that things were going his way. It also was very hot during his journey.He also competed in the men's road race at the 1992 Summer Olympics..The South Wales Trunk Road Agency was established on 1 April 2006, and by 1 April 2012 it was renamed the South Wales Trunk Road Agent..KPPT-FM (100.7 FM) is a radio station broadcasting a classic hits format..Their entrant was selected through the televised national selection ""Decata na Bulgaria sa super"", organized by the Bulgarian broadcaster Bulgarian National Television (BNT)..

So the setting definitely had to have affected his confidence and his energy levels."
"In the stories, don’t exceed posted speed limit, there are some very descriptive settings. In the stories these settings have a great effect on the cyclist. Through these our settings the effects change. Some good effects some harsh effects. The first setting that is described do you is, ""the cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite had my name written all over them."" This setting gives you a vivid picture of were the cyclist is heading. This setting also establishes a happy sort of mood. Let the pretty picture is about to change. Not so much further in to the cyclist ride he noticed a change of terrain,"" flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.The station commenced broadcasting on 1st April 2016 on 103.7 FM and online, playing urban dance music including house, garage, grime, dance, drum & bass..KKAY 1590 AM broadcasts a unique blend of Gospel and Christian music, current hits and the classic old time favorites..The show ran both Off-Broadway and on Broadway as well as in London..The station began broadcast operations in December 1968 as ""WRTM"" on 102.3 MHz under the ownership of the Maupin Broadcasting Company.."" @CAPS1 the cyclist is short on water, and is becoming very tyered. Seeing this just crushes his spirit. @CAPS1 riding hills hard, but ridding hills with our knowing of something good waiting for you on the other side of the hills. Both of these, very different settings gives off very different feeling. The first one makes you think he is going to have as easy enjoy able bike ride. But this all changes when he hit those horrible hills. Just the thought of having so ride over miles of hills, makes your legs hurt. Over all the features of the setting saposed an intense bike ride for the cyclist, followed by a reward by beautiful place.      "

The cyclist is trying to ride his bike to Yosemite national park.Jean Brankart (born 12 July 1930) is a retired Belgian professional road bicycle racer who was active from 1953 to 1960..When Rosal is accidentally killed by the bullfighter the hero goes to Morocco..CBRT's studios are located in the Cambrian Wellness Center, northwest of Downtown Calgary, and its transmitter is located near Old Banff Coach Road/Highway 563 and 85 Street on the southwest side of Calgary..Turner has been a technology innovator since late 1994 when he produced the first ever live video concert broadcast with a major label band on the Internet and organized the first video 'fan' conference with members of the classic rock band, The Doors.. He decides to follow the directions of coaple old men, which was a mistake.”…Simply because I listened to some gentlemen who hadn’t been off their porch in decades,”(Kurmaskie). The hot and dry conditions made the cyclists hardest obstacle to be staying hydrated."
"As if along bike ride through the city isn’t grueling enough, the author of this story had it much worse. First the climate was a recipe for a disaster. “High deserts of California in June.” @CAPS1 is clearly a debilitating factor as is direct sunlight and humidity. If the cyclist did not have the proper gean he could be hurt by all three of these factors. Secondly, “Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.The following is a list of non-numbered and numbered (Peel Regional Roads) in Mississauga, Ontario..She has also appeared in musical theater and off-Broadway plays..From 2002 it also took over investigating rail accidents, road accidents were included in 2005 and finally marine accidents from 2008..Cycle tracks may be one-way or two-way, and may be at road level, at sidewalk level, or at an intermediate level..” @CAPS2 his endurance is being tested because it is going for tolerance energy and will power to climb each individual hill. Most importantly, with his lack of water in his bottles, all of these characteristics were harmful. Within a desert, water is to be found nowhere. In hot weather, the water bottles will turn warm and in sunlight, water could even evaporate. To me, it seems like the setting and the weather were the perfect combination for doing much more harm than good."
"The features surrounding the cyclist effect him greatly. All he has around him are hills, rough terraine, sand + tumble weeds. These features leave him thinking he will die because there is no life around him.WIHM (1410 AM) is a radio station broadcasting a Catholic format..KJBX (106.3 FM) is a radio station broadcasting an adult contemporary format..Owned by DTV America Corporation, the station broadcasts a digital signal on UHF channel 21..David Law (born 7 September 1973) is a British sports broadcaster.. Everything is dry + vivid + thats how it makes him feel. The old, rusty water pump shows that it hasn’t been used in ages + the black tar pumped out is no help to his negative thought of life."
"The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. Ranging from temperature, surroundings, and the availability of water. First of all, the cyclist felt tired and exhausted because of the temperature and terrain, For example, “I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.” I can imagine the cruelty of the heat beating down on him while riding down the roads. It would make me tired and exhausted also. Second of all, the surroundings as he rode affected him and made him have less confidence as he rode further. For example, “This place might have been a thriving little spetatore time say, before the last world war-last on that morning it fit the traditional definition of a ghost town.It is triangular in shape; it is bounded on the west by St. Laurent Boulevard, on the northeast by Russell Road and on the south by Walkley Road..The name originates from the combination of Primer, meaning ""something that's unfinished,"" and 55, which refers to Interstate 55, ""the road that drugs run on to get to Chicago through Memphis""..The road is also a major point for street photography..It was introduced in the Broadway musical Billy Rose's Crazy Quilt, which opened in May, 1931, where it was sung by Fanny Brice..” It shows how the information he had been giving caused him to feel unsure of where he was going. I’d feel uncapable and would do the same in his situation. Lastly, the lack of water made him scared. For example, “conserve my water and go instead for an hour or so a lest of my inner spirit.” It made him think the situation wasn’t good. So as one can see, it affected the cyclist in many ways."
"In the essay “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” the author uses features of the setting to show the effects of the cyclist. In the essay the rider gets directions from two old men on a perch. In the essay it said, “Never accept braid advice from  a collection of old- timers who haven’t let be able centres of their porch since carter was in office. “This shows the old man could be wrong and places can change. Also, on this short cut he almost runs out of water. The essay ststed I would conserve my water and go inward for an hour or se – a test of my inner spirit. He is running out of water but has the determination to get to @CAPS1 last the terrain affects him.He set national cycling records and represented Pakistan in the individual and team road race events at the 1952 Summer Olympics where he was placed 1st among the Asian cyclists and 25th in the world in the 1000 m time trial..The company has been a sponsor in American motorsports for many years; for example, it is prominently displayed on Road America raceway..The case was largely viewed as a loss for network neutrality supporters and a victory for the cable broadband industry..It is on Narnaul (Haryana)- Behror(Rajasthan) road.. The Hills prove to be a challenge with a limited supply of water. The essay states. Flat roads were upleed by sheed, rolling hills. This shows he is extremely determined. Even though the hills added to the struggle he made it through. That is how the author used features of the setting to add to the struggle of the cyclist."

"After the cyclist spoke to the “old timers who hadn’t left the confines of their porches since Carter was in office,” his confidence in them began to ware. He entered the desert happy, hopeful and determined. As his water reservoir began to disappear, and he approached the sight of the old shed, canal and a couple water pump, he began to feel touched. He made an attempt to get the water from the pumps and it was hot and “tested like battery acid”.

He travelled through the desert and “ridiculously large snake” and was running low on water. Finally he saw a building in the distance, which ironically enlights was an abandoned juice factory a sign featuring a left sipping on some succulent icy liquid teased ruin, and he began to lose hope. He didn’t think he would make it to his destination or anywhere else for that matter. Although after approaching the old factory, he came across a bait shop where his hope and energy was founded."

"In the story, the cyclist starts out with a lot of confidence that he can complete the whole ride. But after he left first town he had been riding and needed water, so he stoped at a fork in the road he had just to;to get water from a pump which tastes like battery acid. Then as he progressed further in his trip he came to a sign that said “Rough Road Ahead: Do not exceed speed limit”(Joe Kurmaskie pg @NUM1) This part of his trip made it very challenging by making him face rough roads and mountains that he had to cross which sucked the water out of him.It was the third episode of series 4, and was first broadcast on 7 March 1985..The 2009 program involved the systematic collection of traffic data utilizing automatic traffic recorders located on various roadways throughout the state..The American Broadcasting Company (ABC) is an American broadcast television television network owned by the Disney Media Networks subsidiary of The Walt Disney Company, which originated in 1927 as the NBC Blue radio network, and five years after its 1942 divorce from NBC and purchase by Edward J.

So you can see that going over an the mountains, sucks all the water out of the cyclist, so he was so relieved when he got the water at the end."
"The features of the setting in which the cyclist is in change his outlook on the trip. When he first begins his trip, the road is fine, so he becomes confident.

The rider knows that his out look drastically changed depending on setting through his journey"
"The story Rough Road ahead: Do not exceed Posted Speed limit"" by Joe Kurmaskie was about a man traveling through some pretty difficult settings.

Without proper hydration, people often suffer heatstrokes or pass out, sometimes even perishing, it is entirely worse for this cyclist because of the effort he is exerting, pedaling over “short, rolling hills.” Even worse, the trail a few very old, eccentric men set run on doesn’t do much in the way of nuping with a depleted water supply.The Rennert railroad accident occurred in Rennert, North Carolina on 16 December 1943, 74 people were killed on the Atlantic Coast Line when the northbound Tamiami Champion struck the derailed rear three carriages of its southbound counterpart..The trolley extended from the western terminus on the east side of Herr Ridge at the Gettysburg Springs Hotel eastward to the Gettysburg borough after crossing Willoughby Run, McPherson Ridge, Pitzer Run, Seminary Ridge, Stevens Run (stone bridge), to the slopes of Baltimore Hill where it turned northward at the borough square to end at the Gettysburg Railroad Station..Much of the noteworthy architectural detail of this house can be viewed from the public road that fronts the grounds..The following is a list of county-maintained roads in Anoka County, Minnesota, United States..

As he is going down the road he sees a sign: Rough Road Ahead: Even though he is going 12 mph he could still hit a hole and go flying over his handle bars. If he does go over his handle bars he could run into the snake he saw then get eaten by the birds because he wouldn’t have any energic to get up. There’re some interesting sence in the story."

"The setting affected the cyclist, because he didn’t know if he was going to die or live.. He had used up all his water because it was so hot and his mouth was dry."
"The character in this short story has a most that changes with his surroundings.. Towards the beginning when he was enjoying his ride no said ‘’ The cool pines and rushing rivers of  Yosemite had my name all over them,’’ As time goes on and he begins to realize nobody inhabits the path he is on he becomes continues and the terrain become rougher."
"The features of the setting have a big impact on the cyclist. One feature is the hot weather and area he is in. He says he is in the “high desserts of California in June.” @CAPS1 being hot in @CAPS2, it has cyclist is around deserts, causing more heat. “I could drop from a heatstroke,” he says. Being hot from the sun beating down on him took away the cyclist’s energy he needs for riding his bike.

Being tired from no water, the cyclist had trouble going up hills on his bike. The last feature that affected the cyclist was all of the hills in his road. “Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.” These hills made it hard to go up on a bike, considering his lack of water, and the heat. All of these features affect the cyclist by making him lose energy and get tired and frustarated because of their negative impact."
"The features of the setting affected the cyclist in many was. First, the “town” The cyclist first comes upon is described as a ghost town. Although the cyclist chuckles about it, this setting sets up the long journey the cyclist has a head of him. There were other features that would negatively affect the cyclist. For example, “…I noticed the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.Bergen Arches is an abandoned railroad right of way through Bergen Hill (the lower New Jersey Palisades) in Jersey City, New Jersey..The legislation has earned broad support from entrepreneurs and the technology industry..NMTV broadcasts on Comcast cable stations 14 (Public-access television) and 15 (community news, sports, and more)..These broadcasts give the station more viewership than any other programming on WXSP..” (pg @NUM1). Flat land is much easier for a cyclist to pedal on. The change from flat land to hills affected his stamena and will to keep going. He really had to push himself to trudge up and down each hill. His determination finally led him to, “Gary and Wilber’s Fish camp…” (pg @NUM2). He finally found hope.   "
"The desert like land affected the cyclist by making him tired and loss of body water, then that therefor making him need water to go on.. I think the thought of being so thirsty made him become more weak. If he wasn’t thinking about it the ride wouldnt have bin so ruff"
"In the essay, “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” there are many features of the setting that greatly affect the cyclist. Many of these features affect him in a negative way. One such feature is the hills that are present in the essay. These probably exasperated the cyclist even more than he already was with the sun beating down on him. Another feature was the road sign that said “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” “The speed limit was @NUM1. I was doing a water-depleting @NUM2.It broadcasts a francophone hot adult contemporary format for the city's franco-ontarian community..The station commenced full-time broadcasting on 12 June 2009..Road building was central to planning policy for much of the 20th century in Bristol, England..She is also a four-time Tony Award nominee for her work on Broadway, receiving nominations for Plenty (1983), A Moon for the Misbegotten (1984), Serious Money (1988) and Spoils of War (1989).. Sometimes life can feel so cruel.” The author/cyclist probably felt like he would never make it. Also, the sign advertising grape juice probably made him feel life was even crueler with its sadistic irony. Finally, the bait shop offered much relief to the cyclist. “I had an overwhelming urge to seek out Gary and Wilber, kiss them, and buy some bait.” All in all, the setting affected the cyclist in some pretty bad ways until the end."
"The features of the setting in the story affect the cyclist by describing that he is in a desert-like area in Lodi, California. They say it is very hot and there is sand everywhere.

The cyclist was trying to get to Yosemite to get away from the heat and to have a cool, shady pine trees to sit under, and cool fresh water. This affects the cyclist because he gets dehydrated because of the horrid heat."
"The conditions for the cyclist in the story “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” are pretty dangerous. “a ridiculously large snake blocked the majority of the pavement balance my dehydrated state bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips” (kurmaskie, @NUM1).

"The setting of the short cut affected the cyclist in many ways.

Also in the story is says, ""flat roads were replaced by short rolling hills.KBBG is broadcasting using the HD Radio digital format as well as traditional analog audio..The buildings relate to the town's development as a harbor and railroad town in the late-19th and early-20th century..It is used for professional broadcasting, notably by Retevision, Bloomberg Television, Discovery Channel, AFRTS, ABS-CBN, GMA Network, and American Forces Network..The Connecticut Post Mall (previously named the Connecticut Post Shopping Center and Westfield Connecticut Post) is a three-story shopping mall, located on the Boston Post Road (Route 1) in Milford, Connecticut.."" This could of made the journey even harder for the cyclist because now he had a little more effort to get up the hills one more example is towards the end he says ""i began breaking my ride down into distances, i could see the horizon telling myself i could make it there."" By the cyclist saying this it seems like he has given up and he realizes that this journey is going to never end untill he dies. That is how the setting on the story affected the cyclist."
"Many of the features of the setting affect the cyclist. The cyclist is biking through deserts. “A rediculously large snake” this quote shows that only is weather and climate agasint him but also nature.” I could drop from heat stroke” another great quote showing how hot it really is where the cyclist is.” There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind.The Tottenham Mandem (also Tottenham Man Dem or TMD) are an organized street gang based in Tottenham, north London, that began on the Broadwater Farm estate prior to the Broadwater Farm riot in 1985..The following is a list of state roads in the U.S. state of Florida..This is a list of all freight railroad (not streetcar or rapid transit) lines that have been built in the Delmarva Peninsula south of the Philadelphia, Wilmington and Baltimore Railroad, and does not deal with ownership changes from one company to another..By then, the railroad bridge next to it was a steel truss structure built in 1906..” A great detailed desciption of where the cyclist is and how deserted the area is.” The bottle only contained a few  tantilising sips.” This cyclist is low on water in the desert and in the desert with no water that could be a very bad thing.

Also when the @CAPS1 describes the water pumps and what comes out o them, it can give the cyclist a feeling of disgust and remind them to always keep a good water supply."
"Many things in the setting of the essay ""Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” affected the cyclist throughout his journey.

" The features affects the setting of the cyclist because in some ways they through you off a little with others lines and then will get confused of what their acually talking about.

"The cyclist pedaled through all types of different terrain. Through   hills, high desert, flat roads and the woods. This cyclist took the advice of bunch old men who thought they knew a short cut to the Yosemite national park. This short cut turned out to be a nightmare. The cyclist had only brought so many water bottles and was quickly drinking them all.He attended Avigdor High School and Lauderdale Road Synagogue in West London..The R230 road is a regional road in Ireland, located in County Donegal..She is a main presenter of World News Today, along with Philippa Thomas and Kasia Madera, which is broadcast on BBC Four, the BBC News Channel and BBC World News..The area is encompassed between Outer and Inner Ring Roads, NH-1 and Rohtak Road..

The  terrain kept changing making it  hard for him not to be thirsty. Eventually he drank all of his water and knew he would die of dehydration or a heat stroke. As he came up over a long hill he saw a bait store and stopped inside to have a drink vowed not to listen to a bunch of old guys again."
"The features of the setting make him happy because he meets some people that tell him of a route that will take a lot of time off his trip.

He also talks about not talking directions from old timers. This is when the text says,”"
"The rider in the story “Rough Road Ahead” by Joe Kurmaskie has a very analyzing mind, which is affected by things around him. At first, the rider “rode into the morning...with a smile” because of the bright sun, and the “cool pines” and rushing rivers”...he is very confident with the old mens directions, this first sign of disapointment is when he comes to the “ramshackle shed...A musical version, A Bronx Tale directed by Robert DeNiro remained onstage into 2018, at the Longacre Theater on Broadway..WWPA (1340 AM) is a sports radio station broadcasting at 1340 AM and licensed to serve the community of Williamsport, Pennsylvania, United States..The station is owned by Sunbury Broadcasting Corporation and broadcasts a conservative talk radio format..WVPB is a Public Radio formatted broadcast radio station licensed to Charleston, West Virginia, serving West-Central West Virginia..” And the “...sight of this was troubling...” to him, but he rode on.

Finally he comes to a old bait shop, and the “modern bathroom” that he enters to drink from, gives him relief from the desert he had just been riding through."

Even though the pines gave shade it wasn’t enough to help the cyclist. Eventually he reached some what civilization after enduring a grueling climb and by cycle trip through the woods."
"The essay on ""Rough Road Ahead"" is about the dangers of speed and assault. It’s just letting you know to follow instructions and read signs.They use normal roads and motorways for most of the route between Schiphol Airport and Amsterdam-Zuidoost..The main road entering Jarbidge from the south, Charleston-Jarbidge Road (National Forest Road 062 and Elko County Route 748), runs along the western slopes of the mountain as it travels between Coon Creek Summit and Bear Creek Summit, providing close vehicular access to the summit of Coon Creek Peak..She had previously suffered another accident when heavy seas had damaged one of the funnels and water had nearly flooded her engine room..They coordinate and sometimes serve as an anchor on news broadcast programs.. You should always keep close @NUM1/= out for signs and things.  "
"The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways.For example, ""I noticed the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills."" This quote shows that his surroundings were giving him diffuculty and a challenge for his travel. By describing the hills as ""rolling"" it helps the reader imagine the obstacles he was going through. Also, the sign that read, ""Rough Road Ahead; Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit.Originally, Five Forks was a small town located at the ""forks"" of Old Keene Mill Road and Lee Chapel Road..WHUS broadcasts a diverse mix of music, from polka to hip-hop, with several public affairs shows as well..Lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) rights in Queensland have advanced significantly from the late 20th century onwards, as have LGBT rights in Australia more broadly..Rai 2 is one of the three main television channels broadcast by Italian public television company RAI alongside Rai 1 and Rai 3.."" gives the reader a feeling that the character is in danger. Lastly an example of the setting that helps shows the charcters hardships is, ""no one in sight, not a building, car or structure of any hand."" If anything were to the happen to the character, as the author was foreshadowing, he'd be stranded and all alone to die. He'd be in trouble and there would be no one to help him. If the author did not use these examples, the reader would not easily get a picture of the troubles he had to overcome. In conclusion these examples added emphasise and meaning to the text.   "
" At first he was mad because he took advise from old men who never left their porch. He got scared he was going to die because had he drunk all his water and he didn’t know how long it would be till he got some more.

"The features of the setting affect the cyclist, in the story Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit, in many ways. The cyclist is affected because the setting is depressing and frightening. When the cyclist first sees the speed limit sign of 55 mph, he says, “Sometimes life can be so cruel”. Because he can only go 12 mph considering he's on a bike.Connector Motorways was supposed to operate the tunnel concession until 2037.International toll road operator Transurban bought the tunnel in May 2010 for $630 million and became the new operator..BMW developed the 503 alongside their 507 roadster in an attempt to sell a significant number of luxury cars in the United States..In September 2005, episodes resurfaced on Boomerang and were rebroadcast as part of Captain Caveman and the Teen Angels..Caravatta's broadcasting career began in 1999 as an analyst on the Lions' pre- and postgame shows.. After seeing the sign, a snake crosses his path. He’s frightened by it because it looked like a diamond back and he was trying to keep his balance and ease past it. Since the main problem the cyclist is faced with is the lack of water, the dry, long hills seem to make him more weak and tired. Tumble weeds crossed past him and there was no water in sight That is how the features of the setting affect the cyclist."
"The features of the setting affected the cyclist greatly. It made him become dehydrated. For example, in paragraph @NUM1 sentence @NUM2 he stated “I eased past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state.It is an amateur event where competitors in specially built four-wheel drives compete in a number of trials which address all aspects of off-roading, including navigation, vehicular recovery, vehicle maintenance and bush survival as well as off-road driving skills..The film was released by Open Road Films (the company's final film) in around 250 theaters in the United States on October 27, 2017..It was devised by Frank Harary in March 1977, and is a broader definition than that of an m,n,k-game..No Hiding Place"".In 2013, Hicks appeared on the Yeah Yeah Yeahs' album Mosquito performing as part of Broadway Inspirational Voices on the first single ""Sacrilege""..” This shows how the heat and climate of the setting affected him by how he was getting thrown off balance and wears     to him getting dehydrated. The setting of the story “Do not exceed posted speed limit,” by Joe Kurmaskie, effects the cyclist in the story."
"“@CAPS1 directions, June, lack of water” all are elements that effect the rider on his ride. He took directions from older people who promised the rider a short cut. I turned out that their short cut was wrong. When the rider went on this trip, it was June in California.The channel broadcasts a mixture of movies, entertainment and sport for 12 hours a day from 01:00 pm to 01:00 am GMT..Telephone Road was and is a dynamic thoroughfare meandering from the east side of Houston through working-class developments and suburbs, out to the area that was the countryside (until broad development of Pearland and north Brazoria County)..NTrak is one of several model railroad module standards..The group was merged into MI16 (scientific and technical intelligence) when the latter was created near the end of the war, and MI10 became the section responsible for road intelligence..

These were some elements that effected the rider on his trip."
"The feature of the setting greatly affect the cyclist in “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit.” The features in the story changed the speaker’s mood throughout his journey.

Then he passed a snake and had the obstacles of the hills which made him become determined. Finally, his determination changed to relief where he reached Gary and Wilber’s fish camp. In conclusion, the setting in the story greatly affects the cyclist by changing his moods and attitude towards his journey."
"The features of the setting affects the cyclist in many ways. First of all, if the cyclist didn’t listen to the old man, he would have never gone through this trouble. Also being that he didn’t have enough water when he went on riding, caused him to be real dehydrated.From 1988 to 2000 she was news anchor of the main Dutch public news broadcaster NOS Journaal..Including its broadcast translator at 94.1 FM (W231CW), the station broadcasts into 7 counties to include; St. Clair, Jefferson, Shelby, Talladega, Calhoun, Etowah, and Blount..It is an adaptation of D.

He should of turned back as soon as he ran out of water. Plus the heat made him real hot and thirsty. He should know how to never trust any strangers and try things on his own."
"The features of the setting affect the cyclist for many reasons. If the setting is dark trainy, there aren’t going to be ??? running outside.He acceded to the position of Rebbe following the sudden death of his father, Rabbi Menachem Shlomo Bornsztain, the fifth Rebbe of Sochatchov, in a traffic accident in Jerusalem..It is on the south bank of the River Thames between Runnymede and Thorpe and has a road to junction 13 of the M25, the Causeway, hosting major businesses..The film was first broadcast on 30 May 2016 on BBC One..It was first broadcast in 1989 in Europe, and then in the United States in 1990 as part of the weekend/weekday morning programming block, The Funtastic World of Hanna-Barbera.. If it is snowing, the ??? are not going to be swimming in the water."
"The cyclist is beginning at what seems a fine idea and place. Then the conditions become hot, dreadful, and maybe sticky. The constant heat without any breeze was getting to the character. Mirages appeared, or so he thought.TNT Film is a German television channel owned by Turner Broadcasting System Europe..I Luv NY (International title: I Love New York) is a 2006 Philippine television drama comedy romance series broadcast by GMA Network..The village of Nebo, Illinois is on the west side of the township, at the intersection of County Highway 7 and County Highway 10, also called Vin Fiz Road..Bing Crosby sang the song in The Big Broadcast of 1936.Crosby recorded the song on August 14, 1935 with The Dorsey Brothers Orchestra and it reached the charts of the day peaking at No. 2 during a 7-week stay.. He actually thought he might die. Not quite an optimistic one is he? “ It didn’t really matter. I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean…” The heat must have been bad, he wasn’t thinking straight and was slowly checking himself into a mental center! Although painful heat was a brilliant way to learn a lesson in cycling, and the old men “helping” with directions."
"The features of the setting in the story “DO Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit”, affect the cyclist in the story, in many ways. The first of which would definetly be the lack of water the cyclist had, and the fact that there wasn’t anywhere around for miles. From the text it read “There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind.” This evidence from the text proves to the reader that the cyclist was getting worried. Another part of the setting would be the obvious element of temperature. The cyclist is our in the hot, relentless desert.She lost her right arm in a car accident at the age of 10..It is mainly situated between the A5009 and A53 roads..It was the name of a bridge over the Jordan River on the Nablus - Es Salt - Amman Road..The concert was broadcast on NBC from American Airlines Arena, in Miami during Thanksgiving weekend.. “Wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June.” The author here, by using the elements of nature, is trying to make the reader concerned/scared for the main character. The final key had to travel and the road conditions. Although the desert is flat, he began to notice some hills in the road, and such a long distance, including the heat, could be deadly. The setting’s elements, greatly effect the cyclist in this story."
"The cyclit of “Do not exceed posted speed limit”, was greatly affected by the setting of his bike ride, which caused him pain and displeasure. He travels in the high deserts of California in June, which he exaggerates that water there was “@NUM1 degers”. The great heat caused him to drink lots of water, depleting it much quicker than he would’ve wished. It also sopped the energy out of him, further complicating his ride.Christianization is the broader cultural term, and typically has involved efforts to systematically convert an entire continent or culture from existing beliefs to Christianity..The Yezdi Roadking 250 was another competitor..However, the southern road appears to have drifted..It is bounded by East Capitol Street to the south, Minnesota Avenue to the west, and Benning Road (for which the neighborhood is named) on the north and east.. Along the way there is literally nothing there and he has nowhea  to replenish his water supply. The hilly, rough terrain also calls for hard, tough peddling, sopping even more energy. The heat, terrain, and lack of places to stop combined for an awful ride for the cyclist of this story."
"The lone biker in “Rough Road Ahead: Do not exceed posted speed limit” by @PERSON1 is strongly affected by the features of the landscape. The sun is the most important factor; it drives him to first consume his water quickly, and then drives him search for a water source.”The sun was beginning to beat down, but I barely noticed it...I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly,” in this quote, it reveals that even though the biker had not acknowledged the sun, his body had required water, depleting his supply in his water bottles. A lack of water feeling two hundred degrees.Though her death was ruled accidental, some think the driver was paid off by a foreign figure..The American Railway Association (ARA) was an industry trade group representing railroads in the United States..The show is a production of ""The Tapes Team"" at SIRIUS, along with Master Tape Theater, Stern Spotlight, The History of Howard Stern and Road Trip..She won the Norwegian National Road Race Championship six times....it had the flavor of battery acid."" The only water that the bike is able to find is not consumable. The most important of the factors, in the matter of survival, is the fish camp that the biker finally reaches. ”I stumbled into a rather modern bathroom and drank deeply from the sink.” The biker had been on the brink of dehydration and the fish camp is where he finally reganed the strength to continue on his journey."
From the setting that affected the cyclist are possible conditions such as the weather and surrounding enviorment like hills and streams or even tyes of animals and if they are poisenous or not.. The setting has and can change the desision a cyclist makes.
"The features of the setting in “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” affects the cyclist in many ways. First the setting does not look like what the cyclist has been told it lacks like. The cyclist had stopped to get directions from a group of older men who’s directions were out of date. Second the conditions of the road affects the cyclist.It can also be reached by a number of residential roads in the Nixon Tracts development on Magnolia Ridge from Magnolia to the south..It is located several kilometers to the northeast by road of Beni..Initially shown in prime time, the program drew only a minimal, public-affairs oriented audience running against two high-profile Sunday night variety series, The Ed Sullivan Show on CBS and The Steve Allen Show on NBC; however, its appearance helped ABC to meet the public-interest requirements imposed on United States broadcasters by the Federal Communications Commission..This article lists and details episodes from the second series of the show, which was first broadcast in 1986.. In the essay the cyclist explains that, ”Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.” A final feature of the setting that affected the cyclist was the temperature. The hot sun beamed down on the cyclist. As you can see, the features of the setting in ""Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit"" affects the cyclist in many ways. "
" Setting plays a big role in this story. Without being in the desert in the hot @DATE1 there would not be a confict.This Time Tomorrow was a BBC National Lottery game show broadcast on BBC One from 5 July to 23 August 2008..The 2014 women's road cycling season was the third for the Astana BePink Women's Team cycling team, which began as Be Pink in 2012..KJSM-LP (97.1 FM) was a radio station broadcasting a religious format, that was licensed to Yucca Valley, California, United States..Frederick J. Segura Chirinos (born January 16, 1979) is a male professional track and road cyclist from Venezuela.. There would be no importance in saving the water so he would not dehiderate. And the long flat roads are a symbol that the journey has still got a far way to go but as straight roads turn into hills it shows that there is a change in the journey and something better is about to happen."
"The features in the setting of the essay affect the author in one major way, dehydration. There are several features that causes the author to dehydrate. First off, he is riding throught a desert located in california. This means that there is bent from the sun constintly beating down on him.Its boundaries are Wellington Way to the north and east, Keithshire Way to the south, and Clays Mill Road to the west..The band, Kisses, a trio consisting of three girls: Kymora, Stefania and Sterre, were chosen internally by the Dutch broadcaster on 27 May 2016..Tayside Sound Limited was incorporated on 27 April 1979 to set up a radio station in accordance with the then regulatory body, the Independent Broadcasting Authority..Epicaerus texanus is a species of broad-nosed weevil in the family Curculionidae.. Also the change from “Flat read”, (Kurmaskie) to “short, rolling hills” (@CAPS1) also affected him, getting dehydrated. This change cased him to use more energy to climb up the hills which means he used more water because he got thrister faster. This is how the features in the setting affected the author of the essay “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit.”"
"In the story the author says, “The sun was beginning to beat down trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state,” This gives you the idea that the heat is getting to him and is steadily depleting his water supply. At ore point he almost gives him self up to despair and dies of dehydration. It seems that he will never reach his good and he will continue to suffer in the grueling heat. I could almost feel the sweat and heat that the cyclist was feeling.In the United Kingdom, the series was originally shown on Channel 4, but later series were broadcast on Discovery Channel UK..KBZI (100.7 FM) was a radio station broadcasting a hot adult contemporary format..Bob Donaldson is an American television news anchor employed at Tribune Broadcasting-owned CBS affiliate WTTV and Fox affiliate WXIN in Indianapolis, Indiana..The new company has a broader remit, and releases a much wider range of music.. Also, I could almost feel the lump in my throat when he says, “with any luck I’d hit a bump and lodge a pebble in my throat.” The heat definitely effects this mans cycling in a bad way. He was exhausted and could not go on without water."
 The cyclist thought it was hard.. Also he was upset that the old timers gave bad directions.
"The setting in the story ""Rough road ahead” plays a great role on the characters journey. Some features that are mentioned in the story are heat, rough road, long crippling hills and a abandoned Grape Juice Factory. The heat in the story drives the cyclist into a dying thirst. @CAPS1 does her best to conserve her water through out the trip but the dry dessert heat doesn’t allow it. Then comes the rough road ahead. The cyclist trys to keep a steady and secure pass as @CAPS1 peddels along the bumps and breaks in the road.The sloop was accidentally burned and sunk in 1783, giving an earlier date for this technique provided the sherds are from that wreck..The station broadcasts a Oldies format and is owned by Monte Spearman and Gentry Todd Spearman, through licensee High Plains Radio Network, LLC..WSNT-FM (99.9 FM) is a radio station broadcasting a country music format, licensed to Sandersville, Georgia, United States..Nazko River is a tributary of the West Road River, one of the main tributaries of the Fraser River, in the Canadian province of British Columbia.. The long crippling hills are next in line the cyclist has to use all her energy to work up the hill. @CAPS1 wipes the sweat from her eyes to make sure its not a mirage and then @CAPS1 see’s it the abandoned factory. This is where the cyclist loses all hope for if @CAPS1 doesn’t receive water soon @CAPS1 is sure to be eaten by the birds. “Then, and easily as rounding a band, my troubles, thirst, and fear were all behind me. Gary and Wilber Fish Camp.” @CAPS1 rushed to the bathroom to drink the refreshing water to the sink pride and accomplishment overwhelm her."
"The features of the setting affect him because it is hot and their is no where to go. An example from the test is when they said ""There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind."" There was also a part where he got to a sign that said ROUGH ROAD AHEAD: DO NOT EXCEED POSTED SPEED LIMIT.The speed limit was 55 mph.There is access from Groby Road..The station is no longer in use, though the track behind it is still used by a Delmarva Central Railroad freight line..Stearns County, Minnesota has many county roads, some of which are county state aid-highways..Although the Ethiopian government has not officially confirmed the perpetrators, a Mogadishu-based Somali radio station, Radio Shebelle, broadcast a statement by the leader of a Somali militant group, which said the explosions were aimed at ""the Ethiopians, the enemy of Islam"".. He was doing a water a water - depleting 12 mph. Sometimes life can feel so cruel. Thats what affected the cyclist the heart the hilly roads, no water, snakes, rough roads, and most all no directions."
"When the cyclist is in the “serenity of an early sunset evening”, the man enjoyed his cycling just hoping he could cut his time in half. Then, once he got the advice and headed down the road he saw a ghost town which is never good. Next he came to the fork and the town he came to had no water.It was broadcast on NBC from December 29, 1940, to July 20, 1941, and on the Blue Network from December 26, 1943, to September 24, 1944..This was applied to the road carriage above mentioned and the first trips were made in September 1833, with a drag and omnibus attached, a speed of sixteen miles an hour being attained..The Engineer Battalion plays a supportive role on the battlefield performing such tasks as fortification, bridge and road construction or destruction, laying or clearing landmines, neutralization of improvised explosive devices (IEDs) and general engineering tasks under fire..KIYS (101.7 FM) is a radio station broadcasting a Top 40 (CHR) format serving the Jonesboro, Arkansas, area.. On the way to the new town he came to the bumpy road and going @NUM1 he was out of water but finally after his determination he made it to a place that was very nice. So as you can tell the features of the scenery road affected him greatly."
" Two of the biggest setting in this story is the desert and rolling hills. This would effect the rider becaus of the dehydration that he would experience.The E. W. Scripps Company is an American broadcasting company founded in 1878 as a chain of daily newspapers by Edward Willis ""E. W."" Scripps..There are also many trails from the road to the water's edge, all in close proximity to Leith..The town also host the Building and Road Research Institute of Ghana..Field is a graduate of Broad Run High School in Ashburn, Virginia.. Being in the desert would make it obviously hot so you sweat alot and the hills would make it tough on your body because you put extrat strain to get up them. So all together this would be a hard bike ride."
"The feature of the setting is making the cyclist frustrated, thirsty, and confused.. The features are making him frustrated by he thought he was going the right way where he really was going out."
"Certin features of the setting affected the cyclist. In the essay by Joe Kurmaskie, he desribes he’s experiences when he cycled through the desert. ''...arrived at the first town''...A driver's license is an official document permitting a specific individual to operate one or more types of motorized vehicles, such as a motorcycle, car, truck, or bus on a public road..It was first broadcast on ITV on 1 May 2011, and to date, eight series have aired..The channel broadcasts programs related to motorsports and other automotive shows..The station is currently owned by Iola Broadcasting, Inc...it fit the traditional difinition of a ghost town. ''at first the cyclist was amused at this town and maybe a little scketle at it because the old “codgers”  told it to be thriving. Halfway through his journey the stated ''sometimes life can be so cruel.” Water was running low and he still had a ways to go untill he made it to the park and he felt as If it would never end. All that he sees aroun him as hills of nothingness under the sorching son with his limited amount of water. No buildings are around the cyclist. The ghost town and the lack of shade or soluation are very features of the setting that make that cyclist feel like a fool for taking advice from older men.        "
"The conditions that the bicyclist faced that affected his trip were various amount of things that could really screw your ride up. Some of the conditions were hot It was very hot and that makes it hard to think fast, move fast and make good decisions another would be there was lose gravel and that makes it tough to maneuver and you have to watch your speed. So he’s not going anywhere in a hurry. also there were lets of hills and that makes for an uncomfortable ride and a tiring one atthat.In 1890 the East Shore Terminal Company was formed by a syndicate of outside railroad investors..The road is a section of the A1202 London Inner Ring Road and as such forms part of the boundary of the London congestion charge zone..The only road other than the state highway is named after one of the gold mining towns first resident's Micheal Prendergast hence Prendergast Road..The CN line was formerly the main line of the Gulf Mobile & Ohio and its predecessor Alton Railroad and currently carries Metra Heritage Corridor commuter trains and Amtrak passenger trains to St. Louis.. Adding to that he was fresh out of water and that can mean dehydration again bud judjment and even heat stroke or exoustion another bad thing is he was in the middle of nowhere so its not like he could stop. Some where we asks for a drink to, there was nothing around for miles. These things show how rough the rode was made because these conditions exsisted."
"The setting affected the cyclist because they were in California in June traveling back rodes, with no place to stop for water, if the cyclist would have followed the path they intended on following the ride probably have been more enjoyable and he/she wouldn’t of had to worry about a heatstroke or running out of water, they would have been fine.."
"The features of the setting had an affect on the cyclist.. I know this because in the story the cyclist said that he was “going to drop from heat exsostion”, he is riding through the desert in @DATE1, and he took directions from three old “gentlemen” sitting on a porch."

"The features of the setting affected the cyclist, by putting him in unwanted places starting off with this man took advice from many older men, which don’t even know the area anymore. So riding through this man seems lost, he is trying to follow their advice, but comes across many unknown, unwanted areas.

"The conditions and features of the setting caused the cyclist to be tired and dehydrated and think that he was going to die from it.

"“Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” is an inspiring and almost humorous essay it take the reader inside a journey in a cyxlist daily routine. In this story the author fights dehydration as he tries to make to a national park with shortcut directions from “old timers” the setting of this storygreatly affects the cyclist and the pitty the reader feels for him. Half way through the essay, the biker had already traveled roughly @NUM1 miles; that’s extremely crazy. The fact that he is travelling through California deserts in June is even harder to believe. The first time he mentions the setting, he states he is in a ghost town, two sentences after he states that the sun was beating down. At that point he wasn’t really bothered.It is one of the four songs featured in the film that are not present in the original Broadway play..The Old Union Meetinghouse, now the Union Baptist Church, is a historic church at 107 Mason Road in the Farmington Falls area of Farmington, Maine..The series was first broadcast only on North Carolina's PBS channel..Located at 636 S.

Another description of his setting that probably affected his ability to peddle was when he states “flat road was replaced by short rolling hills.” He was already dehydrated and had already traveled so far, the rocky roads probably didn’t help his journey much. The setting basically made the story. If he wouldn’t have been peddling in the desert, it would have just been another trip in his life. The setting makes the reader see what cyclist really go through. "
"Due to the features in the setting, including the hot summer weather, the cyclist not knowing the area, and the California desert the cyclist is affected. In the short story “Do not exceed posted speed limit” by Joe Kurmaskie the cyclist is travelling through the hot desert in June when he realizes hes running out of water, “I had been hitting my water bottles pretty reguarly and I was travelling through the high deserts of California in June”(Kurmaskie).

Also the cyclist realizes he should have never taken the direction from the old men and thinks to himself, “…The growing realization that I could drop from heat stroke on a gorgeous day in June”(Kurmaskie). This quote proves that the heat of the desert is taking a toll on him."
"In the essay, “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” by Joe Kurmaskie, the setting affects him negatively because he was on his bicycle and he was in a hot area and no water whatsoever, like  in this quote, “I  got down on my hands and knees, working the handle of the rusted water pump with all my strength.

Also, another negative thing is that he thought he was never going  to get to where he was going, but in the end , he got there and he got some water."
"The features of the setting affect the cyclist in a major way. For one, if the desert was not a deserted mountainous area, in California then the cyclist would not have the same problems.

Thus changing the entire plot of the story. If the cyclist was say in the entry or a mere develop area then he would not face the same dangers as if he were in a mountainous region. The settings features have a huge affect on the cyclist."

"The features of the setting affected the cyclist in several ways. The first was the terrain, which started out flat, then turned to hills. The cyclist was growing tired from all the pedaling. “Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.” This tired him out faster, since going uphill is harder than riding flat terrain.Another distinction of the night was that Mary Kay Place won a Major Acting award for a TV show (Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman) that had no major network, only broadcast in Syndication - the first time this rare feat has occurred..She made her Broadway debut at the age of six in The Wisteria Trees, Joshua Logan's Americanized adaptation of The Cherry Orchard starring Helen Hayes..The Cloyne Round Tower is across the road from the cathedral and has been used as the tower for the cathedral bell..Reborn in the USA was a British reality television show broadcast on ITV, in which ten British pop acts were transported to the USA, where they were supposedly not known in the hope of revitalizing their music career.. The heat definitely affected him, because it made him thirsty. He was “travelling through the high deserts of California in June.” This is a very hot time of year, and when a person get lost without conserving water, which he had not done, a person get extremely thirsty. Not to mention the “sandblasted picture of a young boy pourng a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth,” which would remind the body of its thirst. So the setting most definitely affected the cyclist"
"In the story, the cyclist iS greatly affected by the features of the setting. For example, the setting has no thing for miles. Just ghost towns, makes it imposible to find any water. Also it’s a desert like setting, adding to his thirst.

It was June in California so it must have been pretty hot and also the town that he are to had no water because they seemed desorted. Another example is the state he put under his tongue. It’s a trick that lets you survive alot more effectively. Therefore the settings affected his journey and made him wish he didn’t take the old mans advice."
"Heat, abandoned roads, snakes all are reasons that affected the cyclist. The heat made him get dehydrated faster while he was using energy.

When the other old guy was about to tell him whereto go he said no."

"The author’s setting described a difficult terrain and harsh weather for bike riding. The author said that it was early summer which means it could be hot and uncomfortable weather for the cyclist. The author also that when the cyclist reached the first town, the sun began to heat down. That means the temperature is going to rise since the sun is getting stronger. Riding a bike in hot weather is very difficult because it takes a lot of effort and makes your body dehydrate faster because the heat makes you sweat which lowers your water retention.Viola (born 14 March 1951 in Torrazza Piemonte; died 5 February 2001 in Rome in a road accident driving his scooter) was an Italian professional footballer who played as a midfielder..He is a board member of the Community Broadcasting Foundation of Australia..The events were documented and broadcast on an episode of Gene Simmons Family Jewels..The year 2008 is the 1st year in the history of World Victory Road, a mixed martial arts promotion based in Japan.. Another feature of the setting that the author described was the cyclist’s location. He was traveling through the high deserts of California. This gives you a sense of how much hotter it is since he’s traveling through deserts during early summer while the sun is high. After the first couple town, he starts to ride on short, rolling hills. Hills take a bigger toll on a person’s body because it takes more effort to pedal up a hill."

"The setting is described by the author, were very challenging for three reasons, distance, water and the heat. All of these only occurred to multiply the effects of the others.The Italian highway 36, Lake Como and Spluga (SS 36) is a major road in Lombardy..WDCX's license is held by Kimtron, Inc. which is owned by Crawford Broadcasting..The accident disrupted East Coast rail service..It is strategically located at the crossroads of one of the busiest shipping routes in the world, linking Europe, the Far East, the Horn of Africa and the Persian Gulf.. As time had went on, the cyclist grew tired from the heat. In one sentence the effect of the heat were clearly described by the cyclist"
"The features of the setting effect the cyclist in many ways. The scenery makes the cyclist turn worried, unconfident, and in the end an ironic hopeful. The cyclist came upon the first “town”, and described it as only having “one ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corrall” I believe this is when the cyclist realized the men were a little off, and began to worry: he also couldn’t refill water supply, so fear of dehydration also kicked in already tired, the cyclist became unconfident when he came upon the sign reading, “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit”.Rapanea perakensis is a species of broadleaf evergreen plant in the family Primulaceae..In the United States, it received a viewership of 7.14 million in its initial broadcast..In 1930 Westminster City Council decided to improve access to Berkeley Square through creating an extra road into the square..Northern Lights is a 2006 comedy-drama broadcast on ITV starring Mark Benton and Robson Green.. Knowing that this was going to be a long and slow journey, the cycles becomes unconfident that he can make it, finally, when passing the sign saying, ""Gary and Wilber's fish camp – If you want bait for the big ones, we’ve your best bet,"" the cyclist reached a hopeful stage, because he knew he had found civilization once again. I believe your atmosphere and surroundings can effect your general mood, and that stands true today with the cyclist."
"The setting affects the cyclist becuse it is the passes is on a road much alot of hills it would affect him as being tired, or if the biter was in a place where the cold or hot it would affect him or his temp.. and by his attiude."
" The setting of where cyclsit takes there journey effects the cyclist. The reason I say that is because in the story “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” the cyclsit came upon a conflict with the setting.The first season of The Real Housewives of Dallas, an American reality television series, was broadcast on Bravo..It was known as Tyburn Road through the Middle Ages when it was notorious for public hangings of prisoners in Newgate Prison..The hospitality industry is a broad category of fields within the service industry that includes lodging, event planning, theme parks, transportation, cruise line,traveling and additional fields within the tourism industry..The nearest underground station to Royal College Street is Camden Town which is about 5 minutes to the south-west along Camden Road.. The conflict waas it was very hot and he did not use little things to survive witch he did. These are the reason why I say the setting of where cyclsit takes their journey matters."
 The cyclist was affected by long hours of riding the bike into the areas where he never been..
"In the essay, “Rough Road ahead"" the character sees many settings through his ride, all of which affect his mood and physical condition. For example, when the author describes one place he came to as, “one ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps and a corral that couldn’t hold in the lamest mute greeted me. Thes sight was troubling”, this was the turning point where the cyclist began to worry. He was running out of water, “The sun was beginning to beat down”, and he was probably tired of pedaling.KTFL was a religious television station in Flagstaff, Arizona, broadcasting locally on channel 4 as an affiliate of FamilyNet..No, No, Nanette was a popular show on Broadway, running for 321 performances, and was produced and directed by Harry Frazee..Individual counties may establish a numbering system to apply to roads that they maintain..BBC Arabic may refer to the Literary Arabic language radio station run by the BBC World Service, as well as the BBC's satellite TV channel, and the website that serves as an Literary Arabic language news portal and provides online access to both the TV and radio broadcasts.. But, to make matters worse, he came to rolling hills. This affected him because he had to work harder and had less water to pick him up. When he finally got to a “modernized” town his spirits were lifted, and he was able to get water to cool him down. This gave him more strength and will-power to continue his trip Yosemite park."
" In the essay rough road ahead the setting does effect the cyclist because he has been pedaling for so long and he is becoming dehydrated “I had been hitting my watter bottles pretty regularly. I was in the @LOCATION1”.A survey of economic literature on the subject, however, finds that most economists agree that some form of road pricing to reduce congestion is economically viable, although there is disagreement on what form road pricing should take..The William H.

Another reason the setting effects him is because he is starting to see mirages “A sandblasted picture of a boy pouring a refreshing glass of grape juice into his mouth could still be seen."
 The cyclist was riding his bike and was trying to get to rosemite and he had lack of water but he went on any way and he had to go past a snake and got scared..
"The setting in “Do Not @CAPS1 Posted speed limits” affects the mood of the cyclist in that every time the setting changes the mood of the cyclist changes. In the begining of the story the cyclist is riding through the “cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite.” @CAPS2 this time the cyclist is enjoying his trip and is in a positive mood.It began broadcasting on 1 October 1993..The village is connected by the old National highway road route..The boundaries of Dharruk are defined by Carlisle Avenue to the east, Popondetta Road to the west, Jersey Road to the north and Woodstock Avenue to the south..Situated at a distance of 13 kilometers from Chennai city and 2 kilometers from Guindy on the Mount-Poonamallee Road, the mosque caters to the Muslim population of the suburb and the nearby cantonment.. As the story goes on “there was no one in sight, not a building, a car, or structure of any land.” At this point in the story the cyclist has exchanged his positive mood for a desperate one as his water begins to run out."
"The features of the setting only drain the cyclist's willpower. The things he sees discourage him, for example one ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps and a corral that couldn’t hold the larnest, mule greeted me. This sight was troubling .” The desolation begins to wear away his hope of finding a building or town sometimes the things are psychologically damaging,” In an ironic twist that should please all sadists reading this, the building abandoned years earlier, by the looks of it – had been a Welch’s Grape Juice factory and bottling plant. A sand blasted picture of a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth could still be seen.Roaring rails is a phenomenon of short-wave corrugation observed in railroad tracks..For this road system the numbers 89 to 100 were used..Maryam Jalaliyeh is a road cyclist from Iran..The higher prominence given today to the presence of homosexual clergy, including bishops, in the life of the church reflects broader issues, both socially and ecclesiologically (see List of Christian denominational positions on homosexuality), concerning issues of social tolerance and the relationship between social change and doctrinal development..” For someone who is quickly running out of water, this this irony could make one lose their resolve to continue. The snake and rolling hills slow him down, and make him use more energy. The heat dehydrates the cyclist even faster. The environment is a hostile one for a cyclist.    "
"In this paragraph I will explain how the features of the setting affect the cyclist.

All things that the cyclist could not controll. Therefor affecting the cyclist while he rides through."
"The features of the setting affect the cyclist because if is very hot and is summertime.

Very hot, the water was also @NUM1 degrees! The text as states there were rolling hills and tumble weeds, so it must have been a desert kind of area. The trip was also a very long one, “about forty miles into the petal”, causing him to be tired. As you can see the setting was an area with no people, and it was very hot."
" The features in the setting would affect the cyclist because they would want to have towns with water so they can restock they’re water. They would want water even more after going up hills.As a follow-up to the first series, Ross Kemp: Return to Afghanistan, first broadcast from 1 February 2009, followed the 2008 deployment of the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders (5 SCOTS), the 5th battalion of the Royal Regiment of Scotland..It was broadcast by CBS-TV on Wednesday, March 26, 1980..A pre-recorded program, the show was a direct replacement for a live broadcast performed by Edmonds from the top of the then Telecom Tower annually on Christmas Day for five years, from 1984-88..The Braidwood Dispatch and Mining Journal was an English language broadsheet newspaper published in Braidwood, New South Wales, Australia..

Also the hills were a big problem to because of the heat and know water. Finally the other problem was he knew he was going to die and the birds would eat at him and their would be nothing left of him. This is how the setting affected the cyclist."
"The settings effect the cyclist by the roughness of the ride. First, they go over a bunch of rocks, and the tire could poys. Next it could be smooth and easy.Centenary Church, now desanctified and converted to a residence, marks the historic center at South Mountain Road near the intersection of Old Route 304..The play had received strong reviews across the country but was ""largely clobbered"" when it reached Broadway..The transmitter is located off Church Hill Road in Charlotte..The series is produced by Jenny Feterovich and Gary Bredow and is broadcast by PBS, Create TV Network and World Channel.. Also, it could be far away from towns and difficult to get back. There could be a lack of water making you dehydrate. That is how the setting around the cyclist could effect him."
"The setting desented in the story, “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Speed Limit,” would be a nightmare for any biker. This biker is riding in the middle of a desert on a summer’s day. The sweat dropping down him is just speeding up his dehydration. This is shown when the narration states, “wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that i could drop from heatstroke” (Kurmaskie).He is also the host of ""The Horne Section"", a live music variety show which has been broadcast on BBC Radio 4 and Dave..Leah Goldstein (born February 4, 1969 in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada) is a professional Israeli road racing cyclist..It started broadcasting on September 1, 2013..Colonization Roads were roads created during the 1840s and 1850s to open up or provide access to areas in Central and Eastern Ontario for settlement and agricultural development.. This show how hot the desert was, and how he could drop dead. The desert is also deserted with rolling tumbleweeds and giant snakes, as he passed abandoned towns and factories. The dangerousness for a biker in this area is very high. The biker was lucky to have made it out of those sorroundings alive."
"The features of the setting  affect the cyclist in many ways. The setting was a dry California desert, for if it had been a busting city, the events in the story would have not happened. The author asked a group of old men for directions to Yosemite National Park, and , “like a foolish yuuth,” folluwed their advice.Radio Thailand World Service is the official international broadcasting station of Thailand..KSLI then began broadcasting the Classic Country format that had been on KYYW..Its natural habitats are broadleaf, secondary and coastal forests..Gheen is an unincorporated community in Gheen Territory, Saint Louis County, Minnesota, United States; located one mile east of Gheen Corner on Willow River Road..

The road was straight but almost to the end there were many hills. Along with having to bike up the hills he almost ran into a snake. The weather was hot he had no water, he could have died."
"The setting of this story is a dry, hot desert in the middle of June. These features of the setting, effect the author, because it shows how he starts of strong + determained and his left weak + doubtful. In the begining of the story, the author says, “Things began well enough. I rode into the morning with strong legs and a smile on my face.” This is showing the readers confidence he has with himself before starting his trip. Later on in the story, he discribes the setting as “the high deserts of California in June.When applied broadly the term becomes indistinct from the principle of sola scriptura..The Weird Circle was a syndicated radio drama series produced in New York and originally broadcast between 1943-1945..On August 14, 2012, the station began carrying the NPR News Service of Northwest Public Radio, via a partnership between the Yakima School District, the Yakima Valley Technical Skills Center, and Washington State University, which also includes educational opportunities for students interested in broadcasting careers..America ReFramed broadcasts have won several awards including a Peabody Award and Alfred I. duPont-Columbia University Award for broadcast journalism..” He is discribing the heat + what he is facing. It goes on to tell how he is dehydrated in worn out. But he comes to a town, ""cool water drippen from my head as I slumped against the wall."" @CAPS1 he is relieved. As the setting changes, the authors attitude changes as well."
"In the story “Rough Road Ahead Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit"" the narrator is faced with the challenging and perilous desert he must cross. He wasnt traveling in a car, he was riding a bike and crossing a desert on foot is tiring enough let alone on a bike. ""The speed limit was @NUM1. I was doing a water depleting @NUM2. Sometimes life can be so cruel.It is the sole public emergency medical service covering Scotland's mainland and islands; providing a paramedic-led accident and emergency service to respond to 999 calls, a patient transport service which provides transport to lower-acuity patients, and provides for a wide variety of supporting roles including helicopter emergency medical services, specialist operations including response to HAZCHEM or CBRN incidents and specialist transport and retrieval..There are 3 roads to access Andawala by a vehicle..Liberalism in Mexico was part of a broader nineteenth-century political trend affecting Western Europe and the Americas, including the United States, that challenged entrenched power..United Christian Broadcasters (UCB) is an international Christian broadcasting and media group..” In the horrible @NUM3 degree heat the narrator gulps down his water bottles at such a rate that he’s at risk of running out. Not only that but he’s been pedaling for such a long time that he @MONTH1 pass out from exaustion or,.” I could drop from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June simply because I listened to some gentlemen who hadnt been off their porch in decades.” So I would say the narrator was pretty hasseled by his surroundings. "
"The setting in the story “Do not exceed posted speed limit” reflect upon the cyclist. In the story a cyclist is riding his bike and takes directions from some old men. Later he realizes the old men probably had no idea that things change overtime. He says “Never accept travel advice from a collection of old-timers who haven’t left their porches since carter was in office.”(Kurmaskie @NUM1).Now All Roads Lead To France is a 2011 non-fiction book by Matthew Hollis..The country began broadcasting wideband analog HDTV signals in 1989 using 1035 active lines interlaced in the standard 2:1 ratio (1035i) with 1125 lines total..Look East at their Norwich studio generally presenting forecasts on Tuesday to Thursday evenings whilst also presenting some forecasts for the weather hub at BBC Broadcasting House Hub..In the 1890s the railroad was said to be in a better financial position than its competitors and stood to make large profits once oil exploitation in the Gulf of Mexico began.. The cyclist takes the old-timers “shortcut” and it takes forever to reach his destination. At the end he reaches his campsite and another person askes him for directions. This time the cyclist says “Yes, sir! I own a very good map,” and “I’d always stick to it in the future.” The cyclist’s message is to follow a map, something you know is right, not a person that @MONTH1 be lying or irresponsible."
"The features of the setting affect the cyclist’s mood throughout the essay. Joe @CAPS1 starts with being happy and confident to determined yet help helpless and then to relief. Joe writes, “Things began well enough… flat roads…” This quote suggests that in the beginning, everything was okay. He started out with a “smile on the face.” (@NUM1) @CAPS2, things start to change @CAPS1 hits changing terrain. He writes, “…I noticed the terrain changing.

He starts to lose water to keep him going, yet he pushes himself to the next “town”. Finally, when the author reaches “Gary & Wilber’s fish camp” he is relived when he sees an old guy sitting. The two men say, “know The best way to get There? “Yes sir! I own a very good map.” This reveals that Joe didn t ask for more directions which was his first mistake. In addition, changes in setting can chang a persons mood and attitude."
"The cyclist’s features around him affected him negatively. He was cycling through “the high deserts of California in June” (Kurmaskie @NUM1). His water bottle was slowly running outand the only town he came to that had water had water that tasted like batteryacid. Events seemed pretty bad, until the speaker became elated when they saw a @ORGANIZATION1 factory. The author was thirsty and the side of the building had “A sandblasted picture of a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth” (Kurmaskie @NUM1).On 28 March 1933, an Armstrong Whitworth Argosy II passenger aircraft, named City of Liverpool and operated by British airline Imperial Airways, crashed near Diksmuide, Belgium, after suffering an onboard fire; all fifteen people aboard were killed, making it the deadliest accident in the history of British civil aviation to that time..WLEO (1170 AM) is a radio station broadcasting a Spanish Oldies format..He wrote theater play The Dark Room, a documentary Mughals of the Road..The show has been a part of the Fox News program lineup since February 12, 2007, and is the number one cable news broadcast in its time slot.. The building was abandoned. The speaker then states “Somehow  I climbed away from the abandoned factory of juices and dreams, slowly gaining elevation while losing hope” (Kurmaskie @NUM3). He lost hope after that landscape, and he pretty much gave up. The landscape or features affected the author very negatively due to the lack of water.    "
"In the essay “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” the features of the setting affects the cyclist in many ways. One thing is the water. There is little water and it is boiling hot.

Another thing is the land. The land went from straight to hilly. That started slowing him down. Last, is the day time. It started turning dark and he was still biking. He wanted to get as far as he could."
" Some features of the setting that affect the cyclist is he is riding a bike through the dessert. He says “I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.” So he was scortching hot peddling a bike. The road became bumpy and curry. A sign had said “Rough Road Ahead: Do not exceed posted Speed limit.KEOJ (101.1 FM) is a radio station licensed to Caney, Kansas, United States, broadcasting a contemporary Christian music format..Top Secret was a British TV spy series broadcast in two seasons on ITV in 1961-1962 which was produced by Associated-Rediffusion..Between Caersws and Cemmaes Road, the road appears to 'disappear', where it is traveling with the A470, which takes priority..Roadworks Temporary road closure during special events Police chase Robbery Sobriety checkpointIn peaceful circumstances, they are usually installed by the police or road transport authorities; they are also commonly employed during wars and are usually staffed by heavily armed soldiers in that case.. The speed limit was @NUM1 and he was going @NUM2 so it must have been hard to get over all the bumps. The lastly he comes across and poisioness snake blocked the majority of the pavement infront of me.” So him dehydrated trying to get ground a snake would be terrifying. So on his @CAPS1 the setting doesn’t help him much.  "
"The cyclist ran into many issues in his/her travel to @LOCATION1. They had to dismiss many hardships such as lack of water, being lost, immense desert heat, plus minor things like snakes and road conditions. The setting of the California desert in June was the most intense hardship.Childers Road Retail Park is a retail park on the Childers Road in Limerick City..Karween is a locality situated on the Redcliffs-Merringur Road in the Sunraysia region, south of the Sturt Highway..Produced by Made in Liverpool, the program was broadcast from studios at Toxteth TV in the Toxteth suburb of Liverpool..It is located off of the southbound lanes of New Jersey Route 23 on West Belt Road, near the interchange where Route 23, I-80, and US 46 meet, across from the Willowbrook Mall.. That and the lack of water. Though the heat starting powing at the cyclists’ brain by making them see mirages, etc. The heat and entire setting made the cyclists’ travel much harder."
"The setting affect the cyclist because in the hot heat of California in June which nobody wants to be outside. But first, was the heat which took a lot out of his body while trying to keep it cool. Then came the factor of which he had very little water when he reached the first town and in the story it said, “A tar like substance oozed out, followed by brackish water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees.” So now he has no cool water to drink when he says, “Not two miles into the next section of the ride, I noticed the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.It contains diverse recreational facilities and amenities, including campgrounds, disk golf course, equestrian facilities, archery range, off-leash dog park, bicycle/jogging roadway, nature trails, exercise trails, ball fields, an event pavilion, picnic pavilions, playground, and swimming lakes..Its studios are located at Noma Square in Downtown Greenville, and its transmitter is located off Massey Road in Pendleton..World Religions is an educational television show which was produced and broadcast by TVOntario (known at the time as the Ontario Educational Communications Authority) in 1973..It was broadcast each Sunday afternoon on the French national channel TF1 in 1984, from January 14, for 43 weeks, which had a certain impact on the beginnings of the French hip hop scene..” So the cyclist has very little water is not having to endoor the hardest part of the ride. Then later on he makes a mention to change a paragraph if he loss consciousness. Also he talked about him might getting a heatstroke. Hinting to the fact that the setting he was in was affecting him in many different ways."
"Anyone who has ever rode a bike knows how relaxing it can truly be, but when you are forced to ride miles and miles on @CAPS3 terrain without any water, relaxation feels like an oasis, @CAPS1 through beat-up roads with dryness all around you really puts a domper on your experience, @CAPS2  it extends your need for thirst by enhancing the amount of dryness in the air and the amount of energy you are having. The ability to block all of that out and trying to focus on something easier to handle is exactly what you want to do in these situations, @CAPS3 terrain can really build character into a cyclist, but  adding the fact the amount of water he had and the dryness around him, it sounds like torture.WZQY is an Adult Contemporary-formatted broadcast radio station licensed to Glade Spring, Virginia, serving Smyth and Washington counties in Virginia..The accident disrupted East Coast rail service..The other 15 were inducted for their accomplishments as drivers, owners and/or broadcasters..Co-founders, James Fisher and Tatiana Parent, founded Roadtrippers..

"The features of the setting affected the cyclist by lack of water, poisonous snake, the condition of the rode for example the lack of water affected the cyclist because he couldn't make it wi thout water he could of passed out if he didnt have water.

And the last example of how the setting affected him would be the conditon of the road because it make it tougher for the cyclist to get to his destination with hills and windy rounds this is how I think the setting affected  the  cyclist."
"The features of the setting affect the cyclist because he wasnt pre pared in the beginning, the cyclist got directions from an old man who hadnt left his porch in years so he wouldnt know what had changed.

Also in the @NUM1 degree whether with limited water supply, he couldnt ride up and down hills. Going down the hills gave him a break. Thats how the cyclist was affected by the settings features."
"Alot of factors effected the cyclist. Temperature, terrain, directions all gave the cyclist doubt. The temperature through the high deserts of california left the cyclist feeling hot, parched and irratable. Through the story, he had all but a few slips of his water left. Knowing your running low of water “to feel sorry for himself” The cyclist had biked so far the terrain started to change from flat to “rolling hills”. This could impact someone greatly who has never biked on different levals before.Tasya Fantasya is a 2016 weekly Philippine drama-fantasy-comedy series broadcast by TV5 starring Shy Carlos, AJ Muhlach and Mark Neumann..Her career took her to Latin America and even Broadway..Opened in 1983, the museum is operated by the city and features preserved locomotives, equipment and artifacts from the Tooele Valley Railway and other area railroads, and smelting and mining artifacts..It stars its creator and renowned Indian personalities like Big Boss 9, MTV Roadies (season 12) and MTV Splitsvilla season 9 winner Prince Narula, A VJ for MTV India Varun Sood (VJ), Freestyle footballer Archis Patil, Actors; Harman Singha, Dishank Arora, Vicky Arora and MTV Roadies X2 finalist and Splitsvilla season 9 winner Gurmeet Singh Rehal, MTV Roadies Rising winner Shweta Mehta, Finalist Baseer Ali and contestants Milan Verma and Samyuktha Hegde.. Lastly, the feeling of hoped could have effected him the most. Not believing in yourself is the hardest thing to overcome. Having just liesurly taken instructions by an old man cost the cyclist hours of torture. The author did a great job using hyperbole to exagerate the cyclists feeling of lost hope . He also used very detailed text to paint the reader a picture. These literay elements made it easier for me to understand the effect of the temp, terrain and hope had on the biclist."
" The features of the setting of were the cyclist are affect them very drastically. They need a water supply and if they don’t have one they might dehydrate or even die.

"It is said that, ""experience is a good substitute for @CAPS1 instinct.” This means if someone knows how to deal with the environment they're in they can survive even if they weren't born with the animal instinct that come with the territory. However, even the most experienced person can be overcome by the extreme weather conditions they live in.

Both stories represents man's quest for adventure, and also the canstrant struggle for survival that people face. "

"The feature of the setting including the conditions, weather, and amount of water can possibly decide the life or death of the cyclist. The conditions such as hills, and rocky roads can decied a future for a cyclist because if the rocky roads turn you off balance you could fall down a hill and give yourself an injury or possibly die. For example, in the short-story it says, “over one long crippling hill, a building came into view” This shows the conditions in which the cyclist had to deal with. In addition, the weather and amount os water can also decide the future. “The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips.Route 214 is a short collector road in the Canadian province of Nova Scotia..They maintained the home as a stop on the Underground Railroad, and the Haydens were visited by Harriet Beecher Stowe as research for her book, Uncle Tom's Cabin (1852)..The following radio stations broadcast on 97.6 MHz..Opened in 1832, it became part of the Pennsylvania Railroad system in 1871..

In addition, the heat isn’t helping him out any once he could die without anyone knowing. These reasons show us a cyclist needs to make sure they have enough water and the conditons and weather is right so they don’t make a life-threating choice."

The goast town which was completely and utterly desserted showing that the place is barren and unlivible these are some of the features the affect the biker."
"The cyclist is very discouraged by the dry and hot settings around him. A feature is something specific about some thing else. In ‘Rough Road Ahead. Do not exceed posted speed limit the cyclist takes the advice of a few old men that seems to be somewhat outdated, and gets him lost as he is running out of water and energy. The cyclist says “Over one long, crppling hill, a building came into view.The station is owned by Deerfield Media, as part of a duopoly with Mobile-licensed NBC affiliate WPMI (channel 15); Sinclair Broadcast Group, which owns Pensacola-licensed ABC affiliate WEAR-TV (channel 3) and Fort Walton Beach-licensed MyNetworkTV affiliate WFGX (channel 35), operates WPMI and WJTC under a local marketing agreement..Jamie Richards competed in the individual road race event at the 1976 Summer Olympics; he did not finish the race..When Tracy returned to pit road, he and Green nearly came to blows in plain view of television cameras and the crowd on the start-finish straight..The center of Mirror Lake village is the junction of Tuftonboro Neck Road with the Governor Wentworth Highway..

Also, the changed terrain affected how much water he drank and how hard he had worked just to get up that one long hill. The dry climate and tough terrain greatly affected the cyclist."
"The features of the setting affected the cyclist in positive and negative ways. At first, there were the two old men who gave the cyclist the out-of-date information.

"The different settings of the cyclist affected him by how he felt when he rode the bike on the rode. He was well excited and happy that he is going on the ride and how he truly felt about how he rode the bike real fast through the short cut.

"One of the biggest problems that the author faced in his essay was his surroundings. The setting of the story in Yosemite provided many obstacles such as the vastness of the park, the summer heat, and the fact that many places had been abandoned. The summer heat was the biggest problem for the cyclist. He had to bike many miles, but he only had limited supply of water. Eventually, his water supply began to run low, which increased his determination to find the next town before he collapsed. It is this determination which moves him from ghost town to ghost town and keeps the story moving.He was previously lead anchor for the Premier League's content service, available to international broadcast partners..Carole Hayman is an English writer, broadcaster, actor and director..A series of main roads connects towns to the highways, and local roads provide additional links..Hines is located in a remote and largely undeveloped area of the state along County Road 357 south of Steinhatchee Conservation Area and north of Cross City, Florida and U.S. Route 98 in Florida / U.S. 19.. Another big problem was the vastness of Yosemite National Park, which he was biking through. Any wrong turns (which he took, thanks to the direction he was given) could get him lost and thrown off track for a very long time. It was his confusion as to where the next time was that kept him biking, with difficulty and made for an interesting story. An example of the vastness of the park was when he quote, “About forty miles into the pedal, I arrived at the first ‘town.’ This place might have been a thriving spot at one time-say, before the last world war-but on that morning it fit the traditional definition of a ghost town.” This quote shows that even after many miles, he hadn’t seen a sign of anyone living, which would have increased his desperation to keep looking for civilization."
"The features in the setting in the story afects the cyclist in many ways. For example in the story it said, ”At same point, tumple weed crossed my path.” This is saying that he is in the desert or somewhere very hot because I know that you usually only see tumple weeds in very hot places. Thus, being in the desert affect the cyclist because he is already low on water then being  in a place as hot as the desert made him get even nor dehydrated.PEP invests across a broad array of industries and will invest in turnaround and growth capital transactions..De Berg Pass, is situated in the Mpumalanga province on the R577 road between Lydenburg and Roossenekal (South Africa)..The S&C Subdivision is a railroad line owned and operated by CSX Transportation in the U.S. state of Pennsylvania..The bridge is believed to be the only surviving ""upside down"" covered railroad bridge in the United States, in which the rail bed is laid on top of the bridge roof, whose purpose is to shelter the trusses below.. Another feature in the setting in this story that affected the cyclest is the hills he had to climb.

"The cyclist in “Rough Road @CAPS1; Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” starts off in the “serenity of an easly summer evening” taking road advice from old-timers. At first when the sun was beating down on him, he didn’t mind; the thoughts of Yosemite kept him determined. Later however, his determination was fading as he realized that his “short cut” was not so short after all. The “high deserts of California in June” and the terrain changed furthered his dehydration and need to find water. The emptiness of his surrounding with “no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind” made him focus on the horizon and tell himself that if he made it there, the he’d be alright.

Ironically it was an abandoned building. The cyclist describes it as a “Welch’s Grape Juice factory and bottling plant.” @CAPS2 this he had lost hope and hung his head. Believing he was going to die, the cyclist got back on his bike. Driving away from the factory, he saw a sight of a fish camp and immediately regained hope. Going there, he regained his strength and learned his lesson, never take road advice from other people.  "

"The settings affect the cyclist in many ways on the way to Yosemite.

But once he came to a bait shop, the old man asks  him if he  knows the best way to get to Yosemite, and he responds, “yes- sir: I own a very good map.” @CAPS2 by this he’s understood that the best way to travel anywhere is the path or road he knows because he’ll know what to expect.

 My point of view that affect a cyclist that people need to recycle sometimes people is throwing away trash can with soda in side of it people cyclist now in days some times they need to change that role my conclusion people need to save stuff to make some new things to make a good quality world of cyclist things..
"The features of the setting affect the cyclist by the changes the occur while riding his bike. The cyclist began well with smily face, but then he changed because the condition of the road and the weather that was hot, also there was not any signal to show him where he was going and it was the correct way he was taking.The 1977 Dan-Air/IAS Cargo Boeing 707 crash was a fatal accident involving a Boeing 707-321C cargo aircraft operated by Dan Air Services Limited on behalf of International Aviation Services Limited (trading as IAS Cargo Airlines at the time of the accident), which had been sub-contracted by Zambia Airways Corporation to operate a weekly scheduled all-cargo service between London Heathrow and the Zambian capital Lusaka via Athens and Nairobi..Tourist traffic was a dominant part of the motivation for building the line, and road tours to the Trossachs from Aberfoyle formed a significant part of the traffic..For example, the DEAS allowed the ability to broadcast ""bottomless"" audio messages (i.e. a message with no definite ending) and streaming video..Despite his injuries, engineer Daring walked two miles to the closest station to report the accident.. Also, his bike flat needed to be replaced."
"In the story the cyclist explains how the road goes from good to bad: An example,“ Rough road ahead: Do not exceed Posted Speed limit.. Also the dry."
 Well the setting was the lil boy was on the bike and he meets this old man and the man toke him a short cut.. So he took dis road and I guess something went wrong.

"In the story “Rough Road Ahead” a cyclist takes some out of rate information from a couple of old guys as he went along following there directions he found out that there directions were out of rate and at points dangerous. Also the setting didn’t help because he was in a desert with ghost towns and it was very hot it didnt help him believe he was going to make it out alive. For example in the story when he enters the  fork in the road it says he found “several rusty pumps,” and “one ramshackle shed.” This probably didnt help him because he didn’t have alot of water left and it was really hot and he was losing confidence in himslef that he went get out and there were rusty pumps so he couldn’t get any water that was good.D.

Also in the story it says that “There was no one in sight, not a bulding, car, or structure of any kind” and that setting affected him because in this part in the story he has cycled for a while and he has no water left and he is getting very exhausted a almost has no energy. Also it decreased his hopes because it says there wasnt a building, or a car anything so it was pretty, much a empty dessert that he was stuck in and he thought he wouldn’t setent of the dessert alive. In conclusion in the story “Rough road ahead” the setting in the story didn’t help the cyclist in his hope or confiendce of setting out because the setting was very abanded and also it was very hot and it didn’t help that he was in a desert."
" In this story the setting affects the cyclist in many ways. He tries to get directions but the people he asked really didnt know what they were talking about. Thats why you have to be careful on who you ask. Then he needs a drink but that dosent work out to well because the water ends up tasting like battery acid. Then the cyclist begins to be on his way again and finds same difficulty in the road.Gisbert is a German television series that was created by Hape Kerkeling and was broadcaasted 1999 by the WDR television company..WMGO (1370 AM) is a radio station broadcasting an Urban Contemporary music format..The station broadcasts with 2,000 watts of power..Situated in the Dhofar Governorate, on the Arabian Sea which is on the northern part of the Indian Ocean, it is centrally located at the crossroads of trade between Asia and Europe.. The same difficulty in the road. The road is in bad condition and must do slower then the speed limit. At this point it felt like he was gonna die. Lucky he found a bathroom and drank from the sink."
 I think the settings made it little more challenging to not letting give up also.. Also shows that you do better in life when challenged.
"THERE ARE VAST FEATURES IN THE SETTING THAT AFFECTS THE CYCLIST. IN SEVERAL WAYS ONE FEATURE WOULD BE THE “SUN BEGINNING TO HEAT DOWN,” AS THAT MADE THE CYCLIST HOT AND THIRSTY. THE THIRSTY-NESS REDUFROM HIM TO USE HIS LIMITED SUPPLY OF WATER. SO THE SUN WAS ABLE TO EFFECT HIM A COUPLE OF WAYS.Zavaleta (born June 15, 1980 in Bowling Green, Ohio) is an American model and actress, known for her appearances on the MTV reality series Road Rules: South Pacific, and as the November 2004 Playboy Playmate..Chottanikkara Road railway station (Code: KFE) is a railway station in Ernakulam District, Kerala, and falls under the Thiruvananthapuram railway division of the Southern Railway Zone, Indian Railways..In 1883 it opened the mission church that became St Michael and All Angels Church, Beckton Road..It is bounded on the north west by Terwillegar Drive, on the north east by Rabbit Hill Road, and on the south by a utility corridor located just north of 29 Avenue..

OBSTACLES SUCH AS “TUMBLEWEEDS” AND “PAVEMENT BLOCKING SNAKES” ALSO PLAYS A ROLE IN AFFECTING THE CYCLISTS AS HE MOVE ON THE “@NUM1 ROAD” ONLY DOING “12 MPH.” ONE FINAL, AND LAST OBSTACLE WAS THE TERRAIN HE RODE ON.

"In the story ""Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Limit,"" the features of the setting greatly affected the cyclist. As he was riding, he was passing through desert during June, a very hot month.There is not much water present in a desert (that would be part of the definition of a desert) and so, particularly in the even-hotter-than-normal June sun, he was at risk of running out of water. Had he been driving through, say, a forest or perhaps rolling grasslands, he might not have been in such danger, and could have merely looked for a river or dreck for water if he was desperate. Another thing that might have affected the cyclist would have been the affect of the desert on his mind.It is located south of West Plains on County Road 8470 between Route 17 and Route PP..In this article, the scope of the word ""alphabet"" is broadened to include letters with tone marks, and other diacritics used to represent a wide range of orthographic traditions, without regard to whether or how they are sequenced in their alphabet or the table..From observation, he has done many things better than his predecessors, however, he should have done more especially in asking or lobbying in the government for national projects such as building of a vehicle road which is key to development in Isabel which is also the longest island in the country with barely no vehicle road..It was broadcast live by the four major American television networks and all of the cable networks in the aftermath of the September 11 attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon in 2001.. When people think of deserts they often think of dry, barren wastelands, complete with buzzards and maybe a dead cowskull, as in movies. Deserts are in intimidiating, they have a bad reputation and so, as he was riding through and was low on water thought of death how he was, ""going to die and the birds would pick (him) clean"" running through his now-teriffied head. Had he been in a city or in rolling farmland he might not have been as terrified. There are people in those places, and places to be safe there, but, in his desert, he had neither, allowing him to give way to despair. Setting does a lot to influence stories, so it is important to keep that in mind when reading. "

"In the text, the author was cycling to Yosemite park through a desert which dehydrated him and changed his mood. Going through this desert he ran out of water so he stopped. Some of the  towns he was told of which turned out to be deserted, and as he could not find water there he soon because dehydrated.Lambert is now a regular supporter at Portman Road..The Carolina Western Railroad was a shortline railroad that served the South Carolina Lowcountry in the first half of the 20th century..Daystar is an American evangelical Christian-based religious broadcast television network that is owned by the Word of God Fellowship, founded by Marcus Lamb in 1993..A level junction (or in the United Kingdom a flat crossing) is a railway junction that has a track configuration in which merging or crossing railroad lines provide track connections with each other that require trains to cross over in front of opposing traffic at grade (i.e. on the level).. This is the obvious affect the setting had on him, another affect was to cause him to doubt old people and to change his mood from confident to desperate. As he was cycling through the desert, desperately chinging to life in hopes he could find, are water, he realized that old people know of the past better than the future as they don’t get out to the every changing world as much as they used to whereas, at the beginning he was confident in the directions and wisdom of the old men. The setting he was in made him a little more wise."
"The features of the setting affect the cyclist by dehydrating him. The cyclist said, “I toiled on. At some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake.""

The desert sun drying out his body. He said with each passing landmark, “I eased past trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state.”  @CAPS1 that the more he went on the more the desert affected him and dehydrated him."
"There were many land features that affected the cyclist and his trip. First of all, it is a desert, which greatly affects him as there is no water in deserts.The area is located on the outskirts of the outer urban area of Fishponds and consists mainly of three roads: Mayfield Park, Mayfield Park North and Mayfield Park South..The park is a popular spot for fishermen, and cyclists, walkers, inline skaters, and runners heavily use the park's roads and paths..Tai Po Road is the second longest road in Hong Kong (after Castle Peak Road)..Beninese children recruited for forced labor exploitation abroad are destined largely for Nigeria and Gabon, with some also going to Ivory Coast and other African countries, where they may be forced to work in mines, quarries, or the cocoa sector.. There was also a snake, which could have bit and kiiled him. As the road were not very well paved and had obviously been abandoned for years it made cycling much harder for him. And the juice factory just taunted him, making him remember his need for water, as did the well that did not pump cold water, but instead pumped hot,gross water"
"The features of the setting affect the cyclist in a few ways. first of these is the blazing heat. He is basically in a desert and he is running low on water. As he starts to run out of water he starts conserving it which is dehydrating him so he is becoming weaker, “I would conserve my water and go inward for an hour or so- a test of my inner spirit. Next up is the rough terrain. When you hit rough terrain on a bike it can get hard to keep going and the cyclist was already short on water “a large highway sign jumped out at me.The road goes through the local government areas of Waverley Council and the Municipality of Woollahra..Both the Minneapolis Great Northern Depot and the Milwaukee Road Depot were situated in the area, and numerous hotels and office buildings were constructed, including the Nicollet Hotel, the Hotel Vendome, the St. James Hotel, the Boston Block, and the Metropolitan building..In ""deniable password snatching"", a cryptovirus installs a cryptotrojan that asymmetrically encrypts host data and covertly broadcasts it..She briefly worked as a senior broadcast journalist for Mercia Sound in Coventry, then a freelancer for LBC in London, before joining the BBC in 1982.. I read: rough road ahad: Do not exceed posted speed limit sometimes life can be so cruel“. Finally is the structure First there was the Ghost town with the “battery acid” tasting water. Also there was the Welch’s grape Juice factory and bottling plant which were both probably dimeriling. “A sandblusted picture of a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth could still be seen. I hung my head”. As you can see the features of the settings generily affected the cyclist."
"The desert is the crulest of nature’s environments. Its lack of water, dry air, and punishing heat are enough to kill even the hardiest creature. When traveling through a desert, one must maintain a constant water supply and know their path with respect to the power of nature in “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit”, cycler Joe Kurmaskie must overcome the desert’s heat and lack of water to survive. As the author observes in paragraph @NUM1, “wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, I could drop from heatstroke.” If the human body overheats, it becomes sick and unable to properly function.The original station opened in 1855 and was sited further west than the second station (opened in 1899) which was just east of the B9006 road..The CN&L Subdivision is a railroad line owned and operated by CSX Transportation in the U.S. state of South Carolina..Dependent upon the program, a student working abroad may live in a dormitory or apartment with other students or with a ""host family"", a group of people who live in that country and agree to provide student lodging..Now the road is used for uphill traffic at all times.. When in the desert one must keep cool or perish. In @NUM2, Kurmaskie begins to realize the danger of running out of water in the desert, “ I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly, and I was travelling through the high deserts of California in June. “As this water starts to run out, Joe suffers from dehydration, despair, and a loss of balance. Water is essential in a desert environment, without it, as Joe observes, “the birds would pick (you) clean, leaving only some expensive out door gear”."
"The many features of the setting affected the cyclist in many different ways. The beauty of nature around him affected him by making him laugh. In the essay, it says, “ on a gorgeous day in June caused him to laugh.” This shows, despite what happened, he was might are on a nice day outside giving him an optimistic attitude.Khat is an important cash crop of this woreda, but because it is a very perishable commodity and must be cultivated not too far from major markets or good roads, it is grown along the main road..Previously it had the name Englewood, probably given to it by the Florida Midland Railroad..The railroad offered daily passenger service along the towns served via railbus and several freight trains a week..Roads to Judah was recorded in four days between December 2010 and January 2011.. Also, the beating sun affected him in a different way. It caused him to sweat and almost die of dehydration. “ growing realization that l could drop from heatstroke ” This shows that he was tensely aware that he could die from the suns might. So, the settings around the cyclist affected him in different ways."
"The features of the nearby setting affect the cyclist in a bad way. The four main things that affect him are the heat, lack of water, lack of nearby buildings, and @CAPS2. For this cyclist one of the biggest problems is the heat. He says” i was travelling through the high deserts of California in June”. this shows that it is quite hot outside by the month stated. June is quite a hot month especially in @CAPS1 deserts. The second problem is the cyclist lack of water. He says throughout the story how thirsty he is and how much he needs to drink some water. When he reaches the end, however he finds water.The road runs through mostly arable farmland in the East Donegal area..The federal government has committed $30 million, and the State of Connecticut has committed $20 million to construct a pedestrian bridge necessary to provide pedestrian access to the Museum over the main railroad track connecting New York and Boston..The Troy and Boston Railroad was chartered April 4, 1848 and organized November 22, 1849..Phillips Heights is located east of the intersection of U.S. Route 13 Business and Marsh Road northeast of Wilmington.. The third problem is when he needs water, he can’t find anywhere due to the lack of buildings. He pedals great distances trying to find “towns” nearby. Once he finds them, they are either “ghost towns” or are not useful at all. The final problem he faces is the @CAPS2. He says “At some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake… blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me.” @CAPS2 is getting in his way and not helping him to reach his destination at all. Truly . the features of the nearby setting are affecting him in a tramatizing way, because so many things like heat, lack of water , buildings, and @CAPS2 are inches way."
" The features of the setting affected the cyclist because he was really thirsty and then the dry air with no town nearby made it even worse. There was also the bumpy roads and hills that were tiring and mad the cyclist even thirstier.Road signs in Thailand are standardized road signs similar to those used in other nations but with certain differences..The David Greig shop at 54-58 Atlantic Road, Brixton, is no longer a supermarket, but the frontage, containing a ""DG"" cipher, remains relatively original, and although the full name has been removed from the facade it is still visible in the mosaic floor outside the recessed shop entrance..She represented her nation at the 1998 UCI Road World Championships..KLCS is one of three Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) member stations in the Los Angeles television market; the others are KVCR-DT (channel 24) in San Bernardino and KOCE-TV (channel 50) in Huntington Beach (which in 2011 replaced KCET as the primary PBS station in Los Angeles).. Finnally there was the factory that made him think about juice and made him thirstier yet."
 The features of the setting affect the cyclist by old people changing the definition of adon’t talk to strangers.. The main character
" The features of the setting affect the cyclist because real cyclist know what the speed is for a bike so you don’t need to tell them. If a cyclist needed some dierections they would go to a gas station not to some old person’s house. A real cyclist can go as long as they want before the stop because they are tired.It is located on U.S. 1/15/501, north of the road's intersection with North Carolina Highway 78..As the first phase of Philly Painting project, Haas&Hahn hired and trained a group of people to paint 50 storefront buildings on Germantown Avenue, east of Broad Street in North Philadelphia in 2012..The railroad has long since disappeared into history but it had been on Johnson Street..Its setting is the Earth of the far future, covered by ice and governed dictatorially by railroad companies.. A real cyclist knows haw to do tricks on a bike don’t have to do them over and over again to be able to do them. A real cyclist doesn’t have to train to go into a tourtement and win they must have to practice to be able to win."
"The cyclist is affected by the change in terrain from flat to hilly, the elderly men’s directions and most importantly his thirst. He tries to save what little water he has left for time when he really needs it. He looks for a place to cool off and get water, which he finally does in the end.Below is a list of radio stations operating in the territory of Albania and abroad..However, it was actually named after prominent railroad developer Henry B. Plant (see Plant System)..Footbridges are often situated to allow pedestrians to cross water or railways in areas where there are no nearby roads to necessitate a road bridge..Other common names include fleabane, tall fleabane, broad-leaved fleabane, white horseweed, and Sumatran fleabane.. He’s also a little bit angry and disappointed of the old men’s directions. He’s really going a lot more miles then he should be according to the directionsand he's beginning to wonder if they’ve lost it. "
"As the setting changes in the story, so does the cyclist’s narrator’s mood. His mood changes from happy and confident to indifferent and scared. At first the cyclist is so happy about Yosemite that he is just care free and no worries at all. He says that, “I rode into the morning with strong legs and a smile on my face.” Even at his first “ghost town” he just “chuckled, checked my water supply, and moved on”. After this point he could not be so care free. After this town he came to, “One ramshackle shed, several thirsty pumps, and men”.The National Film Award for Best Feature Film in Malayalam is one of the National Film Awards presented annually by the Directorate of Film Festivals, the organization set up by Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, India..We got great assistance from Ireland's greatest roadcrew, John McFadden and Leon Brennan..The Spanish never built an actual road south of St. Augustine..Currey Road Station was originally built to carry horses during the British Raj.. He said, “this was troubling”, it was very hot and he had been drinking his water pretty often. He said that, “He failed on."" He started to get sort of scared he realized that he could, ""drop from a heatstroke."" He was scared that because of his idea to believe the old men he might possibly die. He finally get happy when he reaches the bait shop and he got his drink. From then on the stock to his map. His attitude changed greatly throughout the story."
"The features of the setting did not help the cyclist on his trip. First of all he was in the desert on a bike! Which helped him dehydrate faster.The Road to Freedom is a 2011 War/Drama film directed by Brendan Moriarty in his directorial debut..The Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC) (often referred to as the Censor Board) is a statutory censorship and classification body under the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, Government of India..It is located in the City of Playford local government area, just north of One Tree Hill along Gawler-One Tree Hill Road..It provided a range of health care services including Accident and Emergency, General Medicine (including sub-specialties), General Surgery (including sub-specialties), Medicine for the Elderly (including Assessment, Rehabilitation, and Day Services), Orthopedics and a wide range of outpatient clinics.. Secondly, the ‘towns’ around the way  had been abandoned, leaving no place to get more water and no place to ask for directions. Lastly there were no other people around so if the cyclist was to get into trouble, he wouldn't be able to find help. "
"In the story, “Do not exceed postal speed limit,” many features of the setting affect the cyclist. First and most importantly, he is affected by the people who live there. “Never accept travel advice from a group of old- timers who haven’t left the confines of their porch since Carter was in office.” This quote describes the feelings the cyclist has towards the old men. Because he listened to their directions, he traveled through ghost towns and hourly died from dehydration. Also, the lack of people and civilization affected the author. There was no one around that he could ask for help from.The company is located at Spintex road, Accra-Ghana..Ronkonkoma is a major railroad station and transportation hub along the Main Line of the Long Island Rail Road in Ronkonkoma, New York..Turner was told thirty minutes before the broadcast that Stacey was the killer, and actors rehearsed several possible endings..In some ABC-TV Professional Bowlers Tour broadcasts during the early- to mid-1990s, Mazza served as a lane-level reporter.. “…but on that morning it fit the traditional definition of a ghost town. Here, the author is trying to stop for water, but since no one lives in the town any more, he gets none. Finally, the lack of water has a huge effect on the cyclist. “That smoky blues tune “Summer time” rattled around in the dry honey combs of my deteriorating brain.” This describes how the author is really dehydrated and he feels like his brain is drying up.
