 The affect of the setting cyclist the features in many ways. The features of the setting that affect the cyclist is the lact of information on were to go and the lack of water. This was a problem because he needed water for his trip and directions on were to go.
"I believe the affected of the cyclist him features because he was impatient and trustworthy he tock the old mens advice to take an hr of his time bay taking a short cat, if he would of stayed true to the mep he wouldn’t of almost ared of heat but his impatientress got the best of features so he took the shortcut. After his experence he new haes to stat ?? to the mep and not trust people who havent seen changes in the last few years."

"The essay “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not describes Posted Speed Limit” bicycle ride a man’s Exceed through California. Now, California is very hot during the summer, which is when the cyclist is riding. This setting greatly affects the man’s journey. It made it very difficult for him to finish his ride. He drank most of his water in the beginning of his ride so he gets very dehydrated. The text states, “The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips.” As you can see the setting makes this man’s bikeride very hard."
"Some affect of the setting cyclist the features. First the cyclist followed the old codgers advice of how to get to Yosemite National Park. Their advice was no use and didnt help her in the end. Next, “a tarlike substance oozed out” of what she thoot was going to be water. Then the terrain changed to “short, rolling hills”, which wasnt helping, her bike better. Lastly, ""tumble weeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake”, slowed her down. All of these road blocks in the setting affected the cyclist."
"The affect of this setting cyclist the features in many ways. The setting is a dessert so by common knowledge you know that it is going to be hot and dry. Because it is hot the cyclist needs more water because he is getting dehydrated. And when he is on his low of water because it is dry into mouth gets drys. @CAPS2 because he is in the dessert he sees wild sometime dangerous animals, in the story he sees a ridiculously @CAPS1 diamondbrock snake, which I believe are venomous, @CAPS2 ‘because ‘ of the extreme heat of the dessert he realizes that he had ??? chance of dropping from heatstroke. @CAPS2 the writer said that the dessert had short rolling hills and rough road ahead ??? would leave worn the cyclist out. Because of this terrain the cyclist way affects."
 The features of the settings affect in the story “Do Not posted Limit speed Exceed” it is the morning and everyone is still sleep and he wakes in the morning for something to do when he pull up to the first plase he thinks that they are all old and crazy and he thinking that the places needs fixing because the houses are falling apart. Then..leaves and see these wide bunch of hills. inconclusion I would never do all the riding he did.

"In the story many different affected author the settings in many different ways. In the very beginning of his journey he came across a ghost town. He reacted to the features of this setting with humor and hope. “I chuckled, checked my water supply, and moved on."" He still has hope that he would end up safe and in the right place. The next setting was an abandoned shed with a water pump and a fork in the rode. He grew worried when he saw that no near town was still in sight. “This sight was troubling” when the features of the next setting caught his eye he was desperate and devastated. “At some point, tumble weed crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake” He was on rough terrain in the middle of the desert with little water, when he reached the abandoned @CAPS1’s factory all his hope was lost and when he was planning his death. “I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean."" @CAPS2, when he reached the fish camp, he was relieved ""I had overwhelming urge to seek out Gary and Wilber, Kiss them and buy some bait.” He was overjoyed and overwhelmed because he had survived."
"are not place exactly the most inviting Ghost towns for a cyclis trunning low on water supply. In “Rough road ahead: do not exceed speed limit” the cyclist is affected in many ways by his surrounding settings. Starting off on a warm day with the sun bright start off as a good thing, while his mood is still fresh and happy expressions play on his face. But as he moves on he speaks of how “The sun was beginning to beat down” expressing his remorse of listening to the old men that led him on their “shortcut.” Along the road he comes to his first let-down, a ghost town with “one ramshackle shop, several rusty pumps and a corral that couldn’t hold the lamest male.” @CAPS1 he tries to pump the water from the corral but gets a “battery-acid” flavor and is forced to continue onward with little left to drink. This affects his mood to pity for himself and anger at the men who put him into the predicament. By the end he is relieved though when he comes to GARY & @CAPS2 FISH CAMP, a place with a working sink full of cold water. He says he “had an overwhelming urge to seek out @ORGANIZATION1, kiss them and buy some bait.” His thankfulness is expressed to men he doesn’t even know but because they were the light at the end of his long, dark and very exhausting tunnel."
"The affect of setting cyclist the features. It was hard arrived at the first town for author. For example “Rough Road Ahead: Do not Exceed Posted Speed Limit.” The road that author was ridding, it was rough. @CAPS1 example is “Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.” All the road was hills and rough. Than “The water bottle contained only a few tontalizing sips.” @CAPS1 doesn’t have that much water. That was really hard."
"The puts deal a great setting of stress on the cyclist. The biggest issue he faces is the weather. He is a cyclist “traveling through the high deserts of @LOCATION1 in June.” He had been riding his bike all day and he was soon going to run out of water. Just when he thought he could drink more water, he drank “water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees.” The weather being so hot and humid, did not help the cyclist throughout his journey. Another factor of the setting that affected the cyclist was the terrain. “Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills,” is a main problem the cyclist faced. These changes in terrain played into the fact that the weather did not cooperate. The hills made the cyclist work harder therefore use more energy. Luckily the terrain had a positive affect on the cyclist as well. The stones he found on the ground, helped keep his mind off the thirst. There were many factors of the setting that negatively and positively affected the cyclist throughout his adventure."
"The affected cyclist the setting a lot. One way was the heat. It got so hot that he was becoming dehydrated. He kept drinking his water, until he didnt have any left. Another reason is because the road turned into hills which made him use more energy. Finally, it didn't help that he hadnt seen any sign of living creatures except for a snake @CAPS1 how the setting affected the cyclist."
"are, dry, flat - all features Heat of the setting that effected the cyclist. As the cyclist was driving through the desert, he noticed how hot it was, and how he would become dehydrated quickley. I was also very dry and and he started to get nervous about how thirsty he was. The flat ground models how there is nothing around that can help the cyclist, which made him scared. The story also metions that he is a ghost town"

"In the story “Do not exceed posted speed limit” by Joe Kurmaskie were things many there that effected the cyclist. Such as the water. He had no really good water to drink because of where he was''. When I tryed a drop or two, it had the flavor of battery acid''. He wasnt able to drink the water because the battery acid'' that was in it could have made him very sick. Also the unstable roads that he had to bike through made things hard. ''Rough roads ahead'' To ride on unstable ground can be very hard to do. So just these two examples, the water and Rough roads made the features of the setting deffinitly effect the cyclist."

 The affected cyclist the setting because of the rode conditions. The rode was all messed up.
 The affects cyclist the setting in many ways. The setting affects the cyclist because the weather is very hot and humid which makes him sweat which is using up energy because his body is trying to stay cool. Also the setting affects the cyclist because there is no water so on top of sweating being out of energy he has no water to refuel his body which makes it very hard for him to keep going.
"The affects greatly cyclist the setting because he is the one riding over, “short rolling hills,” and arround a,“ridiculously large snake,” and because its hot he could suffer from heatstroke at any minut. So yes the author is affected by the setting"

"The give of the setting in Yosemite cyclist the features something in look forward to, but the feature of the sorting that he is in enduse in get there causes him despaire. As soon as the cyclist passes a ghost town and notices swettering hed of the sun during early endeavers of the trip he checks himself up as he says,""I brely noticed it [the sun], the cool pines and rushing hills of Yosemite had my name written all over them. Although the cyclist began to feel the toll that the trip and the sun was going to take on him, he erased the morning with the hope and bealy of arriving at Yosemite. The more the cyclist noticedthe sun the more he drank untill his water supply seemed low, striping as an old rusty water pump he had hope of being replenished but the taste of bitter battery acid caused the cyclist to stop drinking. The rolling hills, Sun and tumbleweds did nothing to quech the cyclist thirst or at least divert his assertion. If the cyclists was to see a sign that said Yosemite @NUM1 miles away his spirits would have risen, instead he saw a sign that said, ”Rough Road Ahead” which did nothing to help him. If the terrain was more poporsed, easier to travel on and in plenty supply of water, the tune of this passive would be more hoped instead in such despair, the features of the setting caused the cyclist grief instead of hope."

"The affect and features cyclist the setting because with each building he hopes for water, but since he is traveling through a desert water is in limited supply and many empty buildings are left out in the wastland. These buildings create a feeling of releve in the cyclist anty to be followed by despair to find them abandoned. The land with no features also creates a feeling of lost hope in the rider making his entire ordeal that much harder. Over all it was an excureiatly experience physicly and mentaly for the cyclists."

"Tsaw cyclist was so set on seeing cool, piney trees and lakes, that wsawn saw dirt he, snake, and no source of civilization worried him. More affectively, what he didn’t see scared him most. He did see windy rivers or trails hidden beneath all kinds of trees. He didn’t see any people or friendly little forest critters. Instead he just saw the same rusty color of dirt and the occasional snake. His mood was affected and he started to lose confidence and hope. He wasn't used to the new surroundings and for a while doubted if he could even make it out alive. When he came across the run-down building of Welch’s factory, he was even more distraught. Fortunately, he did find civilization when he came to a fishing supply shop. This definetly boosted his spirits. Once he had saved his thirst problem and assured himself he has alive and would luckily stay that way, he sat down before wading out again in search of his destination."

"The affect cyclists the settings for many reasons. One, if the setting is nice, the rider can concentrate on the scenery not on only pain they are having. also, if the setting isn’t very nice, the rider would probably concentrate more on the pain than they would the scenery. another thing is if the setting is very hilly & the rider has to drive over it, it @MONTH1 not feel the greatest. The cyclist would get even more pain than before plus the cyclist could could get dehydrated faster, the setting really does affect the cyclist."
 are features numerous There in the setting that effect the cycleist. For example  the rough road. A nother example is the tumble weed and the snake also affected the cyclist. In conclusion those are the reasons the setting affects the cyclist.
"The affect of the setting cyclist the features because it is hard to go far on a bike when the place, you are ridding is dry, abandoned, a quiet, hot cold and straight forward. It tells you that the setting is abandoned when if says “there was none in sight, not a building, car or structure of any kind"". This would make it hard for a cycler because you need a good water supply and thats hard to keep when there is nothing around."

 The choose to take cyclist an old abandoned route to @LOCATION1. The route had in some places no buildings at all to see making the cyclist loss hope of his need for water. Until the end there was no one on the route making him all alone. So if something happen who would know. During his adventure he ran out of water making him dehydrated that didn’t help. The setting of the story seems tragic to the cyclist.
"are ways many There that the setting affected the cyclist. One way is in the story when it says that it was very hot, he could become dehydrated and could possibly have a heat stroke, also the rodes were windy. This could be a problem because hes tired so he might not be able to go around the turns, he might just keep going straight and then get lost even more. That is all about how the features of the setting affect the cyclist in the story."

"The affects cyclist the setting in a large way. He has a hard time going on his journey. He began to lose hope, get tired, and began to think he was going to die. The settings played the biggest role. It was very hot with no people or buildings around him. He had very little water and no place to get anymore. He then encountered a large snake which made it worse because he was in fear with no one around to help him. If he would have followed his own directions instead of the old men he would not have had this problem. The setting around him really made his trip a hard one with no water, people, towns, or buildings around him."
"In the stories, don’t exceed posted speed limit, are settings some very descriptive there. In the stories these settings have a great effect on the cyclist. Through these our settings the effects change. Some good effects some harsh effects. The first setting that is described do you is, ""the cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite had my name written all over them."" This setting gives you a vivid picture of were the cyclist is heading. This setting also establishes a happy sort of mood. Let the pretty picture is about to change. Not so much further in to the cyclist ride he noticed a change of terrain,"" flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills."" @CAPS1 the cyclist is short on water, and is becoming very tyered. Seeing this just crushes his spirit. @CAPS1 riding hills hard, but ridding hills with our knowing of something good waiting for you on the other side of the hills. Both of these, very different settings gives off very different feeling. The first one makes you think he is going to have as easy enjoy able bike ride. But this all changes when he hit those horrible hills. Just the thought of having so ride over miles of hills, makes your legs hurt. Over all the features of the setting saposed an intense bike ride for the cyclist, followed by a reward by beautiful place."
"The is in thdesert short story “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” desert a hot, sunny setting, in which all towns have been abandoned, “The sun was beginning to beat down” (@NUM1) “ i arrived at the first town it fit the defination of a ghost town (@NUM1) trational.

"The affects of the setting cyclist the features because the worst the affects get the more he wants water. For example, in the essay it said at some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculous large snake blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me when I think of tumbleweeds I think of dryness because it is like dry grass and when I think of snakes I think of heat because that is the time for snakes to come out when ot gets hot. So the cyclist was thinking about dryness of his throat and the dryness of his sorrounding making him want water. Another feature is when he seen a sandblasted picture of a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth probably making the cyclist wishing he could have that cold refreshing drink."

 The affect of the setting cycleist the features in many diferent ways. For example it was June and he was in the @CAPS1 of California. It was very hot and the dehydrated him. Also he did no know where he was going so he had to rely on other people directions. Also he had to keep dehydrate. That what affected the cycleist.
"The affect’s of the setting cyclist the feature because, the feature is dehydrated and has to nde on a horrible conditions of a road, snakes and hills. All of these features act like obstacle courses, which makes it hard to do what he’s trying to do which is recieve water. Also, with the cyclist being hot and in need of water he at this point is delinous and most likely doesn’t know whats going on. In the story the authors main feature of the setting is the road. “Rough road ahead.”  This explains the cyclist having to go on a rough road, and doing that dehydrated is very dangerous these are some of the features of the setting that affect the cyclist."

"The affected of the setting on the way to Yosemite National Park, greatly cyclist the features. On the way to the park, the cyclist had encountered the heat of the desert in California. Besides the heat the cyclist had to overcome the rough terrain of the of the short, rolling hills. This made the cyclist tired and weary. Adding to his weakness, and the extreme heat, he also ran out of water, causing him to become dehydrated. “Wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from a heat stroke...laugh.” This trip through the California desert greatly affected the cyclist by causing great exhaustion and dehydration."
 Some features of the setting setting affected cyclist the that were signs affected had speed limits. The sign affected the speed of the cyclist. Another feature was a hill on the route. This affected the cyclist by making him tired because he said “I wipe the sweat from my eyes.”

"In the short story “Do Not Posted Limit Speed Exceed” by Joe Kurmaskie. the setting greatly affects the cyclist and his mindset. When the scenery is pretty and cheery, he is happy as well. This is shown when the author writes, “denyoved the serenity of an early- summer- evening.” This quote describes the scenery as a serre or peaceful place. His happiness is found in the first part of the quote when he said, “denyoyed” One does not enjoy something unless they are happy or in a cherry mindset. Therefore, the peaceful scery affected the cyclist by making him happy. the same can be said for merry scenery too. This is found when the author says, “At some point, tumble weeds crossed my path and the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke”. This quote, describes the scenery as a place that they tumbleweeds. Steryotypically, tumbleweeds are found in dreary and lonely place. This lonely scenery takes it if full on the cyclist. He becomes pessimist and is making of all that could go wrong, not all that could get better. This is found around us every day. The poor and homeless who live with a low standard of living are often said. They have to exist with the affected the cyclist. In conclusion, the seeing does affects the cyclist and his mindset drastically."
"The Do not exeed in “speed limit posted terrain” by Joe Kurmaskie the cyclist had to cope with many difficulties. He was already lacking water from the anduous journey and then the enviroment turned against him. The narration states, “I noticed the terrain changing flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.”(Kurmaskie @NUM1). This means the cyclist is going to put forth more energy to make it up these hills. Energy he barely has. This  will drain almost all the energy the cyclist has. Another example is, “At some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path”(Kurmaskie @NUM1). This means that the cyclist is in the middle of nowhere with barely any water and energy, causing even more problems. In conclusion, the setting in, “Do not exceed posted speed limit” by Joe Kurmaskie caused many problems for the cyclist."

"The affected of the setting cyclist the features in many ways. He was riding his bike across a place with no cars, no people, no water, or no food. It was a dangerous journey for him but he made it."
 The affect of the setting cyclist the feature about old timers giving him wrong information about taking this short cut he was going to take. Running out of water and energy and he was doubt himself and giving up on race It say he.
 Twas going feature of twas going setting affect twas going cyclist about old timers giving him wrong information about taking this short cut was going to take he. Running out of water and energy and he was doubt himself and giving up on race It say he.
"In the story “Do Not Posted Limit Speed Exceed” the features of the setting effect the cyclist. They effect the cyclist’s confidence, and hope. I say this because through out the story he sees things that would consern other people like the towns that are suppose to be the best end up “Ghost towns” and the road from flat to hills. Yet he continues on and then says “what I believed was my last burst of energy,” “I was going to die.” The cyclist dosent think he can continue but manages to keep going hoping that the next horizon to see a building or something. Hope saved his life because if he knew he could not continue that he could die."
"The affected of the setting cyclist the features in many ways. Like he was in a desert, no one to give him good information, no towns close by that are still running, it was a hot summer day, no water near by. These affected the cyclist because they made him not sweaty, dry mouth, no energy, and he was having alot of doubt that he was not going to make his journey alive. In the story they cyclist said, ''I picked up some pebble and put them in my mouth. With my luer. I'd hit a bump and lodge one in my throat. It didn’t really matter. I was going to die. ''When he said that he showed alot of doubt. Everytime he got to a town or bulding it was abandoned. He saw an abandoned  building witch was ironically a Welch's Grape Juice factory and bottling plant. That made him even more thirstier. Thats how the features affected the cyclist."
"The cyclcausets problem in Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit by ""@PERSON1"" cause dehydration and the is cause the California terrain. California is full of long deserts that can exceed @NUM1 degrees in sammer, and the cyclist was exerting himself so dehydration was inevitable. In the story the cyclist says “I could drop from a heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June” so the setting is obviously a hazard."
"The affect of setting cyclists the feature because if you are a guy and you ride a bike then you might have to where about falling of your bike, or out of water. I you keep at a fast past and don’t have any water then you can get dehydrated. In the essay it tells how he had ran out of water and he thout he was going to die he had gotten dehydrated but lukly he had find some were to get something to drink"

 The affect of setting cyclist the features in many ways. At first when he sees the tall pines and the river he is calm: and chilled out. But when he sees the abandoned “@PERSON1’s Grape Juice” factory he becomes desperate and thinks he is going to die out in the desert. A guy travels to @ORGANIZATION1 where he meets “old timers and the give him a “shortcut” to the park. He then goes on his bike to the park taking their “shortcut.” While traveling starts to run out of water and then he thinks he is going to die out in the desert. “It din’t really matter. I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean.” This quote means now that he is out in the desert he thinks he is going to die since he has no more water. This relates because he becomes desperate  for water because he is out in the desert in the midde of June.
"The can affect cyclist the features very well or not. I depends on what condition happening. For example, he could fall. Does he have a traveling first aid kit."
"The affected of the setting greatly cyclist the features. For example, the cyclist was in California, which is an extremely hot place in the desert in June. These features made dehydration a more keen possibility. Another example, is paragraph ten. It explains how the rough road, tumbleweeds, and large snake made it hard for the cyclist to keep his balance without water. Also, the essay describes a building with a poster of a small child drinking a refreshing glass of juice,this made the cyclist think more about water and  become very thirsty. Although thier was some possitive effects of the setting on the cyclist. The pebbles aloud him to keep his mouth moist and not think so much of his thirst. Also, the bait shopped allowed him to opt something to drink, and not die from dehydration."
 The harsh made in “DO Not Exceed Posted Speed limit “by Joe Kurmaskie @CAPS1 the setting for the cyclist more difficult due to the hot weather and the inconsistancy of the pavement. The very hot June day was a cause of the cyclist slowing down. “wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt and the growing realization that I could drop from heat stroke on a gorgeous day in June.” This proves that the cyclist is very hot due to the summer heat. Another factor of the cyclist slowing down is the inconsistant of the pavement on the road “Flat road was replaced by short rolling hills.” The @CAPS2 proves that the road could be slowing the cyclist also. It seems the cyclist has a lot against him. But if he keeps his head up he can make it to “Yosemite.”
"Several features of the setting affected cyclist the that were time of year, the desert land, the lack of civilization, the lack of resources – especially water, and the rugged characteristics of the land. The cyclist was traveling during the summer time, which was the hottest time of the year. He was also traveling through the deserts which create an even hotter climate. “I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June,” was a quote from the selection that tells us this. If he had been traveling in the @DATE2, for example, he @MONTH1 have been more comfortable. Throughout his trip, the author does not after come desert civilization. He runs into a deserted factory and miles of land without people. The fact that he is traveling through desert terrain also helps us realize that water is scarce. He has trouble finding a place to get water. This made the trip extra hard and discouraging. “I was going to die” he says. As he travels farther, the land also becomes harder to travel on. “Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills” this characteristic is a setting, like the others, negatively affects the cyclist by making his journey harder."

"The affect of the settings cyclist the features in many ways when he starts of, he is bright and happy just as the slenecy is nice and calming. There is a pace that makes him feel like nothing wrong. “I rode into the morning with strong legs and a smile on my face.” After about @NUM1 miles on the cold, his life was getting low, and he came to his second abundant place. He then felt a little disturbed and worried. He needed to find a place with water. “This site was trebling.”  There he fins water plant not his hopes rise a bit, until he finds the water isn’t good. “A tarlike substance oozed out, followed by brickish water feeling some which is in the neighborhood of two hundred trees”. So he moves on and finally he re aches life! He is so relieved he can’t believe his luck.” Then as easily as rounding a body my troubles, thirst and fear were all behind me “The setting affects the mood in a very big way, the cyclist feels as the setting looks."
"The setting in “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not @CAPS1 Posted Speed Limit” state the cyclist's physical and mental Exceed. There are negative and positive effects for each state. The physical effects of the cyclist because of the settings all apparent throughout the story. For example, the cyclist reaches @PERSON2 and @PERSON1’s Fish Camp, he is able to hydrate once again. The positive effect makes the cyclist healthy and safe once again. The setting mentally, @CAPS1 the cyclist very substantitially. This can be seen when the cyclist in the comfortable camp around in @LOCATION1. He feels happy in this area. This positive effect prepares the cyclist to go on the trip to Yosemite. Also, when the cyclist reaches the “Ramshackle @CAPS2, several rusty pumps, and a corral, “he feels troubled. He is negatively affected mentally by the little amount of available water. In addition, the cyclist felt ""sad"" and ""hopeless” when cycling in the Dry, arid terrain. The cyclist is in the worst mental state in this place. Finally, the cyclist felt relieved upon seeing the fish camp. He describes the feeling by saying that his trouble are now “behind” him. Settings positive effect in this instance changes mental state from negative to positive. Setting was the main factor in deciding upon the cyclist’s physical and mental state. Setting @CAPS1 the cyclist’s physical and mental state in positive and mental states almost equally in the story."
"The effects of the essay, “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” cyclists the setting physical and emotional attitude. In the beginning of the essay the cyclist, “rode into the morning with strong legs and a smile on [his] face.” It was not too hot yet in the morning. So, the cyclist was happy and strong. He was confident he could conquer anything. As the day grew on “the sun was beginning to beat down” He was beginning to drink lots of water but he was still confident and strong. “I came to a ramshackle shed [and] several rusty pumps the sight was troubling. “The cyclist was travelling in the hot deserts of California. He was becoming tired and thirsty. He had to save as much water as possible. What started as a confident ride into the desert became a survival ride. Once the cyclist findswater he is relieved. He feels more confident and can ride to his destination. The weather and setting can affect us emotionally and physically just like in the essay, the cyclist became tired both physically and emotionally as the hot, sunny day went on."
"The hot, dry, and baron affect cyclist the setting greatly. Baron is a hot, dry and abanded place. The cyclist is trying to ride his bike to Yosemite national park. He decides to follow the directions of coaple old men, which was a mistake.”…Simply because I listened to some gentlemen who hadn’t been off their porch in decades,”(Kurmaskie). The hot and dry conditions made the cyclists hardest obstacle to be staying hydrated."
"The affect of the setting cyclist the features in many ways. Ranging from temperature, surroundings, and the availability of water. First of all, the cyclist felt tired and exhausted because of the temperature and terrain, For example, “I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.” I can imagine the cruelty of the heat beating down on him while riding down the roads. It would make me tired and exhausted also. Second of all, the surroundings as he rode affected him and made him have less confidence as he rode further. For example, “This place might have been a thriving little spetatore time say, before the last world war-last on that morning it fit the traditional definition of a ghost town.” It shows how the information he had been giving caused him to feel unsure of where he was going. I’d feel uncapable and would do the same in his situation. Lastly, the lack of water made him scared. For example, “conserve my water and go instead for an hour or so a lest of my inner spirit.” It made him think the situation wasn’t good. So as one can see, it affected the cyclist in many ways."
"In the essay “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” the uses features author of the setting to show the effects of the cyclist. In the essay the rider gets directions from two old men on a perch. In the essay it said, “Never accept braid advice from  a collection of old- timers who haven’t let be able centres of their porch since carter was in office. “This shows the old man could be wrong and places can change. Also, on this short cut he almost runs out of water. The essay ststed I would conserve my water and go inward for an hour or se – a test of my inner spirit. He is running out of water but has the determination to get to @CAPS1 last the terrain affects him. The Hills prove to be a challenge with a limited supply of water. The essay states. Flat roads were upleed by sheed, rolling hills. This shows he is extremely determined. Even though the hills added to the struggle he made it through. That is how the author used features of the setting to add to the struggle of the cyclist."

 The affected of the setting cyclist the features because they figured that they were old enough and seen what was going on and been through that situation that they were well experienced and knew more about what was going on so the people should listen to them.
"After the cyclist spoke to the “old timers had n’twho left the confines of their porches since Carter was in office,” his confidence in them began to ware. He entered the desert happy, hopeful and determined. As his water reservoir began to disappear, and he approached the sight of the old shed, canal and a couple water pump, he began to feel touched. He made an attempt to get the water from the pumps and it was hot and “tested like battery acid”. As he rode on, his confidence only faded more. He travelled through the desert and “ridiculously large snake” and was running low on water. Finally he saw a building in the distance, which ironically enlights was an abandoned juice factory a sign featuring a left sipping on some succulent icy liquid teased ruin, and he began to lose hope. He didn’t think he would make it to his destination or anywhere else for that matter. Although after approaching the old factory, he came across a bait shop where his hope and energy was founded."

"The affected in “Rough Road Ahead: Do not exceed posted speed limit,” cyclist the setting greatly. For starters it says he was “traveling through the high desserts” which is never a safe thing. He had been drinking he water regularly but the temperature was rising. He was, “trying to keep balance in my dehydrated state.” From lack of water because the terrain had altered his water into “A far like substance” The setting of the story was cruel to the cyclist."
 The affect of the setting cyclist the features in a couple different ways. When the cyclist found the gohst town since no one was there he could not ask someone for better directions or get some food or water. The short rolling hills make it harder to pedal because it is hard to pedal uphill. At the end of the story he found a bait shop where he got water and better direction's.
 The affect of the setting cyclist the features in many ways. The features of the setting that affect the cyclist is the lact of information on were to go and the lack of water. This was a problem because he needed water for his trip and directions on were to go.
"I believe the affected of the cyclist him features because he was impatient and trustworthy he tock the old mens advice to take an hr of his time bay taking a short cat, if he would of stayed true to the mep he wouldn’t of almost ared of heat but his impatientress got the best of features so he took the shortcut.

"The essay “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not describes Posted Speed Limit” bicycle ride a man’s Exceed through California. Now, California is very hot during the summer, which is when the cyclist is riding. This setting greatly affects the man’s journey. It made it very difficult for him to finish his ride. He drank most of his water in the beginning of his ride so he gets very dehydrated. The text states, “The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips.” As you can see the setting makes this man’s bikeride very hard."
"Some affect of the setting cyclist the features. First the cyclist followed the old codgers advice of how to get to Yosemite National Park. Their advice was no use and didnt help her in the end. Next, “a tarlike substance oozed out” of what she thoot was going to be water. Then the terrain changed to “short, rolling hills”, which wasnt helping, her bike better. Lastly, ""tumble weeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake”, slowed her down. All of these road blocks in the setting affected the cyclist."
"The affect of this setting cyclist the features in many ways. The setting is a dessert so by common knowledge you know that it is going to be hot and dry. Because it is hot the cyclist needs more water because he is getting dehydrated. And when he is on his low of water because it is dry into mouth gets drys. @CAPS2 because he is in the dessert he sees wild sometime dangerous animals, in the story he sees a ridiculously @CAPS1 diamondbrock snake, which I believe are venomous, @CAPS2 ‘because ‘ of the extreme heat of the dessert he realizes that he had ??? chance of dropping from heatstroke. @CAPS2 the writer said that the dessert had short rolling hills and rough road ahead ??? would leave worn the cyclist out. Because of this terrain the cyclist way affects."
 The features of the settings affect in the story “Do Not posted Limit speed Exceed” it is the morning and everyone is still sleep and he wakes in the morning for something to do when he pull up to the first plase he thinks that they are all old and crazy and he thinking that the places needs fixing because the houses are falling apart.

"In the story many different affected author the settings in many different ways. In the very beginning of his journey he came across a ghost town. He reacted to the features of this setting with humor and hope. “I chuckled, checked my water supply, and moved on."" He still has hope that he would end up safe and in the right place. The next setting was an abandoned shed with a water pump and a fork in the rode. He grew worried when he saw that no near town was still in sight. “This sight was troubling” when the features of the next setting caught his eye he was desperate and devastated. “At some point, tumble weed crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake” He was on rough terrain in the middle of the desert with little water, when he reached the abandoned @CAPS1’s factory all his hope was lost and when he was planning his death. “I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean."" @CAPS2, when he reached the fish camp, he was relieved ""I had overwhelming urge to seek out Gary and Wilber, Kiss them and buy some bait.” He was overjoyed and overwhelmed because he had survived."
"are not place exactly the most inviting Ghost towns for a cyclis trunning low on water supply. In “Rough road ahead: do not exceed speed limit” the cyclist is affected in many ways by his surrounding settings. Starting off on a warm day with the sun bright start off as a good thing, while his mood is still fresh and happy expressions play on his face. But as he moves on he speaks of how “The sun was beginning to beat down” expressing his remorse of listening to the old men that led him on their “shortcut.” Along the road he comes to his first let-down, a ghost town with “one ramshackle shop, several rusty pumps and a corral that couldn’t hold the lamest male.” @CAPS1 he tries to pump the water from the corral but gets a “battery-acid” flavor and is forced to continue onward with little left to drink. This affects his mood to pity for himself and anger at the men who put him into the predicament. By the end he is relieved though when he comes to GARY & @CAPS2 FISH CAMP, a place with a working sink full of cold water. He says he “had an overwhelming urge to seek out @ORGANIZATION1, kiss them and buy some bait.” His thankfulness is expressed to men he doesn’t even know but because they were the light at the end of his long, dark and very exhausting tunnel."
"The affect of setting cyclist the features. It was hard arrived at the first town for author. For example “Rough Road Ahead: Do not Exceed Posted Speed Limit.” The road that author was ridding, it was rough. @CAPS1 example is “Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.” All the road was hills and rough. Than “The water bottle contained only a few tontalizing sips.” @CAPS1 doesn’t have that much water. That was really hard."
"The puts deal a great setting of stress on the cyclist. The biggest issue he faces is the weather. He is a cyclist “traveling through the high deserts of @LOCATION1 in June.” He had been riding his bike all day and he was soon going to run out of water. Just when he thought he could drink more water, he drank “water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees.” The weather being so hot and humid, did not help the cyclist throughout his journey. Another factor of the setting that affected the cyclist was the terrain. “Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills,” is a main problem the cyclist faced. These changes in terrain played into the fact that the weather did not cooperate. The hills made the cyclist work harder therefore use more energy. Luckily the terrain had a positive affect on the cyclist as well. The stones he found on the ground, helped keep his mind off the thirst. There were many factors of the setting that negatively and positively affected the cyclist throughout his adventure."
"The affected cyclist the setting a lot. One way was the heat. It got so hot that he was becoming dehydrated. He kept drinking his water, until he didnt have any left. Another reason is because the road turned into hills which made him use more energy. Finally, it didn't help that he hadnt seen any sign of living creatures except for a snake @CAPS1 how the setting affected the cyclist."
"are, dry, flat - all features Heat of the setting that effected the cyclist. As the cyclist was driving through the desert, he noticed how hot it was, and how he would become dehydrated quickley. I was also very dry and and he started to get nervous about how thirsty he was. The flat ground models how there is nothing around that can help the cyclist, which made him scared. The story also metions that he is a ghost town"

"In the story “Do not exceed posted speed limit” by Joe Kurmaskie were things many there that effected the cyclist. Such as the water. He had no really good water to drink because of where he was''. When I tryed a drop or two, it had the flavor of battery acid''. He wasnt able to drink the water because the battery acid'' that was in it could have made him very sick. Also the unstable roads that he had to bike through made things hard. ''Rough roads ahead'' To ride on unstable ground can be very hard to do. So just these two examples, the water and Rough roads made the features of the setting deffinitly effect the cyclist."

When I tryed a drop or two, it had the flavor of battery acid''. He wasnt able to drink the water because the battery acid'' that was in it could have made him very sick. Also the unstable roads that he had to bike through made things hard. ''Rough roads ahead'' To ride on unstable ground can be very hard to do. So just these two examples, the water and Rough roads made the features of the setting deffinitly effect the cyclist."
 The affected cyclist the setting because of the rode conditions. The rode was all messed up.
 The affects cyclist the setting in many ways. The setting affects the cyclist because the weather is very hot and humid which makes him sweat which is using up energy because his body is trying to stay cool. Also the setting affects the cyclist because there is no water so on top of sweating being out of energy he has no water to refuel his body which makes it very hard for him to keep going.
"The affects greatly cyclist the setting because he is the one riding over, “short rolling hills,” and arround a,“ridiculously large snake,” and because its hot he could suffer from heatstroke at any minut. So yes the author is affected by the setting"

"The give of the setting in Yosemite cyclist the features something in look forward to, but the feature of the sorting that he is in enduse in get there causes him despaire. As soon as the cyclist passes a ghost town and notices swettering hed of the sun during early endeavers of the trip he checks himself up as he says,""I brely noticed it [the sun], the cool pines and rushing hills of Yosemite had my name written all over them. Although the cyclist began to feel the toll that the trip and the sun was going to take on him, he erased the morning with the hope and bealy of arriving at Yosemite. The more the cyclist noticedthe sun the more he drank untill his water supply seemed low, striping as an old rusty water pump he had hope of being replenished but the taste of bitter battery acid caused the cyclist to stop drinking.

"The affect and features cyclist the setting because with each building he hopes for water, but since he is traveling through a desert water is in limited supply and many empty buildings are left out in the wastland. These buildings create a feeling of releve in the cyclist anty to be followed by despair to find them abandoned. The land with no features also creates a feeling of lost hope in the rider making his entire ordeal that much harder. Over all it was an excureiatly experience physicly and mentaly for the cyclists."

"Tsaw cyclist was so set on seeing cool, piney trees and lakes, that wsawn saw dirt he, snake, and no source of civilization worried him. More affectively, what he didn’t see scared him most. He did see windy rivers or trails hidden beneath all kinds of trees. He didn’t see any people or friendly little forest critters. Instead he just saw the same rusty color of dirt and the occasional snake. His mood was affected and he started to lose confidence and hope. He wasn't used to the new surroundings and for a while doubted if he could even make it out alive. When he came across the run-down building of Welch’s factory, he was even more distraught. Fortunately, he did find civilization when he came to a fishing supply shop. This definetly boosted his spirits. Once he had saved his thirst problem and assured himself he has alive and would luckily stay that way, he sat down before wading out again in search of his destination."

"The affect cyclists the settings for many reasons. One, if the setting is nice, the rider can concentrate on the scenery not on only pain they are having. also, if the setting isn’t very nice, the rider would probably concentrate more on the pain than they would the scenery. another thing is if the setting is very hilly & the rider has to drive over it, it @MONTH1 not feel the greatest. The cyclist would get even more pain than before plus the cyclist could could get dehydrated faster, the setting really does affect the cyclist."
 are features numerous There in the setting that effect the cycleist. For example  the rough road. A nother example is the tumble weed and the snake also affected the cyclist. In conclusion those are the reasons the setting affects the cyclist.
"The affect of the setting cyclist the features because it is hard to go far on a bike when the place, you are ridding is dry, abandoned, a quiet, hot cold and straight forward. It tells you that the setting is abandoned when if says “there was none in sight, not a building, car or structure of any kind"". This would make it hard for a cycler because you need a good water supply and thats hard to keep when there is nothing around."

 The choose to take cyclist an old abandoned route to @LOCATION1. The route had in some places no buildings at all to see making the cyclist loss hope of his need for water. Until the end there was no one on the route making him all alone. So if something happen who would know. During his adventure he ran out of water making him dehydrated that didn’t help. The setting of the story seems tragic to the cyclist.
"are ways many There that the setting affected the cyclist. One way is in the story when it says that it was very hot, he could become dehydrated and could possibly have a heat stroke, also the rodes were windy. This could be a problem because hes tired so he might not be able to go around the turns, he might just keep going straight and then get lost even more. That is all about how the features of the setting affect the cyclist in the story."

"The affects cyclist the setting in a large way. He has a hard time going on his journey. He began to lose hope, get tired, and began to think he was going to die. The settings played the biggest role. It was very hot with no people or buildings around him. He had very little water and no place to get anymore. He then encountered a large snake which made it worse because he was in fear with no one around to help him. If he would have followed his own directions instead of the old men he would not have had this problem. The setting around him really made his trip a hard one with no water, people, towns, or buildings around him."
"In the stories, don’t exceed posted speed limit, are settings some very descriptive there. In the stories these settings have a great effect on the cyclist. Through these our settings the effects change. Some good effects some harsh effects. The first setting that is described do you is, ""the cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite had my name written all over them."" This setting gives you a vivid picture of were the cyclist is heading. This setting also establishes a happy sort of mood. Let the pretty picture is about to change. Not so much further in to the cyclist ride he noticed a change of terrain,"" flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills."" @CAPS1 the cyclist is short on water, and is becoming very tyered. Seeing this just crushes his spirit. @CAPS1 riding hills hard, but ridding hills with our knowing of something good waiting for you on the other side of the hills. Both of these, very different settings gives off very different feeling. The first one makes you think he is going to have as easy enjoy able bike ride. But this all changes when he hit those horrible hills. Just the thought of having so ride over miles of hills, makes your legs hurt. Over all the features of the setting saposed an intense bike ride for the cyclist, followed by a reward by beautiful place."
"The is in thdesert short story “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” desert a hot, sunny setting, in which all towns have been abandoned, “The sun was beginning to beat down” (@NUM1) “ i arrived at the first town it fit the defination of a ghost town (@NUM1) trational.

"The affects of the setting cyclist the features because the worst the affects get the more he wants water. For example, in the essay it said at some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculous large snake blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me when I think of tumbleweeds I think of dryness because it is like dry grass and when I think of snakes I think of heat because that is the time for snakes to come out when ot gets hot. So the cyclist was thinking about dryness of his throat and the dryness of his sorrounding making him want water. Another feature is when he seen a sandblasted picture of a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth probably making the cyclist wishing he could have that cold refreshing drink."

 The affect of the setting cycleist the features in many diferent ways. For example it was June and he was in the @CAPS1 of California. It was very hot and the dehydrated him. Also he did no know where he was going so he had to rely on other people directions. Also he had to keep dehydrate. That what affected the cycleist.
"The affect’s of the setting cyclist the feature because, the feature is dehydrated and has to nde on a horrible conditions of a road, snakes and hills. All of these features act like obstacle courses, which makes it hard to do what he’s trying to do which is recieve water. Also, with the cyclist being hot and in need of water he at this point is delinous and most likely doesn’t know whats going on. In the story the authors main feature of the setting is the road. “Rough road ahead.”  This explains the cyclist having to go on a rough road, and doing that dehydrated is very dangerous these are some of the features of the setting that affect the cyclist."

"The affected of the setting on the way to Yosemite National Park, greatly cyclist the features. On the way to the park, the cyclist had encountered the heat of the desert in California. Besides the heat the cyclist had to overcome the rough terrain of the of the short, rolling hills. This made the cyclist tired and weary. Adding to his weakness, and the extreme heat, he also ran out of water, causing him to become dehydrated. “Wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from a heat stroke...laugh.” This trip through the California desert greatly affected the cyclist by causing great exhaustion and dehydration."
 Some features of the setting setting affected cyclist the that were signs affected had speed limits. The sign affected the speed of the cyclist. Another feature was a hill on the route. This affected the cyclist by making him tired because he said “I wipe the sweat from my eyes.”

"In the short story “Do Not Posted Limit Speed Exceed” by Joe Kurmaskie. the setting greatly affects the cyclist and his mindset. When the scenery is pretty and cheery, he is happy as well. This is shown when the author writes, “denyoved the serenity of an early- summer- evening.” This quote describes the scenery as a serre or peaceful place. His happiness is found in the first part of the quote when he said, “denyoyed” One does not enjoy something unless they are happy or in a cherry mindset. Therefore, the peaceful scery affected the cyclist by making him happy. the same can be said for merry scenery too. This is found when the author says, “At some point, tumble weeds crossed my path and the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke”. This quote, describes the scenery as a place that they tumbleweeds. Steryotypically, tumbleweeds are found in dreary and lonely place. This lonely scenery takes it if full on the cyclist. He becomes pessimist and is making of all that could go wrong, not all that could get better. This is found around us every day. The poor and homeless who live with a low standard of living are often said. They have to exist with the affected the cyclist. In conclusion, the seeing does affects the cyclist and his mindset drastically."
"The Do not exeed in “speed limit posted terrain” by Joe Kurmaskie the cyclist had to cope with many difficulties. He was already lacking water from the anduous journey and then the enviroment turned against him. The narration states, “I noticed the terrain changing flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.”(Kurmaskie @NUM1). This means the cyclist is going to put forth more energy to make it up these hills. Energy he barely has. This  will drain almost all the energy the cyclist has. Another example is, “At some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path”(Kurmaskie @NUM1). This means that the cyclist is in the middle of nowhere with barely any water and energy, causing even more problems. In conclusion, the setting in, “Do not exceed posted speed limit” by Joe Kurmaskie caused many problems for the cyclist."

"The affected of the setting cyclist the features in many ways. He was riding his bike across a place with no cars, no people, no water, or no food. It was a dangerous journey for him but he made it."
 The affect of the setting cyclist the feature about old timers giving him wrong information about taking this short cut he was going to take. Running out of water and energy and he was doubt himself and giving up on race It say he.
 Twas going feature of twas going setting affect twas going cyclist about old timers giving him wrong information about taking this short cut was going to take he. Running out of water and energy and he was doubt himself and giving up on race It say he.
"In the story “Do Not Posted Limit Speed Exceed” the features of the setting effect the cyclist. They effect the cyclist’s confidence, and hope. I say this because through out the story he sees things that would consern other people like the towns that are suppose to be the best end up “Ghost towns” and the road from flat to hills. Yet he continues on and then says “what I believed was my last burst of energy,” “I was going to die.” The cyclist dosent think he can continue but manages to keep going hoping that the next horizon to see a building or something. Hope saved his life because if he knew he could not continue that he could die."
"The affected of the setting cyclist the features in many ways. Like he was in a desert, no one to give him good information, no towns close by that are still running, it was a hot summer day, no water near by. These affected the cyclist because they made him not sweaty, dry mouth, no energy, and he was having alot of doubt that he was not going to make his journey alive. In the story they cyclist said, ''I picked up some pebble and put them in my mouth. With my luer. I'd hit a bump and lodge one in my throat. It didn’t really matter. I was going to die. ''When he said that he showed alot of doubt. Everytime he got to a town or bulding it was abandoned. He saw an abandoned  building witch was ironically a Welch's Grape Juice factory and bottling plant. That made him even more thirstier. Thats how the features affected the cyclist."
"The cyclcausets problem in Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit by ""@PERSON1"" cause dehydration and the is cause the California terrain. California is full of long deserts that can exceed @NUM1 degrees in sammer, and the cyclist was exerting himself so dehydration was inevitable. In the story the cyclist says “I could drop from a heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June” so the setting is obviously a hazard."
"The affect of setting cyclists the feature because if you are a guy and you ride a bike then you might have to where about falling of your bike, or out of water. I you keep at a fast past and don’t have any water then you can get dehydrated. In the essay it tells how he had ran out of water and he thout he was going to die he had gotten dehydrated but lukly he had find some were to get something to drink"

 The affect of setting cyclist the features in many ways. At first when he sees the tall pines and the river he is calm: and chilled out. But when he sees the abandoned “@PERSON1’s Grape Juice” factory he becomes desperate and thinks he is going to die out in the desert. A guy travels to @ORGANIZATION1 where he meets “old timers and the give him a “shortcut” to the park. He then goes on his bike to the park taking their “shortcut.” While traveling starts to run out of water and then he thinks he is going to die out in the desert. “It din’t really matter. I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean.” This quote means now that he is out in the desert he thinks he is going to die since he has no more water. This relates because he becomes desperate  for water because he is out in the desert in the midde of June.
"The can affect cyclist the features very well or not. I depends on what condition happening. For example, he could fall. Does he have a traveling first aid kit."
"The affected of the setting greatly cyclist the features. For example, the cyclist was in California, which is an extremely hot place in the desert in June. These features made dehydration a more keen possibility. Another example, is paragraph ten. It explains how the rough road, tumbleweeds, and large snake made it hard for the cyclist to keep his balance without water. Also, the essay describes a building with a poster of a small child drinking a refreshing glass of juice,this made the cyclist think more about water and  become very thirsty. Although thier was some possitive effects of the setting on the cyclist. The pebbles aloud him to keep his mouth moist and not think so much of his thirst. Also, the bait shopped allowed him to opt something to drink, and not die from dehydration."
 The harsh made in “DO Not Exceed Posted Speed limit “by Joe Kurmaskie @CAPS1 the setting for the cyclist more difficult due to the hot weather and the inconsistancy of the pavement. The very hot June day was a cause of the cyclist slowing down. “wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt and the growing realization that I could drop from heat stroke on a gorgeous day in June.” This proves that the cyclist is very hot due to the summer heat. Another factor of the cyclist slowing down is the inconsistant of the pavement on the road “Flat road was replaced by short rolling hills.” The @CAPS2 proves that the road could be slowing the cyclist also. It seems the cyclist has a lot against him. But if he keeps his head up he can make it to “Yosemite.”
"Several features of the setting affected cyclist the that were time of year, the desert land, the lack of civilization, the lack of resources – especially water, and the rugged characteristics of the land. The cyclist was traveling during the summer time, which was the hottest time of the year. He was also traveling through the deserts which create an even hotter climate. “I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June,” was a quote from the selection that tells us this. If he had been traveling in the @DATE2, for example, he @MONTH1 have been more comfortable. Throughout his trip, the author does not after come desert civilization. He runs into a deserted factory and miles of land without people. The fact that he is traveling through desert terrain also helps us realize that water is scarce. He has trouble finding a place to get water. This made the trip extra hard and discouraging. “I was going to die” he says. As he travels farther, the land also becomes harder to travel on. “Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills” this characteristic is a setting, like the others, negatively affects the cyclist by making his journey harder."

"Several were of the setting that affected the cyclist lack time of year, the desert land, the features of civilization, the features of resources – especially water, and the rugged characteristics of the land. The cyclist was traveling during the summer time, which was the hottest time of the year. He was also traveling through the deserts which create an even hotter climate. “I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June,” was a quote from the selection that tells us this.

"The affect of the settings cyclist the features in many ways when he starts of, he is bright and happy just as the slenecy is nice and calming. There is a pace that makes him feel like nothing wrong. “I rode into the morning with strong legs and a smile on my face.” After about @NUM1 miles on the cold, his life was getting low, and he came to his second abundant place. He then felt a little disturbed and worried. He needed to find a place with water. “This site was trebling.”  There he fins water plant not his hopes rise a bit, until he finds the water isn’t good. “A tarlike substance oozed out, followed by brickish water feeling some which is in the neighborhood of two hundred trees”. So he moves on and finally he re aches life! He is so relieved he can’t believe his luck.” Then as easily as rounding a body my troubles, thirst and fear were all behind me “The setting affects the mood in a very big way, the cyclist feels as the setting looks."
"The setting in “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not @CAPS1 Posted Speed Limit” state the cyclist's physical and mental Exceed. There are negative and positive effects for each state. The physical effects of the cyclist because of the settings all apparent throughout the story. For example, the cyclist reaches @PERSON2 and @PERSON1’s Fish Camp, he is able to hydrate once again. The positive effect makes the cyclist healthy and safe once again. The setting mentally, @CAPS1 the cyclist very substantitially. This can be seen when the cyclist in the comfortable camp around in @LOCATION1. He feels happy in this area. This positive effect prepares the cyclist to go on the trip to Yosemite. Also, when the cyclist reaches the “Ramshackle @CAPS2, several rusty pumps, and a corral, “he feels troubled. He is negatively affected mentally by the little amount of available water. In addition, the cyclist felt ""sad"" and ""hopeless” when cycling in the Dry, arid terrain. The cyclist is in the worst mental state in this place. Finally, the cyclist felt relieved upon seeing the fish camp. He describes the feeling by saying that his trouble are now “behind” him. Settings positive effect in this instance changes mental state from negative to positive. Setting was the main factor in deciding upon the cyclist’s physical and mental state. Setting @CAPS1 the cyclist’s physical and mental state in positive and mental states almost equally in the story."
"The effects of the essay, “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” cyclists the setting physical and emotional attitude. In the beginning of the essay the cyclist, “rode into the morning with strong legs and a smile on [his] face.” It was not too hot yet in the morning. So, the cyclist was happy and strong. He was confident he could conquer anything. As the day grew on “the sun was beginning to beat down” He was beginning to drink lots of water but he was still confident and strong. “I came to a ramshackle shed [and] several rusty pumps the sight was troubling. “The cyclist was travelling in the hot deserts of California. He was becoming tired and thirsty. He had to save as much water as possible. What started as a confident ride into the desert became a survival ride. Once the cyclist findswater he is relieved. He feels more confident and can ride to his destination. The weather and setting can affect us emotionally and physically just like in the essay, the cyclist became tired both physically and emotionally as the hot, sunny day went on."
"The hot, dry, and baron affect cyclist the setting greatly. Baron is a hot, dry and abanded place. The cyclist is trying to ride his bike to Yosemite national park. He decides to follow the directions of coaple old men, which was a mistake.”…Simply because I listened to some gentlemen who hadn’t been off their porch in decades,”(Kurmaskie). The hot and dry conditions made the cyclists hardest obstacle to be staying hydrated."
"The affect of the setting cyclist the features in many ways. Ranging from temperature, surroundings, and the availability of water. First of all, the cyclist felt tired and exhausted because of the temperature and terrain, For example, “I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.” I can imagine the cruelty of the heat beating down on him while riding down the roads. It would make me tired and exhausted also. Second of all, the surroundings as he rode affected him and made him have less confidence as he rode further. For example, “This place might have been a thriving little spetatore time say, before the last world war-last on that morning it fit the traditional definition of a ghost town.” It shows how the information he had been giving caused him to feel unsure of where he was going. I’d feel uncapable and would do the same in his situation. Lastly, the lack of water made him scared. For example, “conserve my water and go instead for an hour or so a lest of my inner spirit.” It made him think the situation wasn’t good. So as one can see, it affected the cyclist in many ways."
"In the essay “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” the uses features author of the setting to show the effects of the cyclist. In the essay the rider gets directions from two old men on a perch. In the essay it said, “Never accept braid advice from  a collection of old- timers who haven’t let be able centres of their porch since carter was in office. “This shows the old man could be wrong and places can change. Also, on this short cut he almost runs out of water. The essay ststed I would conserve my water and go inward for an hour or se – a test of my inner spirit. He is running out of water but has the determination to get to @CAPS1 last the terrain affects him. The Hills prove to be a challenge with a limited supply of water. The essay states. Flat roads were upleed by sheed, rolling hills. This shows he is extremely determined. Even though the hills added to the struggle he made it through. That is how the author used features of the setting to add to the struggle of the cyclist."

 The affected of the setting cyclist the features because they figured that they were old enough and seen what was going on and been through that situation that they were well experienced and knew more about what was going on so the people should listen to them.
"After the cyclist spoke to the “old timers had n’twho left the confines of their porches since Carter was in office,” his confidence in them began to ware. He entered the desert happy, hopeful and determined. As his water reservoir began to disappear, and he approached the sight of the old shed, canal and a couple water pump, he began to feel touched. He made an attempt to get the water from the pumps and it was hot and “tested like battery acid”. As he rode on, his confidence only faded more. He travelled through the desert and “ridiculously large snake” and was running low on water. Finally he saw a building in the distance, which ironically enlights was an abandoned juice factory a sign featuring a left sipping on some succulent icy liquid teased ruin, and he began to lose hope. He didn’t think he would make it to his destination or anywhere else for that matter. Although after approaching the old factory, he came across a bait shop where his hope and energy was founded."

"The affected in “Rough Road Ahead: Do not exceed posted speed limit,” cyclist the setting greatly. For starters it says he was “traveling through the high desserts” which is never a safe thing. He had been drinking he water regularly but the temperature was rising. He was, “trying to keep balance in my dehydrated state.” From lack of water because the terrain had altered his water into “A far like substance” The setting of the story was cruel to the cyclist."
 The affect of the setting cyclist the features in a couple different ways. When the cyclist found the gohst town since no one was there he could not ask someone for better directions or get some food or water. The short rolling hills make it harder to pedal because it is hard to pedal uphill. At the end of the story he found a bait shop where he got water and better direction's.
 The affect of the setting cyclist the features in many ways. The features of the setting that affect the cyclist is the lact of information on were to go and the lack of water. This was a problem because he needed water for his trip and directions on were to go.

"The essay â€œRough Road Ahead: Do Not describes Posted Speed Limitâ€ bicycle ride a manâ€™s Exceed through California. Now, California is very hot during the summer, which is when the cyclist is riding. This setting greatly affects the manâ€™s journey. It made it very difficult for him to finish his ride. He drank most of his water in the beginning of his ride so he gets very dehydrated. The text states, â€œThe water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips.â€ As you can see the setting makes this manâ€™s bikeride very hard."
"Some affect of the setting cyclist the features. First the cyclist followed the old codgers advice of how to get to Yosemite National Park. Their advice was no use and didnt help her in the end. Next, â€œa tarlike substance oozed outâ€ of what she thoot was going to be water. Then the terrain changed to â€œshort, rolling hillsâ€, which wasnt helping, her bike better. Lastly, ""tumble weeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snakeâ€, slowed her down. All of these road blocks in the setting affected the cyclist."
"The affect of this setting cyclist the features in many ways. The setting is a dessert so by common knowledge you know that it is going to be hot and dry. Because it is hot the cyclist needs more water because he is getting dehydrated. And when he is on his low of water because it is dry into mouth gets drys. @CAPS2 because he is in the dessert he sees wild sometime dangerous animals, in the story he sees a ridiculously @CAPS1 diamondbrock snake, which I believe are venomous, @CAPS2 â€˜because â€˜ of the extreme heat of the dessert he realizes that he had ??? chance of dropping from heatstroke. @CAPS2 the writer said that the dessert had short rolling hills and rough road ahead ??? would leave worn the cyclist out. Because of this terrain the cyclist way affects."
 The features of the settings affect in the story â€œDo Not posted Limit speed Exceedâ€ it is the morning and everyone is still sleep and he wakes in the morning for something to do when he pull up to the first plase he thinks that they are all old and crazy and he thinking that the places needs fixing because the houses are falling apart.

"In the story many different affected author the settings in many different ways. In the very beginning of his journey he came across a ghost town. He reacted to the features of this setting with humor and hope. â€œI chuckled, checked my water supply, and moved on."" He still has hope that he would end up safe and in the right place. The next setting was an abandoned shed with a water pump and a fork in the rode. He grew worried when he saw that no near town was still in sight. â€œThis sight was troublingâ€ when the features of the next setting caught his eye he was desperate and devastated. â€œAt some point, tumble weed crossed my path and a ridiculously large snakeâ€ He was on rough terrain in the middle of the desert with little water, when he reached the abandoned @CAPS1â€™s factory all his hope was lost and when he was planning his death. â€œI was going to die and the birds would pick me clean."" @CAPS2, when he reached the fish camp, he was relieved ""I had overwhelming urge to seek out Gary and Wilber, Kiss them and buy some bait.â€ He was overjoyed and overwhelmed because he had survived."
"are not place exactly the most inviting Ghost towns for a cyclis trunning low on water supply. In â€œRough road ahead: do not exceed speed limitâ€ the cyclist is affected in many ways by his surrounding settings. Starting off on a warm day with the sun bright start off as a good thing, while his mood is still fresh and happy expressions play on his face. But as he moves on he speaks of how â€œThe sun was beginning to beat downâ€ expressing his remorse of listening to the old men that led him on their â€œshortcut.â€ Along the road he comes to his first let-down, a ghost town with â€œone ramshackle shop, several rusty pumps and a corral that couldnâ€™t hold the lamest male.â€ @CAPS1 he tries to pump the water from the corral but gets a â€œbattery-acidâ€ flavor and is forced to continue onward with little left to drink. This affects his mood to pity for himself and anger at the men who put him into the predicament. By the end he is relieved though when he comes to GARY & @CAPS2 FISH CAMP, a place with a working sink full of cold water. He says he â€œhad an overwhelming urge to seek out @ORGANIZATION1, kiss them and buy some bait.â€ His thankfulness is expressed to men he doesnâ€™t even know but because they were the light at the end of his long, dark and very exhausting tunnel."
"The affect of setting cyclist the features. It was hard arrived at the first town for author. For example â€œRough Road Ahead: Do not Exceed Posted Speed Limit.â€ The road that author was ridding, it was rough. @CAPS1 example is â€œFlat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.â€ All the road was hills and rough. Than â€œThe water bottle contained only a few tontalizing sips.â€ @CAPS1 doesnâ€™t have that much water. That was really hard."
"The puts deal a great setting of stress on the cyclist. The biggest issue he faces is the weather. He is a cyclist â€œtraveling through the high deserts of @LOCATION1 in June.â€ He had been riding his bike all day and he was soon going to run out of water. Just when he thought he could drink more water, he drank â€œwater feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees.â€ The weather being so hot and humid, did not help the cyclist throughout his journey. Another factor of the setting that affected the cyclist was the terrain. â€œFlat road was replaced by short, rolling hills,â€ is a main problem the cyclist faced. These changes in terrain played into the fact that the weather did not cooperate. The hills made the cyclist work harder therefore use more energy. Luckily the terrain had a positive affect on the cyclist as well. The stones he found on the ground, helped keep his mind off the thirst. There were many factors of the setting that negatively and positively affected the cyclist throughout his adventure."
"The affected cyclist the setting a lot. One way was the heat. It got so hot that he was becoming dehydrated. He kept drinking his water, until he didnt have any left. Another reason is because the road turned into hills which made him use more energy. Finally, it didn't help that he hadnt seen any sign of living creatures except for a snake @CAPS1 how the setting affected the cyclist."
"are, dry, flat - all features Heat of the setting that effected the cyclist. As the cyclist was driving through the desert, he noticed how hot it was, and how he would become dehydrated quickley. I was also very dry and and he started to get nervous about how thirsty he was. The flat ground models how there is nothing around that can help the cyclist, which made him scared. The story also metions that he is a ghost town"

"In the story â€œDo not exceed posted speed limitâ€ by Joe Kurmaskie were things many there that effected the cyclist. Such as the water. He had no really good water to drink because of where he was''. When I tryed a drop or two, it had the flavor of battery acid''. He wasnt able to drink the water because the battery acid'' that was in it could have made him very sick. Also the unstable roads that he had to bike through made things hard. ''Rough roads ahead'' To ride on unstable ground can be very hard to do. So just these two examples, the water and Rough roads made the features of the setting deffinitly effect the cyclist."

 The affected cyclist the setting because of the rode conditions. The rode was all messed up.
 The affects cyclist the setting in many ways. The setting affects the cyclist because the weather is very hot and humid which makes him sweat which is using up energy because his body is trying to stay cool. Also the setting affects the cyclist because there is no water so on top of sweating being out of energy he has no water to refuel his body which makes it very hard for him to keep going.

"The give of the setting in Yosemite cyclist the features something in look forward to, but the feature of the sorting that he is in enduse in get there causes him despaire.

The more the cyclist noticedthe sun the more he drank untill his water supply seemed low, striping as an old rusty water pump he had hope of being replenished but the taste of bitter battery acid caused the cyclist to stop drinking. The rolling hills, Sun and tumbleweds did nothing to quech the cyclist thirst or at least divert his assertion. If the cyclists was to see a sign that said Yosemite @NUM1 miles away his spirits would have risen, instead he saw a sign that said, â€Rough Road Aheadâ€ which did nothing to help him.

"The affect and features cyclist the setting because with each building he hopes for water, but since he is traveling through a desert water is in limited supply and many empty buildings are left out in the wastland. These buildings create a feeling of releve in the cyclist anty to be followed by despair to find them abandoned. The land with no features also creates a feeling of lost hope in the rider making his entire ordeal that much harder. Over all it was an excureiatly experience physicly and mentaly for the cyclists."

"Tsaw cyclist was so set on seeing cool, piney trees and lakes, that wsawn saw dirt he, snake, and no source of civilization worried him. More affectively, what he didnâ€™t see scared him most. He did see windy rivers or trails hidden beneath all kinds of trees. He didnâ€™t see any people or friendly little forest critters. Instead he just saw the same rusty color of dirt and the occasional snake. His mood was affected and he started to lose confidence and hope. He wasn't used to the new surroundings and for a while doubted if he could even make it out alive. When he came across the run-down building of Welchâ€™s factory, he was even more distraught. Fortunately, he did find civilization when he came to a fishing supply shop. This definetly boosted his spirits. Once he had saved his thirst problem and assured himself he has alive and would luckily stay that way, he sat down before wading out again in search of his destination."

"The affect cyclists the settings for many reasons. One, if the setting is nice, the rider can concentrate on the scenery not on only pain they are having. also, if the setting isnâ€™t very nice, the rider would probably concentrate more on the pain than they would the scenery. another thing is if the setting is very hilly & the rider has to drive over it, it @MONTH1 not feel the greatest. The cyclist would get even more pain than before plus the cyclist could could get dehydrated faster, the setting really does affect the cyclist."
 are features numerous There in the setting that effect the cycleist. For example  the rough road. A nother example is the tumble weed and the snake also affected the cyclist. In conclusion those are the reasons the setting affects the cyclist.
"The affect of the setting cyclist the features because it is hard to go far on a bike when the place, you are ridding is dry, abandoned, a quiet, hot cold and straight forward.

 The choose to take cyclist an old abandoned route to @LOCATION1. The route had in some places no buildings at all to see making the cyclist loss hope of his need for water. Until the end there was no one on the route making him all alone. So if something happen who would know. During his adventure he ran out of water making him dehydrated that didnâ€™t help. The setting of the story seems tragic to the cyclist.
"are ways many There that the setting affected the cyclist. One way is in the story when it says that it was very hot, he could become dehydrated and could possibly have a heat stroke, also the rodes were windy. This could be a problem because hes tired so he might not be able to go around the turns, he might just keep going straight and then get lost even more. That is all about how the features of the setting affect the cyclist in the story."

"The affects cyclist the setting in a large way. He has a hard time going on his journey. He began to lose hope, get tired, and began to think he was going to die. The settings played the biggest role. It was very hot with no people or buildings around him. He had very little water and no place to get anymore. He then encountered a large snake which made it worse because he was in fear with no one around to help him. If he would have followed his own directions instead of the old men he would not have had this problem. The setting around him really made his trip a hard one with no water, people, towns, or buildings around him."
"In the stories, donâ€™t exceed posted speed limit, are settings some very descriptive there. In the stories these settings have a great effect on the cyclist. Through these our settings the effects change. Some good effects some harsh effects. The first setting that is described do you is, ""the cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite had my name written all over them."" This setting gives you a vivid picture of were the cyclist is heading. This setting also establishes a happy sort of mood. Let the pretty picture is about to change. Not so much further in to the cyclist ride he noticed a change of terrain,"" flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills."" @CAPS1 the cyclist is short on water, and is becoming very tyered. Seeing this just crushes his spirit. @CAPS1 riding hills hard, but ridding hills with our knowing of something good waiting for you on the other side of the hills. Both of these, very different settings gives off very different feeling. The first one makes you think he is going to have as easy enjoy able bike ride. But this all changes when he hit those horrible hills. Just the thought of having so ride over miles of hills, makes your legs hurt. Over all the features of the setting saposed an intense bike ride for the cyclist, followed by a reward by beautiful place."

"The affects of the setting cyclist the features because the worst the affects get the more he wants water. For example, in the essay it said at some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculous large snake blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me when I think of tumbleweeds I think of dryness because it is like dry grass and when I think of snakes I think of heat because that is the time for snakes to come out when ot gets hot. So the cyclist was thinking about dryness of his throat and the dryness of his sorrounding making him want water. Another feature is when he seen a sandblasted picture of a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth probably making the cyclist wishing he could have that cold refreshing drink."

 The affect of the setting cycleist the features in many diferent ways. For example it was June and he was in the @CAPS1 of California. It was very hot and the dehydrated him. Also he did no know where he was going so he had to rely on other people directions. Also he had to keep dehydrate. That what affected the cycleist.
"The affectâ€™s of the setting cyclist the feature because, the feature is dehydrated and has to nde on a horrible conditions of a road, snakes and hills. All of these features act like obstacle courses, which makes it hard to do what heâ€™s trying to do which is recieve water. Also, with the cyclist being hot and in need of water he at this point is delinous and most likely doesnâ€™t know whats going on. In the story the authors main feature of the setting is the road. â€œRough road ahead.â€  This explains the cyclist having to go on a rough road, and doing that dehydrated is very dangerous these are some of the features of the setting that affect the cyclist."

"The affected of the setting on the way to Yosemite National Park, greatly cyclist the features. On the way to the park, the cyclist had encountered the heat of the desert in California. Besides the heat the cyclist had to overcome the rough terrain of the of the short, rolling hills. This made the cyclist tired and weary. Adding to his weakness, and the extreme heat, he also ran out of water, causing him to become dehydrated. â€œWide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from a heat stroke...laugh.â€ This trip through the California desert greatly affected the cyclist by causing great exhaustion and dehydration."

"In the short story â€œDo Not Posted Limit Speed Exceedâ€ by Joe Kurmaskie. the setting greatly affects the cyclist and his mindset. When the scenery is pretty and cheery, he is happy as well. This is shown when the author writes, â€œdenyoved the serenity of an early- summer- evening.â€ This quote describes the scenery as a serre or peaceful place. His happiness is found in the first part of the quote when he said, â€œdenyoyedâ€ One does not enjoy something unless they are happy or in a cherry mindset. Therefore, the peaceful scery affected the cyclist by making him happy. the same can be said for merry scenery too. This is found when the author says, â€œAt some point, tumble weeds crossed my path and the growing realization that I could drop from heatstrokeâ€. This quote, describes the scenery as a place that they tumbleweeds. Steryotypically, tumbleweeds are found in dreary and lonely place. This lonely scenery takes it if full on the cyclist. He becomes pessimist and is making of all that could go wrong, not all that could get better. This is found around us every day. The poor and homeless who live with a low standard of living are often said. They have to exist with the affected the cyclist. In conclusion, the seeing does affects the cyclist and his mindset drastically."
"The Do not exeed in â€œspeed limit posted terrainâ€ by Joe Kurmaskie the cyclist had to cope with many difficulties. He was already lacking water from the anduous journey and then the enviroment turned against him. The narration states, â€œI noticed the terrain changing flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.â€(Kurmaskie @NUM1). This means the cyclist is going to put forth more energy to make it up these hills. Energy he barely has. This  will drain almost all the energy the cyclist has. Another example is, â€œAt some point, tumbleweeds crossed my pathâ€(Kurmaskie @NUM1). This means that the cyclist is in the middle of nowhere with barely any water and energy, causing even more problems. In conclusion, the setting in, â€œDo not exceed posted speed limitâ€ by Joe Kurmaskie caused many problems for the cyclist."

"The affected of the setting cyclist the features in many ways. He was riding his bike across a place with no cars, no people, no water, or no food. It was a dangerous journey for him but he made it."

 Twas going feature of twas going setting affect twas going cyclist about old timers giving him wrong information about taking this short cut was going to take he. Running out of water and energy and he was doubt himself and giving up on race It say he.
"In the story â€œDo Not Posted Limit Speed Exceedâ€ the features of the setting effect the cyclist. They effect the cyclistâ€™s confidence, and hope. I say this because through out the story he sees things that would consern other people like the towns that are suppose to be the best end up â€œGhost townsâ€ and the road from flat to hills. Yet he continues on and then says â€œwhat I believed was my last burst of energy,â€ â€œI was going to die.â€ The cyclist dosent think he can continue but manages to keep going hoping that the next horizon to see a building or something. Hope saved his life because if he knew he could not continue that he could die."
"The affected of the setting cyclist the features in many ways. Like he was in a desert, no one to give him good information, no towns close by that are still running, it was a hot summer day, no water near by. These affected the cyclist because they made him not sweaty, dry mouth, no energy, and he was having alot of doubt that he was not going to make his journey alive. In the story they cyclist said, ''I picked up some pebble and put them in my mouth. With my luer. I'd hit a bump and lodge one in my throat. It didnâ€™t really matter. I was going to die. ''When he said that he showed alot of doubt. Everytime he got to a town or bulding it was abandoned. He saw an abandoned  building witch was ironically a Welch's Grape Juice factory and bottling plant. That made him even more thirstier. Thats how the features affected the cyclist."
"The cyclcausets problem in Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit by ""@PERSON1"" cause dehydration and the is cause the California terrain. California is full of long deserts that can exceed @NUM1 degrees in sammer, and the cyclist was exerting himself so dehydration was inevitable. In the story the cyclist says â€œI could drop from a heatstroke on a gorgeous day in Juneâ€ so the setting is obviously a hazard."
"The affect of setting cyclists the feature because if you are a guy and you ride a bike then you might have to where about falling of your bike, or out of water. I you keep at a fast past and donâ€™t have any water then you can get dehydrated.

 The affect of setting cyclist the features in many ways. At first when he sees the tall pines and the river he is calm: and chilled out. But when he sees the abandoned â€œ@PERSON1â€™s Grape Juiceâ€ factory he becomes desperate and thinks he is going to die out in the desert. A guy travels to @ORGANIZATION1 where he meets â€œold timers and the give him a â€œshortcutâ€ to the park. He then goes on his bike to the park taking their â€œshortcut.â€ While traveling starts to run out of water and then he thinks he is going to die out in the desert. â€œIt dinâ€™t really matter. I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean.â€ This quote means now that he is out in the desert he thinks he is going to die since he has no more water. This relates because he becomes desperate  for water because he is out in the desert in the midde of June.
"The can affect cyclist the features very well or not. I depends on what condition happening. For example, he could fall. Does he have a traveling first aid kit."
"The affected of the setting greatly cyclist the features. For example, the cyclist was in California, which is an extremely hot place in the desert in June. These features made dehydration a more keen possibility. Another example, is paragraph ten. It explains how the rough road, tumbleweeds, and large snake made it hard for the cyclist to keep his balance without water. Also, the essay describes a building with a poster of a small child drinking a refreshing glass of juice,this made the cyclist think more about water and  become very thirsty. Although thier was some possitive effects of the setting on the cyclist. The pebbles aloud him to keep his mouth moist and not think so much of his thirst. Also, the bait shopped allowed him to opt something to drink, and not die from dehydration."
 The harsh made in â€œDO Not Exceed Posted Speed limit â€œby Joe Kurmaskie @CAPS1 the setting for the cyclist more difficult due to the hot weather and the inconsistancy of the pavement. The very hot June day was a cause of the cyclist slowing down. â€œwide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt and the growing realization that I could drop from heat stroke on a gorgeous day in June.â€ This proves that the cyclist is very hot due to the summer heat. Another factor of the cyclist slowing down is the inconsistant of the pavement on the road â€œFlat road was replaced by short rolling hills.â€ The @CAPS2 proves that the road could be slowing the cyclist also. It seems the cyclist has a lot against him. But if he keeps his head up he can make it to â€œYosemite.â€
"Several features of the setting affected cyclist the that were time of year, the desert land, the lack of civilization, the lack of resources â€“ especially water, and the rugged characteristics of the land.

"The affect of the settings cyclist the features in many ways when he starts of, he is bright and happy just as the slenecy is nice and calming. There is a pace that makes him feel like nothing wrong. â€œI rode into the morning with strong legs and a smile on my face.â€ After about @NUM1 miles on the cold, his life was getting low, and he came to his second abundant place.

"The setting in â€œRough Road Ahead: Do Not @CAPS1 Posted Speed Limitâ€ state the cyclist's physical and mental Exceed. There are negative and positive effects for each state. The physical effects of the cyclist because of the settings all apparent throughout the story. For example, the cyclist reaches @PERSON2 and @PERSON1â€™s Fish Camp, he is able to hydrate once again. The positive effect makes the cyclist healthy and safe once again. The setting mentally, @CAPS1 the cyclist very substantitially. This can be seen when the cyclist in the comfortable camp around in @LOCATION1. He feels happy in this area. This positive effect prepares the cyclist to go on the trip to Yosemite. Also, when the cyclist reaches the â€œRamshackle @CAPS2, several rusty pumps, and a corral, â€œhe feels troubled. He is negatively affected mentally by the little amount of available water. In addition, the cyclist felt ""sad"" and ""hopelessâ€ when cycling in the Dry, arid terrain. The cyclist is in the worst mental state in this place. Finally, the cyclist felt relieved upon seeing the fish camp. He describes the feeling by saying that his trouble are now â€œbehindâ€ him. Settings positive effect in this instance changes mental state from negative to positive. Setting was the main factor in deciding upon the cyclistâ€™s physical and mental state.

"The effects of the essay, â€œRough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limitâ€ cyclists the setting physical and emotional attitude. In the beginning of the essay the cyclist, â€œrode into the morning with strong legs and a smile on [his] face.â€ It was not too hot yet in the morning. So, the cyclist was happy and strong. He was confident he could conquer anything. As the day grew on â€œthe sun was beginning to beat downâ€ He was beginning to drink lots of water but he was still confident and strong. â€œI came to a ramshackle shed [and] several rusty pumps the sight was troubling. â€œThe cyclist was travelling in the hot deserts of California. He was becoming tired and thirsty. He had to save as much water as possible. What started as a confident ride into the desert became a survival ride. Once the cyclist findswater he is relieved. He feels more confident and can ride to his destination. The weather and setting can affect us emotionally and physically just like in the essay, the cyclist became tired both physically and emotionally as the hot, sunny day went on."
"The hot, dry, and baron affect cyclist the setting greatly. Baron is a hot, dry and abanded place. The cyclist is trying to ride his bike to Yosemite national park. He decides to follow the directions of coaple old men, which was a mistake.â€â€¦Simply because I listened to some gentlemen who hadnâ€™t been off their porch in decades,â€(Kurmaskie). The hot and dry conditions made the cyclists hardest obstacle to be staying hydrated."
"The affect of the setting cyclist the features in many ways. Ranging from temperature, surroundings, and the availability of water. First of all, the cyclist felt tired and exhausted because of the temperature and terrain, For example, â€œI was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.â€ I can imagine the cruelty of the heat beating down on him while riding down the roads. It would make me tired and exhausted also. Second of all, the surroundings as he rode affected him and made him have less confidence as he rode further. For example, â€œThis place might have been a thriving little spetatore time say, before the last world war-last on that morning it fit the traditional definition of a ghost town.â€ It shows how the information he had been giving caused him to feel unsure of where he was going. Iâ€™d feel uncapable and would do the same in his situation. Lastly, the lack of water made him scared. For example, â€œconserve my water and go instead for an hour or so a lest of my inner spirit.â€ It made him think the situation wasnâ€™t good. So as one can see, it affected the cyclist in many ways."
"In the essay â€œRough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limitâ€ the uses features author of the setting to show the effects of the cyclist. In the essay the rider gets directions from two old men on a perch. In the essay it said, â€œNever accept braid advice from  a collection of old- timers who havenâ€™t let be able centres of their porch since carter was in office. â€œThis shows the old man could be wrong and places can change. Also, on this short cut he almost runs out of water. The essay ststed I would conserve my water and go inward for an hour or se â€“ a test of my inner spirit. He is running out of water but has the determination to get to @CAPS1 last the terrain affects him. The Hills prove to be a challenge with a limited supply of water. The essay states. Flat roads were upleed by sheed, rolling hills. This shows he is extremely determined. Even though the hills added to the struggle he made it through.

"In the essay â€œRough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limitâ€ the uses to show features of the setting author the effects of the cyclist.

 The affected of the setting cyclist the features because they figured that they were old enough and seen what was going on and been through that situation that they were well experienced and knew more about what was going on so the people should listen to them.
"After the cyclist spoke to the â€œold timers had nâ€™twho left the confines of their porches since Carter was in office,â€ his confidence in them began to ware. He entered the desert happy, hopeful and determined. As his water reservoir began to disappear, and he approached the sight of the old shed, canal and a couple water pump, he began to feel touched. He made an attempt to get the water from the pumps and it was hot and â€œtested like battery acidâ€. As he rode on, his confidence only faded more. He travelled through the desert and â€œridiculously large snakeâ€ and was running low on water. Finally he saw a building in the distance, which ironically enlights was an abandoned juice factory a sign featuring a left sipping on some succulent icy liquid teased ruin, and he began to lose hope. He didnâ€™t think he would make it to his destination or anywhere else for that matter. Although after approaching the old factory, he came across a bait shop where his hope and energy was founded."

"The affected in â€œRough Road Ahead: Do not exceed posted speed limit,â€ cyclist the setting greatly. For starters it says he was â€œtraveling through the high dessertsâ€ which is never a safe thing. He had been drinking he water regularly but the temperature was rising. He was, â€œtrying to keep balance in my dehydrated state.â€ From lack of water because the terrain had altered his water into â€œA far like substanceâ€ The setting of the story was cruel to the cyclist."
 The affect of the setting cyclist the features in a couple different ways. When the cyclist found the gohst town since no one was there he could not ask someone for better directions or get some food or water. The short rolling hills make it harder to pedal because it is hard to pedal uphill. At the end of the story he found a bait shop where he got water and better direction's.
"@CAPS1   the  story  the  effected of  problem  often mood the condition of the cyclist . For  example when the sign said ,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Rough road ahead: Do not exceed  posted speed limit.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ @CAPS1  this time he saw a snake he was scared so he eased  past trying to keep balance while he was  dehydrated . The dry and hot climate began to become problem for the cyclist."
"In tcan complete story, tcan complete cyclist starts out with a lot of confidence that can complete ride tcan complete whole he. But after he left first town he had been riding and needed water, so he stoped at a fork in the road he had just to;to get water from a pump which tastes like battery acid. Then as he progressed further in his trip he came to a sign that said â€œRough Road Ahead: Do not exceed speed limitâ€(Joe Kurmaskie pg @NUM1) This part of his trip made it very challenging by making him face rough roads and mountains that he had to cross which sucked the water out of him. Then as  he came over the last mountain, he saw a sign for a gart store. So when he arrived he got some water and got directions for a man who had the best map. So you can see that going over an the mountains, sucks all the water out of the cyclist, so he was so relieved when he got the water at the end."
"The have of the setting affect a major features on the cyclist. It is a very hot day and he is in a desert in California with a limited water supply. It starts becoming very hot, and his water supply begins to decrease quickly. The old men who he says â€œhave not left their porch since @PERSON1 was in officeâ€ gave him very wrong directions to Yosemite and he ended up getting lost out in a hot California desert. He eventually came to a fishing store where he refreshed with alot o f water from the sink, and then was off again on his way to Yosemite."
"The affect of the setting cyclist the features for a few reasons. One reason is that it makes it easier to picture how the cyclist feels. Also it makes the cyclist seem a bit insane for doing what heâ€™s doing in weather that he could, â€œdrop from heatstroke.â€ @CAPS1 reason is that the weather is affecting the cyclist so bad that heâ€™s seeing a mirage of a â€œbuilding-abandoned years ealier.â€ The features of the setting affect the cyclist because the conditions seem impossible to make it in."
 IIn the essay the affect of the cycleist setting the features because the readers wouldnt have thought that he was in that bad of danger if he hadnt of been going through the desert. When the cyclist got to the grape factory he stated that he was almost dehydrated. And then when he got to the bait shop he drank from the faucet.
"The affect of setting author the features because it moves him dehydrated. The dessert sun look sweat out of him and he had no water to bring that would replace his electrolites . Also, once the author had got into the hills he had lost a lot of his energy so peddling up his was a lot of work. If I were the author I would also have gotten tired because you need water in your body to survive."
"A is bike rider a cyclist. They can be in groups of diffrent people or they can be a solo cyclist. Some cyclist go for a few miles riding there bikes some can go for more like @NUM1 miles, some go over hills, go trow water they do alot with what they do. They have alot of time on there hards to ride a bike that far."
"The affected of the setting grate deal the cyclist features. For example, it was not and hill goet dehydrated. He went down this rusty-bumpy road, which didnt help his dehygration And another example would be he found a plane was he could set a change and find the best way to get where he was going. That the features on the setting affection the cyclist."
 The affect of the setting cyclist the features. The reasons were the water and the hills. One reason was water because his water were cooled down offer he refilled it all the way up. My last reason is because of the rolling hills.
"The affect in the setting dramaticaly cyclist the features. Everything was fine until he ran out of water and reached the hills. Now if he was in callada he woudnâ€™t of dehydrated. But the hills were sure to play with his mind. The most import setting is the welchs grape juice factory. He would have had all of the grape juice he wanted, but it was abandoned. An ironic twist â€œas he calls it. And the last one is hte bait shop that sawes his life, where an old man offers him directions."
"The affect of the setting cyclist the features by helping him get water for his thirst. And getting back on the road to go where ever he is trying to go at. But the only thing is that he didnâ€™t never say anything about getting his bait for the fish. Also, cyclist was all so affected because he almost died from thirst and no road."

For example when the narration says, â€œAt some point, humble weeds crossed my pathâ€ (Kurmaskie @NUM1). The tone of the cyclists from the quote above shows despare creeping into his mind. Also, another good example is when the narration says, â€œ@CAPS1 hill, a building came into viewâ€ (Kurmaskie @NUM1). The cyclist sounds more hopfull than before.

"Rolling hills, open terran, hgh deserts-are features all of the setting that affect the cyclist. First, Rolling Hills could take energy out of the cyclist when having to travel for miles on end. The open terrain leads to the beating sun which also puts pressure on the cyclist. Lastly, high deserts would have an affect on the cyclist because he has to pedal for mles on end in rough dry terrain putting strain on him overall."

I would say that this has a big effect on the cyclist since he dehydrates alot and is threatened with heatstroke. Also he had to ride careful past a huge snake which could have hurt him. Personally I donâ€™t know what he was doing ride threw the dessert by himself, and thatâ€™s his problem."
"The affected cyclist the setting because since it was the California desert, and it was in June, it was very hot and dry. Which caused him to get very thirsty and drink all his water. After almost all his water was gone, he began to get very tired, and since it is the desert, there isnâ€™t any one around to help him if he dehydrates and blacks out, so he has to persevere and really push through the situation if he wants to survive. But he eventually finds a bait shop and he has a drink there so he is okay."

"The affected cyclist the setting greatly throughout his ride. â€œThe water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips and the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke (pG @NUM1 kurmaskie).â€ This quote is saying that because of the heat, the rough terrain and the length of his â€œshortcutâ€ his running out of water. Thatâ€™s when he realizes he could die from heatstroke because he listened to a bunch of old men."
 The affect of the setting cyclist the features in many ways. He is in the desert and has a low supply of water. Without water he tired very easily .On top of that he had to pedal a bicicle. So he was thirsty and tired prambeing in the desert. This is how the setting affected the cyclist.

He states â€œThe sun was beginning to beat down,â€ @CAPS1, the sun was a big factor on the affect on the cyclist. Also, the hills of the country roads. Going up and down hills take alot of work you have to use alot of energy. The cyclist says â€œ@CAPS2 were replaced by short, rolling hills.â€ @CAPS3, there were snakes in the road, which make the cyclist timid looking out for snakes so he would not get bit. Againg the cyclist states â€œdimond back-blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me.â€ @CAPS4, there was an old factory that gave the cyclist hope and then crushed his hopes. The factory even made him more thirsty. @CAPS1, there were many affects on the cyclist due to the setting."

Towards the beginning when he was enjoying his ride no said â€˜â€™ The cool pines and rushing rivers of  Yosemite had my name all over them,â€™â€™ As time goes on and he begins to realize nobody inhabits the path he is on he becomes continues and the terrain become rougher."
"The have of the setting impact a big features on the cyclist. One feature is the hot weather and area he is in. He says he is in the â€œhigh desserts of California in June.â€ @CAPS1 being hot in @CAPS2, it has cyclist is around deserts, causing more heat. â€œI could drop from a heatstroke,â€ he says. Being hot from the sun beating down on him took away the cyclistâ€™s energy he needs for riding his bike. Another feature that affected the cyclist was his lack of water. â€œTrying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state.â€ This affected the cyclist by making him tired. Being tired from no water, the cyclist had trouble going up hills on his bike. The last feature that affected the cyclist was all of the hills in his road. â€œFlat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.â€ These hills made it hard to go up on a bike, considering his lack of water, and the heat.

"The affected of the setting cyclist the features in many was. First, the â€œtownâ€ The cyclist first comes upon is described as a ghost town. Although the cyclist chuckles about it, this setting sets up the long journey the cyclist has a head of him. There were other features that would negatively affect the cyclist. For example, â€œâ€¦I noticed the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.â€ (pg @NUM1). Flat land is much easier for a cyclist to pedal on. The change from flat land to hills affected his stamena and will to keep going. He really had to push himself to trudge up and down each hill.

"In the essay, â€œDo Not Exceed Posted Speed Limitâ€ are features many there of the setting that greatly affect the cyclist. Many of these features affect him in a negative way. One such feature is the hills that are present in the essay. These probably exasperated the cyclist even more than he already was with the sun beating down on him. Another feature was the road sign that said â€œDo Not Exceed Posted Speed Limitâ€ â€œThe speed limit was @NUM1. I was doing a water-depleting @NUM2. Sometimes life can feel so cruel.â€ The author/cyclist probably felt like he would never make it.

Finally, the bait shop offered much relief to the cyclist. â€œI had an overwhelming urge to seek out Gary and Wilber, kiss them, and buy some bait.â€ All in all, the setting affected the cyclist in some pretty bad ways until the end."

There also arenâ€™t many places to cool off at. They also described the water and Lodi to be about @NUM1 degree in temperature. The cyclist was trying to get to Yosemite to get away from the heat and to have a cool, shady pine trees to sit under, and cool fresh water. This affects the cyclist because he gets dehydrated because of the horrid heat."
"The affected of the short cut cyclist the setting in many ways.

Also in the story is says, ""flat roads were replaced by short rolling hills."" This could of made the journey even harder for the cyclist because now he had a little more effort to get up the hills one more example is towards the end he says ""i began breaking my ride down into distances, i could see the horizon telling myself i could make it there."" By the cyclist saying this it seems like he has given up and he realizes that this journey is going to never end untill he dies. That is how the setting on the story affected the cyclist."
"affect of the features of the setting cyclist the Many. The cyclist is biking through deserts. â€œA rediculously large snakeâ€ this quote shows that only is weather and climate agasint him but also nature.â€ I could drop from heat strokeâ€ another great quote showing how hot it really is where the cyclist is.â€ There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind.â€ A great detailed desciption of where the cyclist is and how deserted the area is.â€ The bottle only contained a few  tantilising sips.â€ This cyclist is low on water in the desert and in the desert with no water that could be a very bad thing. The above quotes really draw you in and you get to see the many features of the setting and what its like for the cyclist."
"Many affected in the setting of the essay ""Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limitâ€ cyclist the things throughout his journey. One very important part that affected the cyclist greatly is the fact that he was in a deserts without a good supply of water. Another part of the setting that challenged the cyclist was the length of his journey. Those two factors of his journey to Yosemite combined are probably the worst and most challenging things that affected the cyclist."
"The affect from the essay cyclist the features in many was because he is getting field, and is drinking more and more water. The raods are getting rough so he needs to slow down.

"Knew what should have brought was getting himself into so if should have brought needed water or nething like that, it was probly his own falt should have brought some he with him."
 The story is basically talking about more people wwanth cars should ride bicycles to work or to schoolâ€™s so want be it alot of polution in the air.
 The affects setting the features of the cyclist because in some ways they through you off a little with others lines and then will get confused of what their acually talking about. The littlest thing that could through you off is the line when it says before the last world war. That kind off through me off alittle.
"Tmeets features of tmeets setting make him happy because meets people some he that tell him of a route that will take a lot of time off his trip.

"The has in the story â€œRough Road Aheadâ€ by Joe Kurmaskie mind a very analyzing rider, which is affected by things around him. At first, the rider â€œrode into the morning...with a smileâ€ because of the bright sun, and the â€œcool pinesâ€ and rushing riversâ€...he is very confident with the old mens directions, this first sign of disapointment is when he comes to the â€œramshackle shed...â€ And the â€œ...sight of this was troubling...â€ to him, but he rode on. He thinks as he rides over the â€œcrippling hillsâ€ that maybe this wasnâ€™t such a great idea. Finally he comes to a old bait shop, and the â€œmodern bathroomâ€ that he enters to drink from, gives him relief from the desert he had just been riding through."
"At first the was going easy trip and flat. It was a nice day out and the water sapply was draining. Soon, the path became hills and soon got rough. Even though the pines gave shade it wasnâ€™t enough to help the cyclist. Eventually he reached some what civilization after enduring a grueling climb and by cycle trip through the woods."

"The affect of the setting cyclist the features in many ways.For example, ""I noticed the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills."" This quote shows that his surroundings were giving him diffuculty and a challenge for his travel. By describing the hills as ""rolling"" it helps the reader imagine the obstacles he was going through. Also, the sign that read, ""Rough Road Ahead; Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit."" gives the reader a feeling that the character is in danger. Lastly an example of the setting that helps shows the charcters hardships is, ""no one in sight, not a building, car or structure of any hand."" If anything were to the happen to the character, as the author was foreshadowing, he'd be stranded and all alone to die. He'd be in trouble and there would be no one to help him. If the author did not use these examples, the reader would not easily get a picture of the troubles he had to overcome. In conclusion these examples added emphasise and meaning to the text."
 At first took was mad because took advise he from old men who never left ttookir porch. He got scared he was going to die because had he drunk all his water and he didnâ€™t know how long it would be till he got some more. He shouldnâ€™t have drank his water so quickly knowing he had a while to go. Then he became happy when he saw the bait sign. He biked quickly down the hill.

When the cyclist first sees the speed limit sign of 55 mph, he says, â€œSometimes life can be so cruelâ€. Because he can only go 12 mph considering he's on a bike. After seeing the sign, a snake crosses his path. Heâ€™s frightened by it because it looked like a diamond back and he was trying to keep his balance and ease past it. Since the main problem the cyclist is faced with is the lack of water, the dry, long hills seem to make him more weak and tired. Tumble weeds crossed past him and there was no water in sight That is how the features of the setting affect the cyclist."
"The affected of the setting cyclist the features greatly. It made him become dehydrated.

 plays role a big Setting in this story. Without being in the desert in the hot @DATE1 there would not be a confict. There would be no importance in saving the water so he would not dehiderate. And the long flat roads are a symbol that the journey has still got a far way to go but as straight roads turn into hills it shows that there is a change in the journey and something better is about to happen.
"The affect in the setting of the essay author the features in one major way, dehydration. There are several features that causes the author to dehydrate. First off, he is riding throught a desert located in california. This means that there is bent from the sun constintly beating down on him. Also the change from â€œFlat readâ€, (Kurmaskie) to â€œshort, rolling hillsâ€ (@CAPS1) also affected him, getting dehydrated. This change cased him to use more energy to climb up the hills which means he used more water because he got thrister faster.

"The plays in the story ""Rough road aheadâ€ role a great setting on the characters journey. Some features that are mentioned in the story are heat, rough road, long crippling hills and a abandoned Grape Juice Factory. The heat in the story drives the cyclist into a dying thirst. @CAPS1 does her best to conserve her water through out the trip but the dry dessert heat doesnâ€™t allow it. Then comes the rough road ahead. The cyclist trys to keep a steady and secure pass as @CAPS1 peddels along the bumps and breaks in the road. The long crippling hills are next in line the cyclist has to use all her energy to work up the hill. @CAPS1 wipes the sweat from her eyes to make sure its not a mirage and then @CAPS1 seeâ€™s it the abandoned factory. This is where the cyclist loses all hope for if @CAPS1 doesnâ€™t receive water soon @CAPS1 is sure to be eaten by the birds. â€œThen, and easily as rounding a band, my troubles, thirst, and fear were all behind me. Gary and Wilber Fish Camp.â€ @CAPS1 rushed to the bathroom to drink the refreshing water to the sink pride and accomplishment overwhelm her."

"When the cyclist is in the â€œserenity of an early sunset eveningâ€, the enjoyed cycling his man just hoping he could cut his time in half. Then, once he got the advice and headed down the road he saw a ghost town which is never good. Next he came to the fork and the town he came to had no water. On the way to the new town he came to the bumpy road and going @NUM1 he was out of water but finally after his determination he made it to a place that was very nice. So as you can tell the features of the scenery road affected him greatly."

 is of the biggest setting in thhills story hills the desert and rolling Two. This would effect the rider becaus of the dehydration that he would experience. Being in the desert would make it obviously hot so you sweat alot and the hills would make it tough on your body because you put extrat strain to get up them. So all together this would be a hard bike ride.
"affected of the setting cyclist the Certin features. In the essay by Joe Kurmaskie, he desribes heâ€™s experiences when he cycled through the desert. ''...arrived at the first town''...it fit the traditional difinition of a ghost town. ''at first the cyclist was amused at this town and maybe a little scketle at it because the old â€œcodgersâ€  told it to be thriving. Halfway through his journey the stated ''sometimes life can be so cruel.â€ Water was running low and he still had a ways to go untill he made it to the park and he felt as If it would never end. All that he sees aroun him as hills of nothingness under the sorching son with his limited amount of water. No buildings are around the cyclist. The ghost town and the lack of shade or soluation are very features of the setting that make that cyclist feel like a fool for taking advice from older men."
"The conditions affected the bicyclist faced affected trip his that were various amount of things affected could really screw your ride up.

 The affect of the setting cyclist the features. The winding road could affect his turns because he could turn to far one way and fall off his bike and get hurt real bad. Another feature that could affect the cyclist is grass on both sides of the road.

"The takes of this story place setting with a man biking and then taking advice from old timers to a faster route. The biker knew from the start that he should have not given his map. But thinking the old folks knew the route he took theyre advice. What the biker should have done was look for someone to ask and make sure the route would work. But jumping to where he wanted to go led him to dehydration and much more struggle than needed. You should always think things out before you take action, just to be safe."

"learns dangers the Author Joe Kurmaskie of a lifeless wilderness during his experience described in â€œdo not exceed posted speed limit.â€ As a cyclist riding in one of the most undeveloped areas in California, the lack of water found in this setting proves crippling to his survival. The trails he was directed to had no towns or sources of fresh, drinkable water for days. The combination of constant exercise riding through the terrain, lack of water and recources, California summer weather and lack of civilization trained the authorâ€™s energy and caused him to suffer from dehydration. Too much exposer to these conditions could have killed him. The modern time period and year also caused the directions the author were given to be in accurate, and, thus, causing the cyclist to find him self in such a dangerous area of the country. The setting of â€œdo not exceed posted speed limitâ€ places the cyclist in a life threatening situation."
"The affect of the setting cyclist the features in, â€œRough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,â€ because it goes to many different terrains. The cyclist starts at a town and his working his way to Yosemite when he decides to listen to a group of old men. He started out strong until he got to the first town, which was totally abandoned. He kept going to another abandoned town. He decided to keep going until he saw a sign. The terrain was a lot diffrent with rolling hills and tumbleweed rolling by and a snake. Through listening to the old men the cyclist almost died from the threatening heat and lack of water. The setting affected the cyclist even more seriously than he could have imagined."

This quote â€œabout forty miles in the pedal I arrived as my first â€œtownâ€. The place might have been a thriving little syos as one timeâ€. This quote shows how deserted the desert is and how as he rides there is nobody around no where to re-hydrate no where to get drecionsn he was alone."
"When the began journey his cyclist he was confident in succeeding. Throughout the story however, the cyclist endures many conflicts to his successs in his journey. The cyclist faced his first difificulty once he reached a small, abandoned town. â€œI had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly, and I was traveling through the high deserts of California in Juneâ€ (kurmaskie @NUM1). The cyclist realized he had not conserved his water and his â€œwater bottles contained only a few tantalizing sipsâ€ (kurmaskie @NUM1). On top of his water problem the heat was unbelievable. He was losing hydration from all the sweat, and he was losing it quickly. The cyclist was also dealing with the difficult roads. There were many things this cyclist endured through-out his journey, but he was determined to finish his trip and was filled with satisfaction once he overcame these hardships."
"The has in the essay ""Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit"" effect a major setting on the cyclist. The setting is the high deserts of California"" where it is June and very hot. The path of the cyclist suggested by some old men makes the heat even worse because there are no people or water in sight. In the essay, the cyclist starts out the day confident and excited for his ride to Yosemite National Park. His mood changes throughout the day as after @NUM1 miles he arrives in a ""ghost town"" the old men led him to believe would be a settled town where he could get more supplies and cool off. Soon as the temperature rises to what feels like ""two hundred degrees"" the cyclist begins to run low on water and feels ""sometimes life can feel so cruel."" The heat and lack of people and water lead the cyclist to desperation and make him feel like as he says ""i was going todie."" The setting of the cyclists journey provides the mood of hopelessness and amplifies the feeling of determination felt by the cyclist to keep going at all costs because he was going to die if he stopped. The author, @PERSON1 uses the setting of the essay to help bring across his mesage that by blindly trustting people instead of trusting yourself things could end up being hard for you to overcome.."
"In the story â€œDo not Exceed Posted Speed limitâ€ the sees settings many different cyclist when he left it was early summer and it was pretty hot outside. He rode into the morning when would make him tired. The first town he reaches upon was a ghost town so that means he could rest get his supplies.

Then he showed up at a ramshack shed with several rusty pumps and a carrol that couldnâ€™t hold in the lamest made. Gated men which people made him feel uncocleible, and the pumps did not give him water so that was nobody also pointing. Then he was rideing through the California deserts in June witch probably made him more dehirrated."
"The should have never taken advice the cyclist from the older men. The map would have been a lot safer and easier. People seem to always look for a shortcut, including myself. He could have died from heat stroke and lack of water. He did have perseverance though he never gave up and that is what saved him. Being in that situation and setting I would have given up."
"In the story, the faced sites several meloncholy rider. For examples the â€œghost townâ€ that he ran into at first really put a load on him because he had no one to ask for futher directions or somewhere to freshen up. Futher on down the road the hill he came up on was a physical obsticle that he had to go over. With the sun beating on his back and the emptiness of the road he might have begin to want to turn back. He kept on persaveering which was how he made it down. The lack of water also mad it difficult for him. Traveling with his water running out and beginning to feel sick did not go well with him."

In this story the author fights dehydration as he tries to make to a national park with shortcut directions from â€œold timersâ€ the setting of this storygreatly affects the cyclist and the pitty the reader feels for him. Half way through the essay, the biker had already traveled roughly @NUM1 miles; thatâ€™s extremely crazy. The fact that he is travelling through California deserts in June is even harder to believe. The first time he mentions the setting, he states he is in a ghost town, two sentences after he states that the sun was beating down. At that point he wasnâ€™t really bothered. Another description of his setting that probably affected his ability to peddle was when he states â€œflat road was replaced by short rolling hills.â€ He was already dehydrated and had already traveled so far, the rocky roads probably didnâ€™t help his journey much. The setting basically made the story. If he wouldnâ€™t have been peddling in the desert, it would have just been another trip in his life. The setting makes the reader see what cyclist really go through."
"Due to the features in the setting, including the hot summer weather, the not knowing area the cyclist, and the California desert the not knowing is affected. In the short story â€œDo not exceed posted speed limitâ€ by Joe Kurmaskie the cyclist is travelling through the hot desert in June when he realizes hes running out of water, â€œI had been hitting my water bottles pretty reguarly and I was travelling through the high deserts of California in Juneâ€(Kurmaskie). This is affecting the cyclist because hes becoming hot and has a low supply of water. Also the cyclist realizes he should have never taken the direction from the old men and thinks to himself, â€œâ€¦The growing realization that I could drop from heat stroke on a gorgeous day in Juneâ€(Kurmaskie). This quote proves that the heat of the desert is taking a toll on him."
"In the essay, â€œDo Not Exceed Posted Speed Limitâ€ by Joe Kurmaskie, the affects him setting negatively because he was on his bicycle and he was in a hot area and no water whatsoever, like  in this quote, â€œI  got down on my hands and knees, working the handle of the rusted water pump with all my strength. A tar like substance ozzed out.â€ In the quote, the cyclist finally thinks he has found a water pump but he really gets nothing. Also, another negative thing is that he thought he was never going  to get to where he was going, but in the end , he got there and he got some water."
"In twas essay, â€œDo Not Exceed Posted Speed Limitâ€ by Joe Kurmaskie, twas setting affects him negatively because was water on his bicycle and was water in a hot area and no he whatsoever, like  in this quote, â€œI  got down on my hands and knees, working twas handle of twas rusted he pump with all my strength. A tar like substance ozzed out.â€ In the quote, the cyclist finally thinks he has found a water pump but he really gets nothing. Also, another negative thing is that he thought he was never going  to get to where he was going, but in the end , he got there and he got some water."
"The affect of the setting cyclist the features in a major way. For one, if the desert was not a deserted mountainous area, in California then the cyclist would not have the same problems. By changing anyone features of the setting you would change how the cyclist would behave in the setting. Thus changing the entire plot of the story. If the cyclist was say in the entry or a mere develop area then he would not face the same dangers as if he were in a mountainous region. The settings features have a huge affect on the cyclist."
"The affect cyclist the features in many ways. For example the road, the rocks everything close. The cyclist needs to know everything about where he's going, because if not then he can run into some problems along the way, For example like snakes, rough terrain, rocks in the way. That why its important for a cyclist to never listen to anyone but themselves. That why when you see cyclist you see them around, a road where theres cars around, just in case they get into trouble."
"The affected of the setting cyclist the features in several ways. The first was the terrain, which started out flat, then turned to hills. The cyclist was growing tired from all the pedaling. â€œFlat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.â€ This tired him out faster, since going uphill is harder than riding flat terrain. The heat definitely affected him, because it made him thirsty. He was â€œtravelling through the high deserts of California in June.â€ This is a very hot time of year, and when a person get lost without conserving water, which he had not done, a person get extremely thirsty. Not to mention the â€œsandblasted picture of a young boy pourng a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth,â€ which would remind the body of its thirst. So the setting most definitely affected the cyclist"
"Heat, abandoned roads, are all reasons snakes that affected the cyclist. The heat made him get dehydrated faster while he was using energy. The long abandoned roads further increased his doubt of living the whole bike ride. He used up allof his water. So when he got to the old pump hot dirty water came out. The snake in the story made the journey for this guy perilous and deadly. This all happened because he listened to the old guys. When the other old guy was about to tell him whereto go he said no."

 The affected cyclist the setting in many ways. For example he was riding in the desert and all the towns he was going to were abandoned. The month was June a hot month and the sun was beating down on him. And he was cycling with very little water.
"The authorâ€™s described terrain a difficult setting and harsh weather for bike riding. The author said that it was early summer which means it could be hot and uncomfortable weather for the cyclist. The author also that when the cyclist reached the first town, the sun began to heat down. That means the temperature is going to rise since the sun is getting stronger. Riding a bike in hot weather is very difficult because it takes a lot of effort and makes your body dehydrate faster because the heat makes you sweat which lowers your water retention. Another feature of the setting that the author described was the cyclistâ€™s location. He was traveling through the high deserts of California. This gives you a sense of how much hotter it is since heâ€™s traveling through deserts during early summer while the sun is high. After the first couple town, he starts to ride on short, rolling hills. Hills take a bigger toll on a personâ€™s body because it takes more effort to pedal up a hill."

 The setting of where takes journey effects there cyclsit the cyclist. The reason I say that is because in the story â€œDo Not Exceed Posted Speed Limitâ€ the cyclsit came upon a conflict with the setting. The conflict waas it was very hot and he did not use little things to survive witch he did. These are the reason why I say the setting of where cyclsit takes their journey matters.
"In the essay, sees ahead"" the character settings many â€œRough Road through his ride, all of which affect his mood and physical condition. For example, when the author describes one place he came to as, â€œone ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps and a corral that couldnâ€™t hold in the lamest mute greeted me. Thes sight was troublingâ€, this was the turning point where the cyclist began to worry. He was running out of water, â€œThe sun was beginning to beat downâ€, and he was probably tired of pedaling. But, to make matters worse, he came to rolling hills. This affected him because he had to work harder and had less water to pick him up. When he finally got to a â€œmodernizedâ€ town his spirits were lifted, and he was able to get water to cool him down. This gave him more strength and will-power to continue his trip Yosemite park."

"The Do in â€œNot @CAPS1 setting Posted speed limitsâ€ affects the mood of the cyclist in that every time the Do changes the mood of the cyclist changes. In the begining of the story the cyclist is riding through the â€œcool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite.â€ @CAPS2 this time the cyclist is enjoying his trip and is in a positive mood. As the story goes on â€œthere was no one in sight, not a building, a car, or structure of any land.â€ At this point in the story the cyclist has exchanged his positive mood for a desperate one as his water begins to run out."

"The drain of the setting only willpower the cyclist's features. The things he sees discourage him, for example one ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps and a corral that couldnâ€™t hold the larnest, mule greeted me. This sight was troubling .â€ The desolation begins to wear away his hope of finding a building or town sometimes the things are psychologically damaging,â€ In an ironic twist that should please all sadists reading this, the building abandoned years earlier, by the looks of it â€“ had been a Welchâ€™s Grape Juice factory and bottling plant. A sand blasted picture of a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth could still be seen.â€ For someone who is quickly running out of water, this this irony could make one lose their resolve to continue. The snake and rolling hills slow him down, and make him use more energy. The heat dehydrates the cyclist even faster. The environment is a hostile one for a cyclist."
"In this paragraph I will explain how the affect of the setting cyclist the features. The setting affect the cyclist in ways such as weather, road structure, & animals. All things that the cyclist could not controll. Therefor affecting the cyclist while he rides through."
"The affect of the setting cyclist the features because if is very hot and is summertime. The cyclist wouldnâ€™t have gotten so tired and exhausted if he wasnâ€™t in a â€œghost townâ€, with the, â€œsun beggining to beat downâ€. It was in @CAPS1 for nia during June so it was. Very hot, the water was also @NUM1 degrees! The text as states there were rolling hills and tumble weeds, so it must have been a desert kind of area. The trip was also a very long one, â€œabout forty miles into the petalâ€, causing him to be tired. As you can see the setting was an area with no people, and it was very hot."
 The would affect in the setting cyclist the features because they would want to have towns with water so they can restock theyâ€™re water. They would want water even more after going up hills. They would also want a palce to gey something to eat and maybe rest.

 The affects of the setting cyclist the feature because of the heat and had know water. Also how rough the road ahead was. Another problem was the dry air and snakes laying out everywhere in the desert. Also the hills were a big problem to because of the heat and know water. Finally the other problem was he knew he was going to die and the birds would eat at him and their would be nothing left of him. This is how the setting affected the cyclist.
"The effect cyclist the settings by the roughness of the ride. First, they go over a bunch of rocks, and the tire could poys. Next it could be smooth and easy. Also, it could be far away from towns and difficult to get back. There could be a lack of water making you dehydrate. That is how the setting around the cyclist could effect him."
"The setting desented in the story, â€œwould be Ahead: Do Not Exceed Speed Limit,â€ nightmare a Rough Road for any biker. This biker is riding in the middle of a desert on a summerâ€™s day. The sweat dropping down him is just speeding up his dehydration. This is shown when the narration states, â€œwide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that i could drop from heatstrokeâ€ (Kurmaskie). This show how hot the desert was, and how he could drop dead. The desert is also deserted with rolling tumbleweeds and giant snakes, as he passed abandoned towns and factories. The dangerousness for a biker in this area is very high. The biker was lucky to have made it out of those sorroundings alive."
"The affect of the setting  cyclist the features in many ways. The setting was a dry California desert, for if it had been a busting city, the events in the story would have not happened. The author asked a group of old men for directions to Yosemite National Park, and , â€œlike a foolish yuuth,â€ folluwed their advice. Everything started out fine until he reached the second town. He â€“ans almost dehydrated and â€œin an ironic twistâ€ he reached on abandoned grape juice foctary. Almost all hope was lost for him until he rounded the bend and came across his new hope: â€œGary and Wilberâ€™s Fish camp-if you wont bait pur the big ones, weâ€™re your best bet â€œ in He end he learned tostick to a map instead of old people who â€œhavenâ€™t left the confines of their purchess,hce carter was ,h officeâ€"
"In the setting are cars no there and no buildings meaning no help. The cyclist is tired and dehydrated because he ran out of water. No one was around because it was the desert. The cyclist was dehydrated but kept going to his destination. The road was straight but almost to the end there were many hills. Along with having to bike up the hills he almost ran into a snake. The weather was hot he had no water, he could have died."

"The is of thdesert story desert a dry, hot setting in the middle of June. These features of the setting, effect the author, because it shows how he starts of strong + determained and his left weak + doubtful. In the begining of the story, the author says, â€œThings began well enough. I rode into the morning with strong legs and a smile on my face.â€ This is showing the readers confidence he has with himself before starting his trip. Later on in the story, he discribes the setting as â€œthe high deserts of California in June.â€ He is discribing the heat + what he is facing. It goes on to tell how he is dehydrated in worn out. But he comes to a town, ""cool water drippen from my head as I slumped against the wall."" @CAPS1 he is relieved. As the setting changes, the authors attitude changes as well."
"The affect of the setting â€™s mood the cyclistfeatures throughout the essay. Joe @CAPS1 starts with being happy and confident to determined yet help helpless and then to relief. Joe writes, â€œThings began well enoughâ€¦ flat roadsâ€¦â€ This quote suggests that in the beginning, everything was okay. He started out with a â€œsmile on the face.â€ (@NUM1) @CAPS2, things start to change @CAPS1 hits changing terrain. He writes, â€œâ€¦I noticed the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short rolling hills.â€ This quote states the changing terrain. He starts to lose water to keep him going, yet he pushes himself to the next â€œtownâ€. Finally, when the author reaches â€œGary & Wilberâ€™s fish campâ€ he is relived when he sees an old guy sitting. The two men say, â€œknow The best way to get There? â€œYes sir! I own a very good map.â€ This reveals that Joe didn t ask for more directions which was his first mistake. In addition, changes in setting can chang a persons mood and attitude."
"The cyclistâ€™s affected around features him features negatively. He was cycling through â€œthe high deserts of California in Juneâ€ (Kurmaskie @NUM1). His water bottle was slowly running outand the only town he came to that had water had water that tasted like batteryacid. Events seemed pretty bad, until the speaker became elated when they saw a @ORGANIZATION1 factory. The author was thirsty and the side of the building had â€œA sandblasted picture of a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice into his mouthâ€ (Kurmaskie @NUM1). The building was abandoned. The speaker then states â€œSomehow  I climbed away from the abandoned factory of juices and dreams, slowly gaining elevation while losing hopeâ€ (Kurmaskie @NUM3). He lost hope after that landscape, and he pretty much gave up. The landscape or features affected the author very negatively due to the lack of water."
"In the essay â€œDo Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,â€ the affects of the setting cyclist the features in many ways. One thing is the water. There is little water and it is boiling hot. He took some taste of it. He said â€œIt tasted like battery acide.â€ To me if the water is hot donâ€™t taste it. Another thing is the land. The land went from straight to hilly. That started slowing him down. Last, is the day time. It started turning dark and he was still biking. He wanted to get as far as he could."
 Some features of the setting affect cyclist the that is he is riding a bike through the dessert. He says â€œI was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.â€ So he was scortching hot peddling a bike. The road became bumpy and curry. A sign had said â€œRough Road Ahead: Do not exceed posted Speed limit. The speed limit was @NUM1 and he was going @NUM2 so it must have been hard to get over all the bumps. The lastly he comes across and poisioness snake blocked the majority of the pavement infront of me.â€ So him dehydrated trying to get ground a snake would be terrifying. So on his @CAPS1 the setting doesnâ€™t help him much.

This could impact someone greatly who has never biked on different levals before. Lastly, the feeling of hoped could have effected him the most. Not believing in yourself is the hardest thing to overcome. Having just liesurly taken instructions by an old man cost the cyclist hours of torture. The author did a great job using hyperbole to exagerate the cyclists feeling of lost hope . He also used very detailed text to paint the reader a picture. These literay elements made it easier for me to understand the effect of the temp, terrain and hope had on the biclist."
"In the essay, the affect of the setting cyclist the features. One feature that affects him is his lack of water:"" The water bottles contained only a few tantallizing sips. The lack of water made him very desperate, especially when he came to the welchâ€™s grape juice factory. The  building-abandoned years earlier-had been a welchâ€™s grape juice factory and bottling plant."" This despersion, after he had come to the abondoned factory, was followed by dissapointment and a vague sense of hopelessness expressed by the phrase, ""I hung my head"" after he had found the abondoned factory. These are some of the features of the setting that affect the cyclist."
"In the story, â€œDo not exceed posted speed limitâ€, the affects way the setting that the cyclist rides. In this story, the setting is out in nowhere wit no water, and all he can see is roads. This affects the cyclist because he is hungry, thirsty,and now he's about to go down a really steep hill with fear of crashing and seriously insuring himself with noone around to get help from the setting of nowhere affects the cyclist in this story."
"The affects of the setting cyclist the features by not having good directions from old timers. In the text it says, ''Never accept travel advice, from a collection of old timers who havenâ€™t left the confines of their porches since carter was in the office,â€ this means that the cyclist did not have good directions. Because the road might of changed and the old timers do not know because they been sitting on there porches all the time. The is why I think the salling affects the cyclist."
"In the essay â€œDo Not Exceed Speed Limit,â€ the affected of the setting cyclist the features in a few ways. One way it affected him was that the temperature was very hot and by it being hot outside his water wouldnâ€™t stay cool. This is a problem because you need nice, cool, refreashing water to stay hydrated. Another way was when he hit a fork in the road. He didnâ€™t know which way to go. All he saw was one ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that couldnâ€™t hold the lamest mule greeted me. The sight was troubling. Last but not least this water pump wasnâ€™t working very well so he got down on his hands and knees and started pumping. The water wouldnâ€™t cool down. He tried a drop or two and the water tasted like battery acid. Those are some features of the setting that affected the cyclist on his journey."
 The affected of the setting cyclist the features a great deal. I say that because when there is peace and calmness then it motivates you more. Than when there is a lot en stuff around you.

 I the essays the affect of the setting cyclist the features by giving him hope. The cyclist takes directions by a few old men on a porch. The directions seem incorrect at first. The remains of a Grape Juice factory make it seem like he will never find civilization.
"The affect of the setting cyclist the features because they change the featuresâ€™s mood towards the rider. For example, in the essay â€œRough Road Ahead;Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limitâ€ it states, ""There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or sructure of any kind. I began breaking the ride clan into distances I could see on the horizonâ€ The cyclist had to do this because they were having trouble riding since they were thirsty and the ride was very boring. This makes the ride seem larges so it also makes it harder to ride. Also in the essay it states, ""One ramshackle shed, several rusty pumpsâ€ This affeted the cyclist because after seeing this and later realizing he couldâ€™t drink the water, he was more thirsty since he was running out of water. When the cyclist notices the Welchâ€˜s grape juice factory, he bacames determined to get there. In conclusion, the cyclist in the essay â€œRough Road Ahead"" by Joe Kurmaskie, the cyclist mood towards the ride is strongly affected by the settingâ€™s features."

 The affected cyclist the setting in many ways. When he was going up hill it was harder for him to pedal. The hot summer day was breaking him down. He was getting dehydrated because he had a little bit of water left. It said he was trying to keep his balance in my dehydrated state. He felt like giving up.
"The affect of the setting cyclist the features because the rougher the terrain got the more the features had to strain to make it. For example, when the terrain turned to hills, the cyclist had to struggle to climb the hills which caused him to use more of his energy. Also, if the terrain was flat and smooth, the cyclist had less problems making the long journey. For instance, if the cyclist had less strain on him then he would not be as tired and would not drink as much water. In conclusion, that is how the features of the setting affect the cyclist."

"In the adventures of the cyclist the setting is not only developes character the what but, that developes affects how he pushes himself to not give up, even when he feels helpless. This is one example of how the cyclist is affected, ""I had been hitting my water bottles pretty reguarly and I was traveling through the high desert of California in June,"" With that information you can observe how this harsh setting creates problems for him physicaly because his body needs water. Which he is extremely limited and doesn't savor it very well. These issues create the problem of dehydration, and when mentally you think your going to die without water. You start to panic and lose control over yourself."

"In ''Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted speed Limit'' by Joe Kurmaskie, the features of the setting most the disappoint him time. You can tell that the features of the setting disappointed him because every time he got to a town he couldnâ€™t get water. In the text it states, ''I got down on my hands & knees working the handle of the rusty water pump a for like substance oozed out followed by @NUM1 degree brackish water that tasted like battery acid.â€™â€™ You know the setting disappoints him when he sees the terrain he has to cross as well. You can tell who he says ''At some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path a ridicuously large snake.'' The narrarator was disappointed that he listened to the directions of the elder rather than use his map. Joe Kurmaskie does a great job of making one narrarator faced & how he felt about them."
"It substitute said that, ""is substitute a good experience for @CAPS1 instinct.â€ Thsubstitute means if someone knows how to deal with the environment they're in they can survive even if they weren't born with the animal instinct that come with the territory. However, even the most experienced person can be overcome by the extreme weather conditions they live in. In the essay, ""Rough Road Ahead,â€ by Joe Kurmaskie, the experienced cyclist decides to take a long, difficult, and dangerous trip. His ride will take him a long the long desert paths of California with a limited water supply. This is the major element that and him in the story. Because he listened to same old men he went without water for most of his trip. Between his constant excersise, extreme heat, and lack of water, dehydration hit him fast. A common side effect of dehydration is hallucination, which the cyclist knew. It says in the essay, â€œI wiped the sweat from my eyes to make sure it wasn`t mirage.â€ This represents his knowledge and experience in the matter, and showed that he was adapt to his environment through experience.

 The affects of the setting cyclist the features. Because the man didnâ€™t have a lot of water and he was go into the California deserts in June. Another reason is because the flat road was changed into rolling hills and up ahead there was a sign that said â€œRough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit.â€ the speed limit was @NUM1. One more thing is make sure you donâ€™t listen to a gentleman that is old and hadnâ€™t be off ther porch in decades. That is some of the things that can affect the cyclist.
"During texpierences cyclist journey in â€œRough Road Aexpierencesadâ€ by joe Kurmaskie expierences setting he changes such as texpierences road being flat texpierencesn going to short rolling hills. When hes wrideing he says the road is flat. â€œFlat road was replaced"" This tells us the road he was on was nice and flat. Then as hes rideing he notice the land change.â€ Flat road was replaced by, short rolling hills.â€ this tells us that the cyclist will have more trouble sence the terrain changed. Thatâ€™s how the land changes"
"The affect of the setting cyclist the features in many ways, they ware heat, lack of water, and hills. While on his journey he almost gets dehydrated because he does not have a good supply of water and he said they taste â€œlike battery acid.â€ And he had to convince up the road for anothe @NUM1 miles so that he could finally replenish himself"

"The decide of the setting including the conditions, weather, and amount of water can possibly life the feature or death of the cyclist. The conditions such as hills, and rocky roads can decied a future for a cyclist because if the rocky roads turn you off balance you could fall down a hill and give yourself an injury or possibly die. For example, in the short-story it says, â€œover one long crippling hill, a building came into viewâ€ This shows the conditions in which the cyclist had to deal with. In addition, the weather and amount os water can also decide the future. â€œThe water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips. Wide rings of sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke.â€ This shows us that if the cyclist gets dehydrated enough he could pass out and no one would find him in the desert. In addition, the heat isnâ€™t helping him out any once he could die without anyone knowing. These reasons show us a cyclist needs to make sure they have enough water and the conditons and weather is right so they donâ€™t make a life-threating choice."

"In the short story â€œDo not exeed the speed limitâ€ by Joe Kurmaskie, the has impact great setting on the cyclist. In the begining of the story he describes the scenery as ""@CAPS1"". As he continued following the old mens out dated advice. It lead  him through more barren lands. When he came to the first ""town"" he described it as a ghost town. The second setting he arrived at was â€œOne romshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that couldnt hold in the lamest muicâ€ he continued moving to the next town, which was @NUM1 away, he came to what he thought was a Welch's Grape juice factory and bootling plant. This tools a toll on his confidence because he said ""I hung my head"" he moved on and had finally arrived at un abandoned buiding called ""@PERSON2 and wilbersâ€™s fish camp. ""This is where he drunk water and became repleshed. The setting had a great effect on the cyclist. Because depending on the location, decided weather he would live or die in the hot deserts of California."
"In the short story â€œ Rough Road Ahead Do not exceed pusted speed limit.â€ A affeced of things cyclist lot. Such as the rocky road , and the lack of water for example where the author says â€œwhen I tried a drop or two, It had the flavor of battery acid.â€ this shows how has loosing lope, and he seems a little scared. Also the abandond towns  didnâ€™t help."
"The affect of the setting cyclist the features greatly. At first it was flat road which the speaker was happy with and he had â€œa smile on.â€ (@NUM1). Then came large rolling hills which created a challenge, the cyclist needed to muster up enough energy to continue. The rough terrain was next causing the cyclist to work even harder to cycle. As if the rough terrain wasnâ€™t energy soaking enough, a snake blocked a majority of pavement and large elevations came into play. The harder the terrain, the harder for the cyclist."
"The setting in â€œDo not exceed posted affects cyclist the speed limit in many ways. The old men told the cyclist there were flat roads on the path he was to take, when the cyclist got there, there were hills not flat roads. The cyclist traveled through the desert to get to his destination. He started to run out of water because it was so hot and humid. He started to get dehydrated and could bairly keep his balance. In this story the cyclist had to pass a large snake â€œa ridiculously large"" snake â€“ it realy didnâ€™t look like a diamondback â€“ blocked a majority of the pavement in front of me â€œ(Kurmaskie). The snake was big and the cyclist had to work his best to pass it while wobbling from dehydration. The settings in this story had effect on the cyclist in many ways."
"The affect of the setting cyclist the features for many readers after another. @CAPS1 are some examples why the cyclist was bike riding down a windy road. He is in a hot place similar to a desert. It is very hot there and is affecting him during his travels,""I eased past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state. Another thing that affected him because of the setting was that the desert had rocky roads and windy paths because he followed the old mans direction. ""Rough Road Ahead"" are final example is that he was in the desert so he saw a snake come out of the tumbleweeds."" A large snake it really did look like a diamond back."" @CAPS1 are three examples how the cyclist had been affected due to the setting of the story."
"The affect of the setting â€™s mood the cyclistfeatures towards the journey. At first, he is confident that the old menâ€™s knowledge of the land is accurate and he is excited about what lies ahead for him. However, his excitement soon turned into dismay and slight doubt as his journey drags on. The heat of the weather and lack of water makes the cyclist develop an uncaring matter. â€œIâ€™d read once that sucking on stones helpsâ€¦with any luck Iâ€™d hit a bump and lodge one in my throat.â€ The verbal irony in this passage delivers a negative feeling to the reader and it is here that it is clear that the cyclist doesnâ€™t care what happens to him. When he finally reaches a sign of civilization, the cyclist becomes himself again and decides that his knowledge is best."
"The   affect  of the   setting   does cyclist the features. For example, if it is hot outside then he would need more water than normal. Also if it was raining he would have to drive more careful. That is why the setting would affect the cyclist."
"The can affect around people in certain situations them environment in many ways. For instance if  you are hot, tree could be shade, or thirsty, a river neer by could help your thirst. If you were hungry and hot, but nothing was near you this could make you hot. In this cyclist case the environment affected him in many ways, from bumpy roads, â€œghost towns, and trees. For example he said, â€œThe sun was beginning to beat down, but I barley noticed,â€ this is because of the ""cool pines"" around him as he explains in the next paragraph. It also says in the text that the terrain changed and he even came upon a snake, which added to his thirst. So then making it harder for him to go one. From reading the the text on can see how features can have effects on a person."
 The makes hapy the cyclist scenery. Heâ€™s sooooooooooooo happsy! Woohoo! happsy
 The affected and setting in the story cyclist the features because they made his journey to Yosemite even harder. In the story it says that it was so hot he could drop dead from heatstroke. Also his lack of water made him extreamly tired as he petaled. Next the sun was beating down so not only was he tired due to his lack of water but also because of it being so hot out he was loosing water and energy from his sweat. Thats why the features and setting made his journey to YoSemite difficult.

"The affected of the setting cyclist the features in positive and negative ways. At first, there were the two old men who gave the cyclist the out-of-date information. They affected him negatively because if it wasnâ€™t for them, the cyclist would have never gotten lost. When the cyclist arrived at the first town, the water pump affected him, the cyclist was running out of water and the water from the water pump tasted like battery acid and was about @NUM1Â°. The cyclist was becoming more and more dehydrated and the small, rolling hills didnâ€™t help his dehydration, he also used a lot of energy in order to go over the hills. Finally, he found Gary and Wilberâ€™s fish camp where he was able to get water. This whole experience in a way, affected the cyclist positively even though, at the time, he was affected negatively. The cyclist learned to not take advice from really old people who â€œhavenâ€™t left the confines of their porches since Carter was in office.â€ The cyclist was affected positively and negatively by the features of the setting."

"One of the biggest problems that the was faced in his essay surroundings his author. The setting of the story in Yosemite provided many obstacles such as the vastness of the park, the summer heat, and the fact that many places had been abandoned. The summer heat was the biggest problem for the cyclist. He had to bike many miles, but he only had limited supply of water. Eventually, his water supply began to run low, which increased his determination to find the next town before he collapsed. It is this determination which moves him from ghost town to ghost town and keeps the story moving. Another big problem was the vastness of Yosemite National Park, which he was biking through. Any wrong turns (which he took, thanks to the direction he was given) could get him lost and thrown off track for a very long time. It was his confusion as to where the next time was that kept him biking, with difficulty and made for an interesting story. An example of the vastness of the park was when he quote, â€œAbout forty miles into the pedal, I arrived at the first â€˜town.â€™ This place might have been a thriving spot at one time-say, before the last world war-but on that morning it fit the traditional definition of a ghost town.â€ This quote shows that even after many miles, he hadnâ€™t seen a sign of anyone living, which would have increased his desperation to keep looking for civilization."
"The afects in the setting in the story cyclist the features in many ways. For example in the story it said, â€At same point, tumple weed crossed my path.â€ This is saying that he is in the desert or somewhere very hot because I know that you usually only see tumple weeds in very hot places. Thus, being in the desert affect the cyclist because he is already low on water then being  in a place as hot as the desert made him get even nor dehydrated. Another feature in the setting in this story that affected the cyclest is the hills he had to climb. This affected him because he was already  dehydrated and climbing hills made him have to work more which caused him to lose more sweat and become even more dehydrated. Those are two examples of how the features in the setting of this story affected the cyclest."
"The affect of the setting cyclist the features because his body has a hard time adjusting to his life threating situation. The neat and desert atmosphere are draining his body of water, @CAPS1 he needs to keep pedaling on. Also, the terrain is stripped of water, so he doesn't have anything to refuel with."

"The affect cyclist the settings in many ways on the way to Yosemite. Well for one when he took the shortcut, one thing that already made it difficult was that it was June, and heâ€™s out in the desert. Also it says how he went to a couple towns that were deserted so there was no way to replenish his water. It says, â€œI pumped that handle for several minutes, but the water wouldnâ€™t cool down. When I tried a drop or two, it had the flavor of battery acid.â€ @CAPS1 thing about his setting that changed was the hills. But once he came to a bait shop, the old man asks  him if he  knows the best way to get to Yosemite, and he responds, â€œyes- sir: I own a very good map.â€ @CAPS2 by this heâ€™s understood that the best way to travel anywhere is the path or road he knows because heâ€™ll know what to expect. This is how the setting changed."
 The affect of the setting cyclist the features in many ways. One of the ways are that it is affecting him is that the discription of it makes it seem hotter then what it really is. He says â€œneihbor hood of two hundred degrees.â€ He is saying that it is really hot. The features of the setting affected him because I mad it seem hoter and he was taking it to far.
"The can change corse the wether of action a cyclist will take. If it is cold out side then the cyclist will bring beveyer cloths if its. Hoter out side he would most likly bring lighter clothes. If he was riding farther hed bring more supplys like water and food If he was going on a short rid then he wouldnâ€™t bring so much stuff. The way the wether is changes the way a person will prepaire,"
"The affected of the essay greatly cyclist the setting. These settings discourage him, although he tries to keep hope. Seeing dry desert, hills begin to heighten, nothing man-made is in sight. These subconsciously affect the cyclist and his growth of thirst. To one point the cyclists original objective became invalidated for his thirst pangs and exhaustion."
"The affect of the setting cyclist the feateres in many ways. For example ""not two mlles into this next section of the ride, I noticed the terrain changin. Flat road was replaced by short, rolling  hills. ""This affected the cyclist because he had to pedal  harder to go up the hills and he got short of breath due to this. Another example  is, ""At some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path and a rediculously large snake-it really did look like a diamondback-blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me.â€ This affected the cyclist because he had to wait for the snake to move so it didnt bite him while he crossed it. One last example is, ""As I stumbled into a rather modem bathroom and drank deeply from the sink, I had an overwhelming urge to seek out @PERSON1 and Wilberâ€ This had an affect on the cyclist because he was now hapy to have water and have reached his destination."
"Many affect that the author talks about in the story him things: One example in the oldmen that give things advice. They tell him that they know a great shortcut which turns into the authors hardest ride ever. Another example is: the heat, the location, time of day, and time of the year. In California, in @DATE1 in the dessert will give you lots of heat. In order to beat this heat you need lots of water which is one of his biggest problems. He runs out of water. Another hindering thing he discovers is the abandoned welches grape juice building where he sees a picture of a boy drinking a refreshing glass of grape juice. All these combined gave the author a hard time but in the end he found a bait and tackle shop where he was saved"

"The affect the cyclist experianced during his ride body his features and mind. At first the cyclist was on flat graund, drinking plenty of water and without fear. But when he came to his second town, he became ton on water. This troubled him, but he was optomistic telling himself â€œthe next town was only eighteen miles.â€ After this the road was replaced by short, rolling hills.â€ this started to trouble him. Dehydration started to set him and every hill was a challenge. Once out of water he sucked on pebbles and hopped it would â€œtake your mind off of thirst.â€ When he finally made it, he was so relieved.

 The setting of the essay â€œRough Road Ahead: Do Not posted speed limit Exceedâ€ affected the cyclest greatly. He was riding through a desert in June. This meant that the temperature was very high.

 The affects of the setting cyclist the features because he knows heâ€™s in the wrong area. The cyclist understand's that he should have never took that advice from them old men. So he was upset and new he should have taken his advise. The cyclist had a feeling that he wasnâ€™t supposed to take it that way he said he shouldnâ€™t have let them take a peek at his map. So the features really affect him.
 The effected of the setting cyclist the features. The setting was a desert in California making it VERY hot outside. The hills were hard to climb and there were dangers all around such as poisonous snakes. Not just this was terrain hard to move around on but the path was thickest. â€œ@CAPS1 weeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake.â€ This made it harder for the cyclist to reach his destination.
"The affect of the setting cyclist the features. He is trying to get water but when he tried the pump, â€œa tarlike substance oozed out, followed by brackish water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degreesâ€. The cyclist doesnâ€™t have any water so it is difficult to go on. He could suffer from heat exhaustion. As he came to the next town, he found, â€œthe building - abandoned years earlier, had been a Welchâ€™s Grape Juice Factory and bottling plantâ€. He is still thinking of getting to the next town to get something to drink. That is how the features of the setting affect the cyclist."
"In the story were features many there of the setting tha affected the cyclist. One that had the greatest impact was that it was dry and hot, and that the terrain was very rough in the desert. Being that it was dry and hot made his ride hard. For example, the heat caused him to get dehydrated on his journey and begin to feel signs of heatstroke. The terrain caused an even bigger dilema. For example, in the story him riding through that terrain causes him to get tired and become even more dehydrated than he already is."
"The affect of the setting extremely adjust the features in the ride to the meet town. It was bad enough that the adjust the out of water but on top of that by faced, rolling wills, makes and hard road condition all of these setting played a huge will in the cyclist puformance, ""it motued the terrain changing. that way was replaced by that rolling hills."" He also says ""tumbleweed around my matt and a includesouly change snake it really did look like a demand luck blocked the majority of the movement in front of me. These setting made it difficult for the adjust to reform because the hills snakes and tumbleweed disturbed the adjust to advanced in the ride. He ran out of water no it was hard to reduce up will and the night of a deadly snake made the adjust named and worked to the difficulty of pufornenance for the cyclist"
 The affect of the setting cyclist the features was like saying you are old and that you know nothing at all. But it is not true. It means you are older and that your information @MONTH1 not be correct for example in the essay when he was on his way to the town he learned to use his map instead of a guys opinion because the guy was wrong.

"The DO NOT EXCEED of the setting in â€œLIMIT POSTED SPEED featuresâ€ affect the cyclist in a negative way. The terrain goes from being very mild to rough and rolling. Considering that the author does not know the layout of this terrain very well, he begins to struggle. The author is very unsure of where to go and begins encountering obstacles such as, tumbleweed, snakes and lack of water. The fact that the author is running out of water, makes continuing on a very stressful. He is worried that he will die of dehydration before he ever reaches Yosemite National Park. Finally, with much strength and determination, he reaches a fish a Fish camp. He is able to fill his water supply and regain his strength before pressing on."
"The affected cyclist the setting because the terrain you ride on can determine how you ride. For instance when you have hills and dry weather like they did when it said â€œflat road was replaced by short, rolling hillsâ€ The one easy terrain was now made more difficult and only added to his frustration and his dehydration from having no water. Also the heat contributed plenty and it was there the whole time. Sometimes he didnâ€™t seem to notice or feel it but it was there and it was taking energy from him: Like when it said, â€œThe sun was beginning to beat down, but I barely noticed it.â€ He didnâ€™t know it but that took from him so he drank more water and that affected his ability to take enough to complete the ride."

"The affect of the setting cyclist the features by the changes the occur while riding his bike. The cyclist began well with smily face, but then he changed because the condition of the road and the weather that was hot, also there was not any signal to show him where he was going and it was the correct way he was taking. Also, his bike flat needed to be replaced."

"In the story â€œRough Road Aheadâ€ a takes some cyclist out of rate information from a couple of old guys as he went along following there directions he found out that there directions were out of rate and at points dangerous. Also the setting didnâ€™t help because he was in a desert with ghost towns and it was very hot it didnt help him believe he was going to make it out alive. For example in the story when he enters the  fork in the road it says he found â€œseveral rusty pumps,â€ and â€œone ramshackle shed.â€ This probably didnt help him because he didnâ€™t have alot of water left and it was really hot and he was losing confidence in himslef that he went get out and there were rusty pumps so he couldnâ€™t get any water that was good. Also in the story it says that â€œThere was no one in sight, not a bulding, car, or structure of any kindâ€ and that setting affected him because in this part in the story he has cycled for a while and he has no water left and he is getting very exhausted a almost has no energy. Also it decreased his hopes because it says there wasnt a building, or a car anything so it was pretty, much a empty dessert that he was stuck in and he thought he wouldnâ€™t setent of the dessert alive. In conclusion in the story â€œRough road aheadâ€ the setting in the story didnâ€™t help the cyclist in his hope or confiendce of setting out because the setting was very abanded and also it was very hot and it didnâ€™t help that he was in a desert."
 In this story the affects cyclist the setting in many ways. He tries to get directions but the people he asked really didnt know what they were talking about. Thats why you have to be careful on who you ask. Then he needs a drink but that dosent work out to well because the water ends up tasting like battery acid. Then the cyclist begins to be on his way again and finds same difficulty in the road. The same difficulty in the road. The road is in bad condition and must do slower then the speed limit. At this point it felt like he was gonna die. Lucky he found a bathroom and drank from the sink.

"In the story ""Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Limit,"" the affected of the setting greatly cyclist the features. As he was riding, he was passing through desert during June, a very hot month.There is not much water present in a desert (that would be part of the definition of a desert) and so, particularly in the even-hotter-than-normal June sun, he was at risk of running out of water. Had he been driving through, say, a forest or perhaps rolling grasslands, he might not have been in such danger, and could have merely looked for a river or dreck for water if he was desperate. Another thing that might have affected the cyclist would have been the affect of the desert on his mind. When people think of deserts they often think of dry, barren wastelands, complete with buzzards and maybe a dead cowskull, as in movies. Deserts are in intimidiating, they have a bad reputation and so, as he was riding through and was low on water thought of death how he was, ""going to die and the birds would pick (him) clean"" running through his now-teriffied head. Had he been in a city or in rolling farmland he might not have been as terrified. There are people in those places, and places to be safe there, but, in his desert, he had neither, allowing him to give way to despair. Setting does a lot to influence stories, so it is important to keep that in mind when reading."
"The affect of the setting cyclist the features because he is in a dessert like place with a water surfage and he could hard tired. I would never have asked old people, he should have ask someone that was in charge of a store, because those people get asked many times. also he could have died if that snake got him or from what he said â€œheatroke.â€"

"In thad author's recollection of his long and tiresome bike ride had talked about thad struggles had to face he. when he set out that morning he asked some old guys on a porch for directions to @CAPS1. They told him that they knew the way and that they knew a shortcut. He choose to take their advice but later regreted it. when he found the towns that they spoke of all he found was ghost towns. ""Never accept travel advice from a collection of old-timers who haven't left the confines of their porches since carter was in office. ""He dose eventually reach a town were he finds signs of life. There he asks another old guy if he knows the way to Yosemite, the guy says he has a good map. All along his ride he was pleged by the sun and lack of watrer. The sun made him hot and thirsty which forced him to drink a lot of his water. when he rached his last few sips he resisted from drinking it and began loosing consciesness. ""I could drop from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June."""

These conditions of the setting all effect the cyclist."
"In the text, the author was cycling to Yosemite park through a desert dehydrated him which and changed his mood. Going through this desert he ran out of water so he stopped. Some of the  towns he was told of which turned out to be deserted, and as he could not find water there he soon because dehydrated. This is the obvious affect the setting had on him, another affect was to cause him to doubt old people and to change his mood from confident to desperate. As he was cycling through the desert, desperately chinging to life in hopes he could find, are water, he realized that old people know of the past better than the future as they donâ€™t get out to the every changing world as much as they used to whereas, at the beginning he was confident in the directions and wisdom of the old men. The setting he was in made him a little more wise."
"The affect of the setting cyclist the features by dehydrating him. The cyclist said, â€œI toiled on. At some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake."" The cyclist was in the desert and each mile he rode he became more and more dehydrated. The desert sun drying out his body. He said with each passing landmark, â€œI eased past trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state.â€  @CAPS1 that the more he went on the more the desert affected him and dehydrated him."
"were land features many There that affected the cyclist and his trip. First of all, it is a desert, which greatly affects him as there is no water in deserts. There was also a snake, which could have bit and kiiled him. As the road were not very well paved and had obviously been abandoned for years it made cycling much harder for him. And the juice factory just taunted him, making him remember his need for water, as did the well that did not pump cold water, but instead pumped hot,gross water"

And the juice factory just taunted him, making him remember his need for water, as did the well that did not pump cold water, but instead pumped hot,gross water"
"The affect of the setting cyclist the features in a few ways. first of these is the blazing heat. He is basically in a desert and he is running low on water. As he starts to run out of water he starts conserving it which is dehydrating him so he is becoming weaker, â€œI would conserve my water and go inward for an hour or so- a test of my inner spirit. Next up is the rough terrain. When you hit rough terrain on a bike it can get hard to keep going and the cyclist was already short on water â€œa large highway sign jumped out at me. I read: rough road ahad: Do not exceed posted speed limit sometimes life can be so cruelâ€œ. Finally is the structure First there was the Ghost town with the â€œbattery acidâ€ tasting water. Also there was the Welchâ€™s grape Juice factory and bottling plant which were both probably dimeriling. â€œA sandblusted picture of a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth could still be seen. I hung my headâ€. As you can see the features of the settings generily affected the cyclist."
"The is crulest the desert of natureâ€™s environments. Its lack of water, dry air, and punishing heat are enough to kill even the hardiest creature. When traveling through a desert, one must maintain a constant water supply and know their path with respect to the power of nature in â€œDo Not Exceed Posted Speed Limitâ€, cycler Joe Kurmaskie must overcome the desertâ€™s heat and lack of water to survive. As the author observes in paragraph @NUM1, â€œwide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, I could drop from heatstroke.â€ If the human body overheats, it becomes sick and unable to properly function. When in the desert one must keep cool or perish. In @NUM2, Kurmaskie begins to realize the danger of running out of water in the desert, â€œ I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly, and I was travelling through the high deserts of California in June. â€œAs this water starts to run out, Joe suffers from dehydration, despair, and a loss of balance. Water is essential in a desert environment, without it, as Joe observes, â€œthe birds would pick (you) clean, leaving only some expensive out door gearâ€."
"The many affected of the setting cyclist the features in many different ways. The beauty of nature around him affected him by making him laugh. In the essay, it says, â€œ on a gorgeous day in June caused him to laugh.â€ This shows, despite what happened, he was might are on a nice day outside giving him an optimistic attitude. Also, the beating sun affected him in a different way. It caused him to sweat and almost die of dehydration. â€œ growing realization that l could drop from heatstroke â€ This shows that he was tensely aware that he could die from the suns might. So, the settings around the cyclist affected him in different ways."
"The affect of the nearby setting cyclist the features in a bad way. The four main things that affect him are the heat, lack of water, lack of nearby buildings, and @CAPS2. For this cyclist one of the biggest problems is the heat. He saysâ€ i was travelling through the high deserts of California in Juneâ€. this shows that it is quite hot outside by the month stated. June is quite a hot month especially in @CAPS1 deserts. The second problem is the cyclist lack of water. He says throughout the story how thirsty he is and how much he needs to drink some water. When he reaches the end, however he finds water. The third problem is when he needs water, he canâ€™t find anywhere due to the lack of buildings. He pedals great distances trying to find â€œtownsâ€ nearby. Once he finds them, they are either â€œghost townsâ€ or are not useful at all. The final problem he faces is the @CAPS2. He says â€œAt some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snakeâ€¦ blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me.â€ @CAPS2 is getting in his way and not helping him to reach his destination at all. Truly . the features of the nearby setting are affecting him in a tramatizing way, because so many things like heat, lack of water , buildings, and @CAPS2 are inches way."
 The affected of the setting cyclist the features because he was really thirsty and then the dry air with no town nearby made it even worse. There was also the bumpy roads and hills that were tiring and mad the cyclist even thirstier. Finnally there was the factory that made him think about juice and made him thirstier yet.
 The affect of the setting cyclist the features by old people changing the definition of adonâ€™t talk to strangers. The main character
 The affect of the setting cyclist the features because real features know what the speed is for a bike so you donâ€™t need to tell them. If a cyclist needed some dierections they would go to a gas station not to some old personâ€™s house. A real cyclist can go as long as they want before the stop because they are tired. A real cyclist knows haw to do tricks on a bike donâ€™t have to do them over and over again to be able to do them. A real cyclist doesnâ€™t have to train to go into a tourtement and win they must have to practice to be able to win.
"The did not help of the setting cyclist the features on his trip. First of all he was in the desert on a bike! Which helped him dehydrate faster. Secondly, the â€˜townsâ€™ around the way  had been abandoned, leaving no place to get more water and no place to ask for directions. Lastly there were no other people around so if the cyclist was to get into trouble, he wouldn't be able to find help."
"In the story, â€œDo not exceed postal speed limit,â€ many affect of the setting cyclist the features. First and most importantly, he is affected by the people who live there. â€œNever accept travel advice from a group of old- timers who havenâ€™t left the confines of their porch since Carter was in office.â€ This quote describes the feelings the cyclist has towards the old men. Because he listened to their directions, he traveled through ghost towns and hourly died from dehydration. Also, the lack of people and civilization affected the author. There was no one around that he could ask for help from. â€œâ€¦but on that morning it fit the traditional definition of a ghost town. Here, the author is trying to stop for water, but since no one lives in the town any more, he gets none. Finally, the lack of water has a huge effect on the cyclist. â€œThat smoky blues tune â€œSummer timeâ€ rattled around in the dry honey combs of my deteriorating brain.â€ This describes how the author is really dehydrated and he feels like his brain is drying up. However, his need for water makes him more determined than ever to keep going until he reaches another town, or this goal destination of reaching Yosemite National Park."
"The affect of the setting man the features in featuresy ways. One way is that when the man notices the terrain starting to change, he becomes more and more distrought. He  sees the sign that sats â€œ Rough road ahead: Do not exceed pasted speed limitâ€ it is almost as if he thinks the sign is mocking him. Also, when the rider says â€œ In an @CAPS1 twist that should please all sadistsâ€¦â€ he is telling the reader that this situation is very ironic and that he was expecting nothing."
"The is affecting of the environmental setting cyclist the features. A setting is a certain time and place an event is taking place along with the setting their are features, which is the background description basically giving away additional information about the subject or idea. The features along with the setting are intefering with the cyclist by the hot temperature in Lodi, California making the cyclist or biker hotter than usualier as he heads in the wrong direction closer and nearer to the hot blazen scroaching desert. In addition to this he is running out of water and is beginning to get more and more exhausted from the heat plus he is starting to lose consciousness along with getting dehydrated. This is a major problem for the character because he is losing his sense of direction and because of this he is getting more panickly as his supply of water is running extremely low. A instance of the environmental setting affecting the cyclist is â€œI eased past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state. The water bottle contained only a few tantalizing sips. Wide rings of dried sweet circled my skirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from heartstroke on a gorgeous in June ""(Joe Kurmaskie, @NUM1)."" @CAPS1 example is â€œThis sight was troubling. I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly and I was travelling through the high deserts of California in June â€œ(Joe Kurmaskie, @NUM2)â€. The hotness and heat had also increased the characterâ€™s confidence in himself as he was getting more and more panickly. A instance of this is â€œI began breaking the ride down into distances. I could see on the horizon, telling myself that if I could make it this far, Iâ€™d be fine â€œ(Joe Kurmaskie, @NUM1). In conclusion, the hot setting in California had affected the cyclist in a number of ways it had exhasted his water supply and this caused him to become exhausted, dehydrated, and making him lose his logically sense to make decisions however his loss of sense of direction also gave him more self confidence as he stirved to the roads and serves town that was about twenty miles away in order to get water so that he @MONTH1 survive."
"The affect of the setting cyclist the features in the essay â€œRough Road Aheadâ€ by Joe Kurmaskie in many ways. One way the setting affected the cyclist way when it got hot and the rider was running out of water. another way the cyclist was affected by the setting was when he said he ""could die of heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June simply because of listened to some gentlemen who hadnâ€™t been off their porch in decades caused me to laugh. a third way the cyclist was affected was was when he went inside the bait shop and cooled down. lastly when he rehydrated himself in the  so the setting was a main factory to the cyclist in the essay â€œRough Road Aheadâ€ by Joe kurmaskie on his way to Yosemite national park."
 The is of thto tell Essay to tell setting cyclest were to go without getting them lost and to never take advice from old people.
"In the essay â€œRough Road Ahead: Do not exceed Speed limitâ€ this many different took toll its settings on the cyclist. For example in the beginning he started out with a nice smooth ride. But it was very hot. Then he began to get into a hort rolling hills which were taking thier toll on his legs. Then we entered into a rough are where he had to be more careful. The roughness prolly wore him out from all the bumps and bounces. He went through a lot on that bike trip, who know he @MONTH1 have never made at back to where he was staying."
 One was that effected the cyclist hills the rolling feature. The  â€œtext states â€œ two miles into the section... I noticed  the terrain changingâ€¦
 One feature that effected the was hills the rolling cyclist. The  â€œtext states â€œ two miles into the section... I noticed  the terrain changingâ€¦
 The affect of the setting cyclist the features in the good way. For examples he would be in good shape because cycling is a sport. He would be rich because he would win the contest of cycling.
"are things many There that could affect affect the cyclist. Like when they said ,â€ tomble weeds crossed my path is a ridiculously large snake.â€ @CAPS1 her example would be when they saidâ€ Not two miles into this next section of the ride I noticed the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills. That is how the features of the setting affect the cyclist."
"The older gave him men directions that were acctully really bad. Nature wasnâ€™t on is side thatâ€™s for sure. First of all he ran out of water because of the heat. Secondly a snake blocked his path and he didnâ€™t want to tempt it. Thirdly he became so overheated that it was possible for him to suffer a heat stroke in the middle of nowhere. Also he kept going to abandoned buildings. It was so bad that the stone relied on for his thirst got stuck in his throat, he was then lead to a bait shop that was absolutely in the middle of nowhere and he had no way of getting home."

"The affected of the setting cyclist the features. The dry desert affected the cyclist because these was no water and the cyclist was dehydrated. The strong heat, because the cyclist could bare had a heat stroke. The animals because the snake could have killed the cyclist and these was no one in miles to help. In the story it says, â€œThese was no one in sight, not a bulling, car or structure of any kind,â€ If the cyclist had needed help then the  cyclist could most likely have died. if I was the cyclist, I probably would have given up by then but Iâ€™m glad the cyclist didn`t. The features of the setting affected the cyclist because of the many things that could make happened to him."
"The affect in the short story cyclist the feature because with no towns around there is now water. In the story is says, â€œThe water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips.â€ This means the cyclist was short on water and needed to find a town soon. Cycling in the desert and up down hills made it harder and hotter. The heart could cause dehydration or a heatstroke because it says, â€œand the growing realization that I could drop from heatstrokeâ€ the buildings the cyclist did see were not any help to him because they had no water. Eventually he came to a fishing camp and found water in the sink of the bathroom. The story says, â€œI stumbled into a rather modern bathroom and drank deeply from the sink.â€ This is where the setting changes because the cyclist found cool water finally."

"In â€œRough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limitâ€, the faces obstacles many author because of the different terrain changes on his journey to Yosemite National Park. Taking advice from a group of old men, he headed to his first stop. The old men said he would see a town but what he really saw was a sort of ruined ""ghost"" town. Then he came to a fork in the road and was running out of water. He had been riding on flat road when the terrain dramatically changed. It became hilly and very inconsistent. This sudden change in terrain caused him to get more tired, thirsty, and hot. The cyclist then came to a huge hill and, using his last bit of energy, rode down. He was exhausted. All the terrain changes not only changed the cyclistâ€™s physical state, but his mood and determination as well."
"The affect cyclist the setting in many ways. ""The journey nass make an snake this quote and that there made it seem like he is in the middle of know were and is ulcoming no plass because the man on the pourch said it would not be to far. The first town also was empty and when saw the town he was excited to go and feel a little out when he got closer he realized that the town has been abandoned this whole time so he was forced to keep going out the empty town made him feel almost hopless. In his attempts to make it to that next town, that how the setting mos affected the cyclist in the way that it did."
"The affect in the setting cyclist the features in many different ways. One way is he is round stuck with only a little bit of water. â€œThe water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips.(Kurmaskie). Also the cyclist was lost because of the old men directions that got him know where because there directions were out of date. â€œNever accept travel advice from a collection of old-timers who havenâ€™t left the confine of their porches since carter was in office,â€ (Kurmaskie @NUM1). He was giving bad directions and wasnt to pleased. Therefore the cyclist went through some though times."
"The affect of the setting cyclist the features because he thinks after a nice afternoon in a nice campground a shortcut to his next destination would be very nice. He thinks the shortcut will be a nice way to relax than to take the original longer way to Yosemite. But the trip he makes changes his mind a lot. In the essay the narrator is talking about what the old guys had told him. He says, â€œThe old guys had sworn the next town only eighteen miles down the road. I could make that. I would conserve my waterâ€¦â€ He did conserve his water but the town was very old and didnâ€™t have any water for him to drink. So throughout the essay the narrator went without water until he got to a factory, got some water to drink, and got new directions. The trip was very different from what he had expected. It was more depressing."
 Many affect in the setting cyclist the things. The first thing that affects him is the heat. The heat is actually what causes the conflict in the story of the cyclist needing water. If the heat was not present in the story than the cyclist would not have such a need for water and he would be able to continue on his ride without fear of dehydration. Another aspect of the setting that affect the cyclist are the rolling hills. These hills also exhaust the cyclist and cause him to need more water. If these hills were gone than the cyclist would have tirerd less quickly making his journey easyer. The setting in this story greatly affects the cyclist.
"In  rough raod ahead by Joe Kurmaskie the affected of the setting cyclist the feature. Because he was in the desert of California in June, he water supply was emicated and he came across a ghost town. His hope was dwindling because of this. He found a water pump that produced a tar like substance as a result the desert and the lack of water made him wish he was dead he decided never to take advice from strangers and to trust his map. That is how the feature affected the setting."
"In the story â€œDo not exceed posted speed Limitâ€, the is trying to get cyclist to Yosemite with directions that some codgers, or eccentric old men, gave him. The cyclist, said the old men looked as though they, â€œhavenâ€™t left the confines of their poaches since carter was in office. â€œ  Well, he takes their advice, and he gets lost about @NUM1 along on his journey. While looking forward to the â€œCool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemiteâ€â€™ he was traveling through a barren desert. â€œThere was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind.â€ This type of setting could really bring down a cultistâ€™s mood while thinking of Yosemite. It could make him lose all hope of ever finding Yosemite at this rate. If you have a nice setting, it makes the trip worthwhile, and your ending point even better."

"The affect of the setting cyclist the features. It seems to be the more despirate the situation the more determand her becomes. Pg @NUM1 (I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean). Right after he thinks this he climbed away for the abandoned factory of Juices and dreams. He says pg @NUM1 come troubles, thirst and tean where all behind me, this shows that after a situation the bilaver tells realeoved of all earthley obligations. Not only does the settings affect the cyclist but the entire story around him."
