All of these are further developed by the settings where they take place, For example after taking advice from old men at a campsite, he is on his way through the deserts of California.

"Ghost towns are not exactly the most inviting place for a cyclis trunning low on water supply. In “Rough road ahead: do not exceed speed limit” the cyclist is affected in many ways by his surrounding settings. Starting off on a warm day with the sun bright start off as a good thing, while his mood is still fresh and happy expressions play on his face. But as he moves on he speaks of how “The sun was beginning to beat down” expressing his remorse of listening to the old men that led him on their “shortcut.” Along the road he comes to his first let-down, a ghost town with “one ramshackle shop, several rusty pumps and a corral that couldn’t hold the lamest male.” @CAPS1 he tries to pump the water from the corral but gets a “battery-acid” flavor and is forced to continue onward with little left to drink. This affects his mood to pity for himself and anger at the men who put him into the predicament.The average person's left hand does 56% of the typing (when using the proper position of the hands on the keyboard; Hunting and pecking doesn't count!)..The ""sixth sick sheik's sixth sheep's sick"" is believed to be the toughest tongue twister in the English language..The longest one-syllable words in the English language are ""scraunched"" and ""strengthed.""

"The setting puts a great deal of stress on the cyclist. The biggest issue he faces is the weather. He is a cyclist “traveling through the high deserts of @LOCATION1 in June.” He had been riding his bike all day and he was soon going to run out of water. Just when he thought he could drink more water, he drank “water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees.” The weather being so hot and humid, did not help the cyclist throughout his journey. Another factor of the setting that affected the cyclist was the terrain. “Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills,” is a main problem the cyclist faced. These changes in terrain played into the fact that the weather did not cooperate.

He did see windy rivers or trails hidden beneath all kinds of trees. He didn’t see any people or friendly little forest critters. Instead he just saw the same rusty color of dirt and the occasional snake. His mood was affected and he started to lose confidence and hope.

"In the short story “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” by Joe Kurmaskie. the setting greatly affects the cyclist and his mindset. When the scenery is pretty and cheery, he is happy as well. This is shown when the author writes, “denyoved the serenity of an early- summer- evening.” This quote describes the scenery as a serre or peaceful place. His happiness is found in the first part of the quote when he said, “denyoyed” One does not enjoy something unless they are happy or in a cherry mindset. Therefore, the peaceful scery affected the cyclist by making him happy. the same can be said for merry scenery too. This is found when the author says, “At some point, tumble weeds crossed my path and the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke”. This quote, describes the scenery as a place that they tumbleweeds. Steryotypically, tumbleweeds are found in dreary and lonely place. This lonely scenery takes it if full on the cyclist.

In the essay, ""Rough Road Ahead,” by Joe Kurmaskie, the experienced cyclist decides to take a long, difficult, and dangerous trip. His ride will take him a long the long desert paths of California with a limited water supply. This is the major element that and him in the story. Because he listened to same old men he went without water for most of his trip. Between his constant excersise, extreme heat, and lack of water, dehydration hit him fast.

"One of the biggest problems that the author faced in his essay was his surroundings. The setting of the story in Yosemite provided many obstacles such as the vastness of the park, the summer heat, and the fact that many places had been abandoned. The summer heat was the biggest problem for the cyclist. He had to bike many miles, but he only had limited supply of water. Eventually, his water supply began to run low, which increased his determination to find the next town before he collapsed. It is this determination which moves him from ghost town to ghost town and keeps the story moving. Another big problem was the vastness of Yosemite National Park, which he was biking through. Any wrong turns (which he took, thanks to the direction he was given) could get him lost and thrown off track for a very long time. It was his confusion as to where the next time was that kept him biking, with difficulty and made for an interesting story.Cucumbers are actually a fruit and not a vegetable.

"The cyclist in “Rough Road @CAPS1; Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” starts off in the “serenity of an easly summer evening” taking road advice from old-timers. At first when the sun was beating down on him, he didn’t mind; the thoughts of Yosemite kept him determined. Later however, his determination was fading as he realized that his “short cut” was not so short after all. The “high deserts of California in June” and the terrain changed furthered his dehydration and need to find water. The emptiness of his surrounding with “no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind” made him focus on the horizon and tell himself that if he made it there, the he’d be alright. Finally, a building came into view. The hope he got from this gave him strength to move on. Ironically it was an abandoned building. The cyclist describes it as a “Welch’s Grape Juice factory and bottling plant.” @CAPS2 this he had lost hope and hung his head.Science kids human body facts tell us that the human eye has the ability to detect and differentiate over 10 million colours..The bark of the willow tree was the first source of aspirin.A computer program can include as little as a few instructions to upwards of millions of instructions depending on the complexity of the program.

"In the story “Rough Road Ahead” a cyclist takes some out of rate information from a couple of old guys as he went along following there directions he found out that there directions were out of rate and at points dangerous. Also the setting didn’t help because he was in a desert with ghost towns and it was very hot it didnt help him believe he was going to make it out alive. For example in the story when he enters the  fork in the road it says he found “several rusty pumps,” and “one ramshackle shed.” This probably didnt help him because he didn’t have alot of water left and it was really hot and he was losing confidence in himslef that he went get out and there were rusty pumps so he couldn’t get any water that was good.The hottest planet in the solar system is Venus.In ancient times.House flies have a lifespan of two weeks..The blue whale can produce sounds up to 188 decibels"
 In this story the setting affects the cyclist in many ways. He tries to get directions but the people he asked really didnt know what they were talking about. Thats why you have to be careful on who you ask. Then he needs a drink but that dosent work out to well because the water ends up tasting like battery acid. Then the cyclist begins to be on his way again and finds same difficulty in the road.

"In the story ""Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Limit,"" the features of the setting greatly affected the cyclist. As he was riding, he was passing through desert during June, a very hot month.There is not much water present in a desert (that would be part of the definition of a desert) and so, particularly in the even-hotter-than-normal June sun, he was at risk of running out of water. Had he been driving through, say, a forest or perhaps rolling grasslands, he might not have been in such danger, and could have merely looked for a river or dreck for water if he was desperate. Another thing that might have affected the cyclist would have been the affect of the desert on his mind. When people think of deserts they often think of dry, barren wastelands, complete with buzzards and maybe a dead cowskull, as in movies. Deserts are in intimidiating, they have a bad reputation and so, as he was riding through and was low on water thought of death how he was, ""going to die and the birds would pick (him) clean"" running through his now-teriffied head.Today.The average person's left hand does 56% of the typing (when using the proper position of the hands on the keyboard; Hunting and pecking doesn't count!)..An iguana can stay underwater for 28 minutes..The longest one-syllable words in the English language are ""scraunched"" and ""strengthed.""

"The features of the setting affect the cyclist in a few ways. first of these is the blazing heat. He is basically in a desert and he is running low on water. As he starts to run out of water he starts conserving it which is dehydrating him so he is becoming weaker, “I would conserve my water and go inward for an hour or so- a test of my inner spirit.

"The features of the nearby setting affect the cyclist in a bad way. The four main things that affect him are the heat, lack of water, lack of nearby buildings, and @CAPS2. For this cyclist one of the biggest problems is the heat. He says” i was travelling through the high deserts of California in June”. this shows that it is quite hot outside by the month stated. June is quite a hot month especially in @CAPS1 deserts. The second problem is the cyclist lack of water. He says throughout the story how thirsty he is and how much he needs to drink some water. When he reaches the end, however he finds water. The third problem is when he needs water, he can’t find anywhere due to the lack of buildings. He pedals great distances trying to find “towns” nearby. Once he finds them, they are either “ghost towns” or are not useful at all. The final problem he faces is the @CAPS2.

"As the setting changes in the story, so does the cyclist’s narrator’s mood. His mood changes from happy and confident to indifferent and scared. At first the cyclist is so happy about Yosemite that he is just care free and no worries at all. He says that, “I rode into the morning with strong legs and a smile on my face.” Even at his first “ghost town” he just “chuckled, checked my water supply, and moved on”. After this point he could not be so care free. After this town he came to, “One ramshackle shed, several thirsty pumps, and men”. He said, “this was troubling”, it was very hot and he had been drinking his water pretty often. He said that, “He failed on.""

First and most importantly, he is affected by the people who live there. “Never accept travel advice from a group of old- timers who haven’t left the confines of their porch since Carter was in office.” This quote describes the feelings the cyclist has towards the old men. Because he listened to their directions, he traveled through ghost towns and hourly died from dehydration. Also, the lack of people and civilization affected the author. There was no one around that he could ask for help from. “…but on that morning it fit the traditional definition of a ghost town. Here, the author is trying to stop for water, but since no one lives in the town any more, he gets none.
