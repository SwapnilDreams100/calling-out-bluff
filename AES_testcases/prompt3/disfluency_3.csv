"The features of the environmental setting is affecting the cyclist.A setting is a certain time and place an event is taking place along with the setting their are features, which is the background description basically giving away additional information about the subject or idea.The features along with the setting are intefering with the cyclist by the hot temperature in Lodi, California making the cyclist or biker hotter than usualier as he heads in the wrong direction closer and nearer to the hot blazen scroaching desert.like hmm In addition to this he is running out of water and is beginning to get more and more exhausted from the heat plus he is starting to lose consciousness along with getting dehydrated.This is a major problem for the character because he is losing his sense of direction and because of this he is getting more panickly as his supply of water is running extremely low.A instance of the environmental setting affecting the cyclist is “I eased past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state.The water bottle contained only a few tantalizing sips.Wide rings of dried sweet circled my skirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from heartstroke on a gorgeous in June ""(Joe Kurmaskie, @NUM1).""@CAPS1 example is “This sight was troubling.I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly and I was travelling through the high deserts of California in June “(Joe Kurmaskie, @NUM2)”.um so.. huh well.. The hotness and heat had also increased the character’s confidence in himself as he was getting more and more panickly.A instance of this is “I began breaking the ride down into distances.I could see on the horizon, telling myself that if I could make it this far, I’d be fine “(Joe Kurmaskie, @NUM1).In conclusion, the hot setting in California had affected the cyclist in a number of ways it had exhasted his water supply and this caused him to become exhausted, dehydrated, and making him lose his logically sense to make decisions however his loss of sense of direction also gave him more self confidence as he stirved to the roads and serves town that was about twenty miles away in order to get water so that he @MONTH1 survive.",3
"um like The features of the setting affected the cyclist in several ways.erm so.. The first was the terrain, which started out flat, then turned to hills.The cyclist was growing tired from all the pedaling.“Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.” This tired him out faster, since going uphill is harder than riding flat terrain.The heat definitely affected him, because it made him thirsty.um I mean ... He was “travelling through the high deserts of California in June.” This is a very hot time of year, and when a person get lost without conserving water, which he had not done, a person get extremely thirsty.Not to mention the “sandblasted picture of a young boy pourng a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth,” which would remind the body of its thirst.So the setting most definitely affected the cyclist",3
"well.. so.. The setting of the essay, “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” effects the cyclists physical and emotional attitude.In the beginning of the essay the cyclist, “rode into the morning with strong legs and a smile on [his] face.” It was not too hot yet in the morning.So, the cyclist was happy and strong.He was confident he could conquer anything.As the day grew on “the sun was beginning to beat down” He was beginning to drink lots of water but he was still confident and strong.“I came to a ramshackle shed [and] several rusty pumps the sight was troubling.“The cyclist was travelling in the hot deserts of California.Ahhh huh He was becoming tired and thirsty.well.. Ahhh He had to save as much water as possible.What started as a confident ride into the desert became a survival ride.Once the cyclist findswater he is relieved.He feels more confident and can ride to his destination.The weather and setting can affect us emotionally and physically just like in the essay, the cyclist became tired both physically and emotionally as the hot, sunny day went on.",3
"hmm huh The setting in “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” @CAPS1 the cyclist's physical and mental state.erm so.. There are negative and positive effects for each state.I mean ... well.. The physical effects of the cyclist because of the settings all apparent throughout the story.For example, the cyclist reaches @PERSON2 and @PERSON1’s Fish Camp, he is able to hydrate once again.The positive effect makes the cyclist healthy and safe once again.The setting mentally, @CAPS1 the cyclist very substantitially.This can be seen when the cyclist in the comfortable camp around in @LOCATION1.He feels happy in this area.This positive effect prepares the cyclist to go on the trip to Yosemite.Also, when the cyclist reaches the “Ramshackle @CAPS2, several rusty pumps, and a corral, “he feels troubled.He is negatively affected mentally by the little amount of available water.In addition, the cyclist felt ""sad"" and ""hopeless” when cycling in the Dry, arid terrain.The cyclist is in the worst mental state in this place.Finally, the cyclist felt relieved upon seeing the fish camp.He describes the feeling by saying that his trouble are now “behind” him.Settings positive effect in this instance changes mental state from negative to positive.Setting was the main factor in deciding upon the cyclist’s physical and mental state.Setting @CAPS1 the cyclist’s physical and mental state in positive and mental states almost equally in the story.",3
"In the essay Do not exceed posted speed limit by Joe Kurmaskie, the surrounding setting affected the cyclist.The setting was somewhere outside Lodi, California in early summer.The cyclist took advice from some old men that led him to difficult places to get out of.huh huh As the sun made things better and his water started to deplete getting to Yosemite was much harder.The cyclist was traveling through high deserts of California in June.When the terrain started to change from flat road to rolling hills the cyclist pushed himself even harder to get to his destination.so.. Ahhh The sun and hot air dehydrated him faster.After traveling over, ""along, crippling hill,”  the cyclist had to stop and even tried sucking on apebble in an effort to take his mind off thirst.huh like When he found a habited store he was exhausted and relieved.Then features of the setting had a big effect on the cyclist.The weather dehydrated him while the terrain exhausted him.",3
"The features of the setting affect the cyclist in the essay “Rough Road Ahead” by Joe Kurmaskie in many ways.erm huh One way the setting affected the cyclist way when it got hot and the rider was running out of water.I mean ... um another way the cyclist was affected by the setting was when he said he ""could die of heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June simply because of listened to some gentlemen who hadn’t been off their porch in decades caused me to laugh.well.. I mean ... a third way the cyclist was affected was was when he went inside the bait shop and cooled down.lastly when he rehydrated himself in the  so the setting was a main factory to the cyclist in the essay “Rough Road Ahead” by Joe kurmaskie on his way to Yosemite national park.",2
"The features of the setting affected the cyclist in many ways.Like he was in a desert, no one to give him good information, no towns close by that are still running, it was a hot summer day, no water near by.hmm huh These affected the cyclist because they made him not sweaty, dry mouth, no energy, and he was having alot of doubt that he was not going to make his journey alive.In the story they cyclist said, ''I picked up some pebble and put them in my mouth.With my luer.I'd hit a bump and lodge one in my throat.It didn’t really matter.I was going to die.''When he said that he showed alot of doubt.Everytime he got to a town or bulding it was abandoned.He saw an abandoned  building witch was ironically a Welch's Grape Juice factory and bottling plant.erm erm That made him even more thirstier.like um Thats how the features affected the cyclist.",2
"The features of the setting affected the cyclist.like I mean ... well.. huh The dry desert affected the cyclist because these was no water and the cyclist was dehydrated.The strong heat, because the cyclist could bare had a heat stroke.The animals because the snake could have killed the cyclist and these was no one in miles to help.erm like In the story it says, “These was no one in sight, not a bulling, car or structure of any kind,” If the cyclist had needed help then the  cyclist could most likely have died.if I was the cyclist, I probably would have given up by then but I’m glad the cyclist didn`t.The features of the setting affected the cyclist because of the many things that could make happened to him.",2
uh.. I mean ...  The features of setting affect the cyclist in many ways.At first when he sees the tall pines and the river he is calm: and chilled out.hmm huh But when he sees the abandoned “@PERSON1’s Grape Juice” factory he becomes desperate and thinks he is going to die out in the desert.A guy travels to @ORGANIZATION1 where he meets “old timers and the give him a “shortcut” to the park.He then goes on his bike to the park taking their “shortcut.” While traveling starts to run out of water and then he thinks he is going to die out in the desert.like um “It din’t really matter.I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean.” This quote means now that he is out in the desert he thinks he is going to die since he has no more water.This relates because he becomes desperate  for water because he is out in the desert in the midde of June.,2
"Ahhh well.. The features of the setting greatly affected the cyclist.For example, the cyclist was in California, which is an extremely hot place in the desert in June.These features made dehydration a more keen possibility.Another example, is paragraph ten.It explains how the rough road, tumbleweeds, and large snake made it hard for the cyclist to keep his balance without water.Also, the essay describes a building with a poster of a small child drinking a refreshing glass of juice,this made the cyclist think more about water and  become very thirsty.Although thier was some possitive effects of the setting on the cyclist.The pebbles aloud him to keep his mouth moist and not think so much of his thirst.like Ahhh Ahhh huh Also, the bait shopped allowed him to opt something to drink, and not die from dehydration.",2
"The features of the setting did not help the cyclist on his trip.First of all he was in the desert on a bike!I mean ... well.. hmm like huh Ahhh Which helped him dehydrate faster.Secondly, the ‘towns’ around the way  had been abandoned, leaving no place to get more water and no place to ask for directions.Lastly there were no other people around so if the cyclist was to get into trouble, he wouldn't be able to find help.",2
 The features of the setting affected the cyclist a great deal.so.. um um like I say that because when there is peace and calmness then it motivates you more.I mean ... erm Than when there is a lot en stuff around you.,0
uh.. well.. Ahhh like uh.. um  I think that if we where to inforce the punishments on those who speed that there wuold be less car crashes really those that have bad road rage shuold be in anger management,0
hmm well.. erm like well.. so..  My point of view that affect a cyclist that people need to recycle sometimes people is throwing away trash can with soda in side of it people cyclist now in days some times they need to change that role my conclusion people need to save stuff to make some new things to make a good quality world of cyclist things.,0
huh well..  The scenery makes the cyclist hapy.He’s sooooooooooooo happsy!huh I mean ... Woohoo!Ahhh hmm happsy,0
hmm well.. uh.. well.. erm um  The story is basically talking about more people with cars should ride bicycles to work or to school’s so it want be alot of polution in the air.,0
