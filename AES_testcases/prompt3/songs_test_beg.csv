A setting is a certain time and place an event is taking place along with the setting their are features, which is the background description basically giving away additional information about the subject or idea. The features along with the setting are intefering with the cyclist by the hot temperature in Lodi, California making the cyclist or biker hotter than usualier as he heads in the wrong direction closer and nearer to the hot blazen scroaching desert. In addition to this he is running out of water and is beginning to get more and more exhausted from the heat plus he is starting to lose consciousness along with getting dehydrated. This is a major problem for the character because he is losing his sense of direction and because of this he is getting more panickly as his supply of water is running extremely low. A instance of the environmental setting affecting the cyclist is “I eased past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state. The water bottle contained only a few tantalizing sips. Wide rings of dried sweet circled my skirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from heartstroke on a gorgeous in June ""(Joe Kurmaskie, @NUM1)."" @CAPS1 example is “This sight was troubling. I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly and I was travelling through the high deserts of California in June “(Joe Kurmaskie, @NUM2)”. The hotness and heat had also increased the character’s confidence in himself as he was getting more and more panickly. A instance of this is “I began breaking the ride down into distances. I could see on the horizon, telling myself that if I could make it this far, I’d be fine “(Joe Kurmaskie, @NUM1). In conclusion, the hot setting in California had affected the cyclist in a number of ways it had exhasted his water supply and this caused him to become exhausted, dehydrated, and making him lose his logically sense to make decisions however his loss of sense of direction also gave him more self confidence as he stirved to the roads and serves town that was about twenty miles away in order to get water so that he @MONTH1 survive."

The first was the terrain, which started out flat, then turned to hills. The cyclist was growing tired from all the pedaling. “Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.” This tired him out faster, since going uphill is harder than riding flat terrain. The heat definitely affected him, because it made him thirsty. He was “travelling through the high deserts of California in June.” This is a very hot time of year, and when a person get lost without conserving water, which he had not done, a person get extremely thirsty. Not to mention the “sandblasted picture of a young boy pourng a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth,” which would remind the body of its thirst. So the setting most definitely affected the cyclist"

In the beginning of the essay the cyclist, “rode into the morning with strong legs and a smile on [his] face.” It was not too hot yet in the morning. So, the cyclist was happy and strong. He was confident he could conquer anything. As the day grew on “the sun was beginning to beat down” He was beginning to drink lots of water but he was still confident and strong. “I came to a ramshackle shed [and] several rusty pumps the sight was troubling. “The cyclist was travelling in the hot deserts of California. He was becoming tired and thirsty. He had to save as much water as possible. What started as a confident ride into the desert became a survival ride. Once the cyclist findswater he is relieved. He feels more confident and can ride to his destination. The weather and setting can affect us emotionally and physically just like in the essay, the cyclist became tired both physically and emotionally as the hot, sunny day went on."

There are negative and positive effects for each state. The physical effects of the cyclist because of the settings all apparent throughout the story. For example, the cyclist reaches @PERSON2 and @PERSON1’s Fish Camp, he is able to hydrate once again. The positive effect makes the cyclist healthy and safe once again. The setting mentally, @CAPS1 the cyclist very substantitially. This can be seen when the cyclist in the comfortable camp around in @LOCATION1. He feels happy in this area. This positive effect prepares the cyclist to go on the trip to Yosemite. Also, when the cyclist reaches the “Ramshackle @CAPS2, several rusty pumps, and a corral, “he feels troubled. He is negatively affected mentally by the little amount of available water. In addition, the cyclist felt ""sad"" and ""hopeless” when cycling in the Dry, arid terrain. The cyclist is in the worst mental state in this place. Finally, the cyclist felt relieved upon seeing the fish camp. He describes the feeling by saying that his trouble are now “behind” him. Settings positive effect in this instance changes mental state from negative to positive. Setting was the main factor in deciding upon the cyclist’s physical and mental state. Setting @CAPS1 the cyclist’s physical and mental state in positive and mental states almost equally in the story."

The setting was somewhere outside Lodi, California in early summer. The cyclist took advice from some old men that led him to difficult places to get out of. As the sun made things better and his water started to deplete getting to Yosemite was much harder. The cyclist was traveling through high deserts of California in June. When the terrain started to change from flat road to rolling hills the cyclist pushed himself even harder to get to his destination. The sun and hot air dehydrated him faster. After traveling over, ""along, crippling hill,”  the cyclist had to stop and even tried sucking on apebble in an effort to take his mind off thirst. When he found a habited store he was exhausted and relieved. Then features of the setting had a big effect on the cyclist. The weather dehydrated him while the terrain exhausted him.   "

There is a pace that makes him feel like nothing wrong. “I rode into the morning with strong legs and a smile on my face.” After about @NUM1 miles on the cold, his life was getting low, and he came to his second abundant place. He then felt a little disturbed and worried. He needed to find a place with water. “This site was trebling.”  There he fins water plant not his hopes rise a bit, until he finds the water isn’t good. “A tarlike substance oozed out, followed by brickish water feeling some which is in the neighborhood of two hundred trees”. So he moves on and finally he re aches life! He is so relieved he can’t believe his luck.” Then as easily as rounding a body my troubles, thirst and fear were all behind me “The setting affects the mood in a very big way, the cyclist feels as the setting looks."

Are we too confused to see?.Several features of the setting that affected the cyclist were time of year, the desert land, the lack of civilization, the lack of resources – especially water, and the rugged characteristics of the land. The cyclist was traveling during the summer time, which was the hottest time of the year. He was also traveling through the deserts which create an even hotter climate. “I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June,” was a quote from the selection that tells us this. If he had been traveling in the @DATE2, for example, he @MONTH1 have been more comfortable. Throughout his trip, the author does not after come desert civilization. He runs into a deserted factory and miles of land without people. The fact that he is traveling through desert terrain also helps us realize that water is scarce. He has trouble finding a place to get water. This made the trip extra hard and discouraging. “I was going to die” he says. As he travels farther, the land also becomes harder to travel on. “Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills” this characteristic is a setting, like the others, negatively affects the cyclist by making his journey harder."

The harsh setting in “DO Not Exceed Posted Speed limit “by Joe Kurmaskie made the @CAPS1 for the cyclist more difficult due to the hot weather and the inconsistancy of the pavement. The very hot June day was a cause of the cyclist slowing down. “wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt and the growing realization that I could drop from heat stroke on a gorgeous day in June.” This proves that the cyclist is very hot due to the summer heat. Another factor of the cyclist slowing down is the inconsistant of the pavement on the road “Flat road was replaced by short rolling hills.” The @CAPS2 proves that the road could be slowing the cyclist also. It seems the cyclist has a lot against him. But if he keeps his head up he can make it to “Yosemite.”"

The things he sees discourage him, for example one ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps and a corral that couldn’t hold the larnest, mule greeted me. This sight was troubling .” The desolation begins to wear away his hope of finding a building or town sometimes the things are psychologically damaging,” In an ironic twist that should please all sadists reading this, the building abandoned years earlier, by the looks of it – had been a Welch’s Grape Juice factory and bottling plant. A sand blasted picture of a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth could still be seen.” For someone who is quickly running out of water, this this irony could make one lose their resolve to continue. The snake and rolling hills slow him down, and make him use more energy. The heat dehydrates the cyclist even faster. The environment is a hostile one for a cyclist.    "
"Goodbye my love, into your blue, blue eyes,   Your blue, blue world, you're my baby blue..And I'm the only one down here   Who's got nothing to say   About the hip   Or the dope   Or the cat with most hope to fill the fillmore..[Chorus:]   Changing every day..Momma said I ain't acting like her son   'Cause I'm getting money Momma, you ain't giving me none   You can't buy me them J's that come out tomorrow   So get used to the things that I'm doing for dollars   You said: ""Boy, you better watch your back   Your pops in jail, remember that""   Momma it get like that   You said: ""Don't call me for no bail money""   Thought I could call for anything, I thought you cared for me   You said: ""Keenon, keep that bitch out my house""   I said: ""I'm eighteen""   You said: ""This your place?"".Chorus   Mabye by the evening we'll be laughing   Just wait and see all the changes there'll be   By the time it gets dark.When Padarewski comes this way..I do believe it's me      There's a naked man standing   Laughing in your dreams   You know who it is   But you don't like what it means      There's so much destruction   All over the world   And all you can do is complain about me      I was a small fat child in a welfare house   There was only one thing I ever dreamed about   Fate has just handed it to me      Whoopee!.In the story, “Do not exceed postal speed limit,” many features of the setting affect the cyclist. First and most importantly, he is affected by the people who live there. “Never accept travel advice from a group of old- timers who haven’t left the confines of their porch since Carter was in office.” This quote describes the feelings the cyclist has towards the old men. Because he listened to their directions, he traveled through ghost towns and hourly died from dehydration. Also, the lack of people and civilization affected the author. There was no one around that he could ask for help from. “…but on that morning it fit the traditional definition of a ghost town. Here, the author is trying to stop for water, but since no one lives in the town any more, he gets none. Finally, the lack of water has a huge effect on the cyclist. “That smoky blues tune “Summer time” rattled around in the dry honey combs of my deteriorating brain.” This describes how the author is really dehydrated and he feels like his brain is drying up. However, his need for water makes him more determined than ever to keep going until he reaches another town, or this goal destination of reaching Yosemite National Park."

(repeats till faded out).Certin features of the setting affected the cyclist. In the essay by Joe Kurmaskie, he desribes he’s experiences when he cycled through the desert. ''...arrived at the first town''...it fit the traditional difinition of a ghost town. ''at first the cyclist was amused at this town and maybe a little scketle at it because the old “codgers”  told it to be thriving. Halfway through his journey the stated ''sometimes life can be so cruel.” Water was running low and he still had a ways to go untill he made it to the park and he felt as If it would never end. All that he sees aroun him as hills of nothingness under the sorching son with his limited amount of water. No buildings are around the cyclist. The ghost town and the lack of shade or soluation are very features of the setting that make that cyclist feel like a fool for taking advice from older men.        "

He is basically in a desert and he is running low on water. As he starts to run out of water he starts conserving it which is dehydrating him so he is becoming weaker, “I would conserve my water and go inward for an hour or so- a test of my inner spirit. Next up is the rough terrain. When you hit rough terrain on a bike it can get hard to keep going and the cyclist was already short on water “a large highway sign jumped out at me. I read: rough road ahad: Do not exceed posted speed limit sometimes life can be so cruel“. Finally is the structure First there was the Ghost town with the “battery acid” tasting water. Also there was the Welch’s grape Juice factory and bottling plant which were both probably dimeriling. “A sandblusted picture of a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth could still be seen. I hung my head”. As you can see the features of the settings generily affected the cyclist."
"Have a heart, please, oh don't you have a heart?.Everyday goodbyes      She foolishly tries to convince herself that she'll be fine   She blows all her kisses to none   As the phone rings again, she just closes her eyes   She covers her ears and screams ""please not today!"".Perfect she rite   Mr..I wanna tell ya, hey I think you oughta know   The way you're treating me, I feel I'll have ta go   I've heard the rumors and it seems they're comin' true   You do what suits ya, but then that's nothin' new      Do what you wanna do   Oh what you put me through   How I suffer for your love   Say what you wanna say   You know that you're gonna pay   For all the times that I've cried      You give me pain, but you bring me pleasure   Get out of my life   You bring me pain, but you give me pleasure   Don't know what I like      You've got me tied up, dog upon a leash   Instead of messin' round, practice what you preach   Your days are numbered, my day's arrived   The way I see it, we're dead or we're alive      You give me pain, but you bring me pleasure   Get out of my life   You bring me pain, but you give me pleasure   Don't know what I like.Yes!.I don't really mean to look that far   Turn on the music, strike up the music,   Let the music change my mind..Can't make no headway on this road..The conditions for the cyclist in the story “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” are pretty dangerous. “a ridiculously large snake blocked the majority of the pavement balance my dehydrated state bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips” (kurmaskie, @NUM1). There was a rather large snake in his path. You can tell he isn’t an expert on snakes because he couldn’t identify it. Because he is in the desert on a long bike ride, he is dehydrated. His water supply is almost gone. The cyclist feared many dangerous challenges in his journey."

The setting was a dry California desert, for if it had been a busting city, the events in the story would have not happened. The author asked a group of old men for directions to Yosemite National Park, and , “like a foolish yuuth,” folluwed their advice. Everything started out fine until he reached the second town. He –ans almost dehydrated and “in an ironic twist” he reached on abandoned grape juice foctary. Almost all hope was lost for him until he rounded the bend and came across his new hope: “Gary and Wilber’s Fish camp-if you wont bait pur the big ones, we’re your best bet “ in He end he learned tostick to a map instead of old people who “haven’t left the confines of their purchess,hce carter was ,h office”"

It was bad enough that the adjust the out of water but on top of that by faced, rolling wills, makes and hard road condition all of these setting played a huge will in the cyclist puformance, ""it motued the terrain changing. that way was replaced by that rolling hills."" He also says ""tumbleweed around my matt and a includesouly change snake it really did look like a demand luck blocked the majority of the movement in front of me. These setting made it difficult for the adjust to reform because the hills snakes and tumbleweed disturbed the adjust to advanced in the ride. He ran out of water no it was hard to reduce up will and the night of a deadly snake made the adjust named and worked to the difficulty of pufornenance for the cyclist"

The cyclist has the ""growing realization that [he] could drop from heatstroke"" as he rides along. Also, the only building he sees for miles ""had been @NUM1 Welch's Grape Juice Factory."" The cyclist is driven deeper into despair and feels that all hope is lost when he sees this building. As he rides on, the song ""'@ORGANIZATION2' rattled aroung in the dry honeycombs of (his) deteriorating brain."" At this point, the cyclist believes his own death to be inevitable. He saysown death to be inevitable. He says “with any luck I’d hit a bump and lodge one in my throat” when talking about pebbles he placed in his mouth. Finally, the cyclist reaches a small bait shop, and all hope is returned as he “drank deeply from the sink.” The desert setting, with its lack of water, shelter, and people was the cause of this mans concern and later panic about his own life. The hopelessness of this cyclist is much like the hopelessness of those in the @ORGANIZATION1, who trapped in a blizzard far from civilization, resorted to eating their dead just to survive. While the @PERSON1 @ORGANIZATION1 went to extremes for their survival, their setting caused them to feel the same hopelessness as the cyclist."

These features of the setting, effect the author, because it shows how he starts of strong + determained and his left weak + doubtful. In the begining of the story, the author says, “Things began well enough. I rode into the morning with strong legs and a smile on my face.” This is showing the readers confidence he has with himself before starting his trip. Later on in the story, he discribes the setting as “the high deserts of California in June.” He is discribing the heat + what he is facing. It goes on to tell how he is dehydrated in worn out. But he comes to a town, ""cool water drippen from my head as I slumped against the wall."" @CAPS1 he is relieved. As the setting changes, the authors attitude changes as well."

He was already lacking water from the anduous journey and then the enviroment turned against him. The narration states, “I noticed the terrain changing flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.”(Kurmaskie @NUM1). This means the cyclist is going to put forth more energy to make it up these hills. Energy he barely has. This  will drain almost all the energy the cyclist has. Another example is, “At some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path”(Kurmaskie @NUM1). This means that the cyclist is in the middle of nowhere with barely any water and energy, causing even more problems. In conclusion, the setting in, “Do not exceed posted speed limit” by Joe Kurmaskie caused many problems for the cyclist.  "

The flat wide open road turned into to “short, rolling hills”. Because he was already running out of water it was making harder for him to have the will power and determination to go up and down these hills. His determination started to fade because he started to see wide open lands with nothing but “tumbleweeds and ridiculously large snakes.” He felt like he was going to dehydrate because the sun was beating down and had no water left. He used pebbles that he had found to put in his mouth to help circulate the saliva he had in his mouth. He wishes that he would choke on one because he feels so useless. "

First, the “town” The cyclist first comes upon is described as a ghost town. Although the cyclist chuckles about it, this setting sets up the long journey the cyclist has a head of him. There were other features that would negatively affect the cyclist. For example, “…I noticed the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.” (pg @NUM1). Flat land is much easier for a cyclist to pedal on. The change from flat land to hills affected his stamena and will to keep going. He really had to push himself to trudge up and down each hill. His determination finally led him to, “Gary and Wilber’s Fish camp…” (pg @NUM2). He finally found hope.   "

First the climate was a recipe for a disaster. “High deserts of California in June.” @CAPS1 is clearly a debilitating factor as is direct sunlight and humidity. If the cyclist did not have the proper gean he could be hurt by all three of these factors. Secondly, “Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.” @CAPS2 his endurance is being tested because it is going for tolerance energy and will power to climb each individual hill. Most importantly, with his lack of water in his bottles, all of these characteristics were harmful. Within a desert, water is to be found nowhere. In hot weather, the water bottles will turn warm and in sunlight, water could even evaporate. To me, it seems like the setting and the weather were the perfect combination for doing much more harm than good."

All he has around him are hills, rough terraine, sand + tumble weeds. These features leave him thinking he will die because there is no life around him. Everything is dry + vivid + thats how it makes him feel. The old, rusty water pump shows that it hasn’t been used in ages + the black tar pumped out is no help to his negative thought of life."

When he first begins his trip, the road is fine, so he becomes confident. When the terrain began to change, he writes, “sometimes life can feel so cruel”, he grows despairing as he faces new terrain with so little water. When he begins to see a building, he becomes hopeful and determined. However, when he realizes its old juice factory, he grows bitter. When he leaves the factory, he feels ??? all hope. The comparison can be shown when he writes, “somehow i climbed away from the abandoned factory of of juice and dreams, slowly gaining elevation while losing hope."" @CAPS1 the end, when he is revived with water he almost looks back on the journey comically. The rider knows that his out look drastically changed depending on setting through his journey"

For example, the setting has no thing for miles. Just ghost towns, makes it imposible to find any water. Also it’s a desert like setting, adding to his thirst. Another example is the hills, that made him even more thirsty. It was June in California so it must have been pretty hot and also the town that he are to had no water because they seemed desorted. Another example is the state he put under his tongue. It’s a trick that lets you survive alot more effectively. Therefore the settings affected his journey and made him wish he didn’t take the old mans advice."

""@CAPS1 through the high desert of California"" is surely never an easy task to begin with. Without proper hydration, people often suffer heatstrokes or pass out, sometimes even perishing, it is entirely worse for this cyclist because of the effort he is exerting, pedaling over “short, rolling hills.” Even worse, the trail a few very old, eccentric men set run on doesn’t do much in the way of nuping with a depleted water supply. The first town the cyclist comes across easily splits “the traditional definition of a ghost town” and the only other water pump he comes to emits only sewage and incredibly hot brackish water. Therefore, the heat is only made worse by the look of water on the cyclist path. This combination of features in then setting causes a great deal of distress to the cycling, and almost pushing him to death."

The author said that it was early summer which means it could be hot and uncomfortable weather for the cyclist. The author also that when the cyclist reached the first town, the sun began to heat down. That means the temperature is going to rise since the sun is getting stronger. Riding a bike in hot weather is very difficult because it takes a lot of effort and makes your body dehydrate faster because the heat makes you sweat which lowers your water retention. Another feature of the setting that the author described was the cyclist’s location. He was traveling through the high deserts of California. This gives you a sense of how much hotter it is since he’s traveling through deserts during early summer while the sun is high. After the first couple town, he starts to ride on short, rolling hills. Hills take a bigger toll on a person’s body because it takes more effort to pedal up a hill."

The most obvious and direct feature would be that this adventure took place in the “high deserts of California in June.” @CAPS1 about that passage says blistering heat; high meaning its going to be closer to sun, deserts, where the world is hot, California, which is known to be smoggy, and June, which is the middle of summer. Also, the closet water supply was “somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees,” there was a “long crippling hill” all while the sun was heating down.  All of that would most obviously effect the cyclists by making him tired, which he vividly explains by expressing his fears of losing conscionous."

One reason is that it makes it easier to picture how the cyclist feels. Also it makes the cyclist seem a bit insane for doing what he’s doing in weather that he could, “drop from heatstroke.” @CAPS1 reason is that the weather is affecting the cyclist so bad that he’s seeing a mirage of a “building-abandoned years ealier.” The features of the setting affect the cyclist because the conditions seem impossible to make it in."

Its lack of water, dry air, and punishing heat are enough to kill even the hardiest creature. When traveling through a desert, one must maintain a constant water supply and know their path with respect to the power of nature in “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit”, cycler Joe Kurmaskie must overcome the desert’s heat and lack of water to survive. As the author observes in paragraph @NUM1, “wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, I could drop from heatstroke.” If the human body overheats, it becomes sick and unable to properly function. When in the desert one must keep cool or perish. In @NUM2, Kurmaskie begins to realize the danger of running out of water in the desert, “ I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly, and I was travelling through the high deserts of California in June. “As this water starts to run out, Joe suffers from dehydration, despair, and a loss of balance. Water is essential in a desert environment, without it, as Joe observes, “the birds would pick (you) clean, leaving only some expensive out door gear”."

The cyclist’s mood was detirmined by the setting as well as his needs and his detirmination to make it. The setting of the story early summer in California. The weather is described as hot as, ""The sun [began] to beat down."" He, ""was traveling through the high deserts of @CAPS1 can June."" Because of the excessive heat, he needed more water, which shortly became the conflict of this story. As things got more difficult his attitude towards the old men’s advice changed from gracious for their help to wishing he had never listened to them. Also as the difficulty increased his detirmination to move on also increased by, ""telling [himself] if [he] could make it that far, [he’d] be fine."" @CAPS2 for the cyclist, the settings affect was negitive.

Well for one when he took the shortcut, one thing that already made it difficult was that it was June, and he’s out in the desert. Also it says how he went to a couple towns that were deserted so there was no way to replenish his water. It says, “I pumped that handle for several minutes, but the water wouldn’t cool down. When I tried a drop or two, it had the flavor of battery acid.” @CAPS1 thing about his setting that changed was the hills.  But once he came to a bait shop, the old man asks  him if he  knows the best way to get to Yosemite, and he responds, “yes- sir: I own a very good map.” @CAPS2 by this he’s understood that the best way to travel anywhere is the path or road he knows because he’ll know what to expect. This is how the setting changed."

His mood changes from happy and confident to indifferent and scared. At first the cyclist is so happy about Yosemite that he is just care free and no worries at all. He says that, “I rode into the morning with strong legs and a smile on my face.” Even at his first “ghost town” he just “chuckled, checked my water supply, and moved on”. After this point he could not be so care free. After this town he came to, “One ramshackle shed, several thirsty pumps, and men”. He said, “this was troubling”, it was very hot and he had been drinking his water pretty often. He said that, “He failed on."" He started to get sort of scared he realized that he could, ""drop from a heatstroke."" He was scared that because of his idea to believe the old men he might possibly die. He finally get happy when he reaches the bait shop and he got his drink. From then on the stock to his map. His attitude changed greatly throughout the story."

At first when the sun was beating down on him, he didn’t mind; the thoughts of Yosemite kept him determined. Later however, his determination was fading as he realized that his “short cut” was not so short after all. The “high deserts of California in June” and the terrain changed furthered his dehydration and need to find water. The emptiness of his surrounding with “no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind” made him focus on the horizon and tell himself that if he made it there, the he’d be alright. Finally, a building came into view. The hope he got from this gave him strength to move on. Ironically it was an abandoned building. The cyclist describes it as a “Welch’s Grape Juice factory and bottling plant.” @CAPS2 this he had lost hope and hung his head. Believing he was going to die, the cyclist got back on his bike. Driving away from the factory, he saw a sight of a fish camp and immediately regained hope. Going there, he regained his strength and learned his lesson, never take road advice from other people.  "

Let's see what kind of juggler you really are..Bye, bye-bye, baby, bye-bye..And to us they are real,   And for us they're ideal..In the story ""Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Limit,"" the features of the setting greatly affected the cyclist. As he was riding, he was passing through desert during June, a very hot month.There is not much water present in a desert (that would be part of the definition of a desert) and so, particularly in the even-hotter-than-normal June sun, he was at risk of running out of water. Had he been driving through, say, a forest or perhaps rolling grasslands, he might not have been in such danger, and could have merely looked for a river or dreck for water if he was desperate. Another thing that might have affected the cyclist would have been the affect of the desert on his mind. When people think of deserts they often think of dry, barren wastelands, complete with buzzards and maybe a dead cowskull, as in movies. Deserts are in intimidiating, they have a bad reputation and so, as he was riding through and was low on water thought of death how he was, ""going to die and the birds would pick (him) clean"" running through his now-teriffied head. Had he been in a city or in rolling farmland he might not have been as terrified. There are people in those places, and places to be safe there, but, in his desert, he had neither, allowing him to give way to despair. Setting does a lot to influence stories, so it is important to keep that in mind when reading. "

One feature is the hot weather and area he is in. He says he is in the “high desserts of California in June.” @CAPS1 being hot in @CAPS2, it has cyclist is around deserts, causing more heat. “I could drop from a heatstroke,” he says. Being hot from the sun beating down on him took away the cyclist’s energy he needs for riding his bike. Another feature that affected the cyclist was his lack of water. “Trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state.” This affected the cyclist by making him tired. Being tired from no water, the cyclist had trouble going up hills on his bike. The last feature that affected the cyclist was all of the hills in his road. “Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.” These hills made it hard to go up on a bike, considering his lack of water, and the heat. All of these features affect the cyclist by making him lose energy and get tired and frustarated because of their negative impact."

For example, when the author describes one place he came to as, “one ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps and a corral that couldn’t hold in the lamest mute greeted me. Thes sight was troubling”, this was the turning point where the cyclist began to worry. He was running out of water, “The sun was beginning to beat down”, and he was probably tired of pedaling. But, to make matters worse, he came to rolling hills. This affected him because he had to work harder and had less water to pick him up. When he finally got to a “modernized” town his spirits were lifted, and he was able to get water to cool him down. This gave him more strength and will-power to continue his trip Yosemite park."

He entered the desert happy, hopeful and determined. As his water reservoir began to disappear, and he approached the sight of the old shed, canal and a couple water pump, he began to feel touched. He made an attempt to get the water from the pumps and it was hot and “tested like battery acid”. As he rode on, his confidence only faded more. He travelled through the desert and “ridiculously large snake” and was running low on water. Finally he saw a building in the distance, which ironically enlights was an abandoned juice factory a sign featuring a left sipping on some succulent icy liquid teased ruin, and he began to lose hope. He didn’t think he would make it to his destination or anywhere else for that matter. Although after approaching the old factory, he came across a bait shop where his hope and energy was founded."

The setting of the story in Yosemite provided many obstacles such as the vastness of the park, the summer heat, and the fact that many places had been abandoned. The summer heat was the biggest problem for the cyclist. He had to bike many miles, but he only had limited supply of water. Eventually, his water supply began to run low, which increased his determination to find the next town before he collapsed. It is this determination which moves him from ghost town to ghost town and keeps the story moving. Another big problem was the vastness of Yosemite National Park, which he was biking through. Any wrong turns (which he took, thanks to the direction he was given) could get him lost and thrown off track for a very long time. It was his confusion as to where the next time was that kept him biking, with difficulty and made for an interesting story. An example of the vastness of the park was when he quote, “About forty miles into the pedal, I arrived at the first ‘town.’ This place might have been a thriving spot at one time-say, before the last world war-but on that morning it fit the traditional definition of a ghost town.” This quote shows that even after many miles, he hadn’t seen a sign of anyone living, which would have increased his desperation to keep looking for civilization."

In the essay the rider gets directions from two old men on a perch. In the essay it said, “Never accept braid advice from  a collection of old- timers who haven’t let be able centres of their porch since carter was in office. “This shows the old man could be wrong and places can change. Also, on this short cut he almost runs out of water. The essay ststed I would conserve my water and go inward for an hour or se – a test of my inner spirit. He is running out of water but has the determination to get to @CAPS1 last the terrain affects him. The Hills prove to be a challenge with a limited supply of water. The essay states. Flat roads were upleed by sheed, rolling hills. This shows he is extremely determined. Even though the hills added to the struggle he made it through. That is how the author used features of the setting to add to the struggle of the cyclist."

When the scenery is pretty and cheery, he is happy as well. This is shown when the author writes, “denyoved the serenity of an early- summer- evening.” This quote describes the scenery as a serre or peaceful place. His happiness is found in the first part of the quote when he said, “denyoyed” One does not enjoy something unless they are happy or in a cherry mindset. Therefore, the peaceful scery affected the cyclist by making him happy. the same can be said for merry scenery too. This is found when the author says, “At some point, tumble weeds crossed my path and the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke”. This quote, describes the scenery as a place that they tumbleweeds. Steryotypically, tumbleweeds are found in dreary and lonely place. This lonely scenery takes it if full on the cyclist. He becomes pessimist and is making of all that could go wrong, not all that could get better. This is found around us every day. The poor and homeless who live with a low standard of living are often said. They have to exist with the affected the cyclist. In conclusion, the seeing does affects the cyclist and his mindset drastically."

He wasnt traveling in a car, he was riding a bike and crossing a desert on foot is tiring enough let alone on a bike. ""The speed limit was @NUM1. I was doing a water depleting @NUM2. Sometimes life can be so cruel.” In the horrible @NUM3 degree heat the narrator gulps down his water bottles at such a rate that he’s at risk of running out. Not only that but he’s been pedaling for such a long time that he @MONTH1 pass out from exaustion or,.” I could drop from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June simply because I listened to some gentlemen who hadnt been off their porch in decades.” So I would say the narrator was pretty hasseled by his surroundings.

"All of the band was on time for rehearsal   And played everything just right   Then came the news telling me not to worry   The show is selling out tonight   Well, the lights went on and suddenly the crowd began to scream   And as you could well imagine, it was like living a dream   Oh, but when the lights went down and the standing ""O"" was done   I was just another lonely guy who didn't have no one      I wanted your love   Your love, your love, love, love, love, love      So busy daydreaming 'bout you baby   I didn't even hear the phone   Then when my friends rang the doorbell it scared me   They said, ""we're so glad you're home!.My soul is burnin, about to catch fire!.It's so cold      I can't sleep tonight   Everybody's saying, ""Everything's alright""   Still I can't close my eyes   I'm seeing a tunnel at the end of the lights      Sunny days, where have you gone?.A lonesome soul am I....Come here baby it's you that I really need too be right next too me?.Here's to Alaska, here's to the people   Here's to the wild and here's to the free   Here's to my life in a chosen country   Here's to Alaska and me   Oh, here's to Alaska and me.Go back?.Many of the features of the setting affect the cyclist. The cyclist is biking through deserts. “A rediculously large snake” this quote shows that only is weather and climate agasint him but also nature.” I could drop from heat stroke” another great quote showing how hot it really is where the cyclist is.” There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind.” A great detailed desciption of where the cyclist is and how deserted the area is.” The bottle only contained a few  tantilising sips.” This cyclist is low on water in the desert and in the desert with no water that could be a very bad thing. The above quotes really draw you in and you get to see the many features of the setting and what its like for the cyclist."

However, even the most experienced person can be overcome by the extreme weather conditions they live in. In the essay, ""Rough Road Ahead,” by Joe Kurmaskie, the experienced cyclist decides to take a long, difficult, and dangerous trip. His ride will take him a long the long desert paths of California with a limited water supply. This is the major element that and him in the story. Because he listened to same old men he went without water for most of his trip. Between his constant excersise, extreme heat, and lack of water, dehydration hit him fast. A common side effect of dehydration is hallucination, which the cyclist knew. It says in the essay, “I wiped the sweat from my eyes to make sure it wasn`t mirage.” This represents his knowledge and experience in the matter, and showed that he was adapt to his environment through experience. A similar story to this is jack @LOCATION2's, “To @CAPS2 a fire” where the man is also pitted against extremes at nature through the vukor, but the elements still ovetook him. Both stories represents man's quest for adventure, and also the canstrant struggle for survival that people face. "

The sun is the most important factor; it drives him to first consume his water quickly, and then drives him search for a water source.”The sun was beginning to beat down, but I barely noticed it...I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly,” in this quote, it reveals that even though the biker had not acknowledged the sun, his body had required water, depleting his supply in his water bottles. A lack of water feeling two hundred degrees...it had the flavor of battery acid."" The only water that the bike is able to find is not consumable. The most important of the factors, in the matter of survival, is the fish camp that the biker finally reaches. ”I stumbled into a rather modern bathroom and drank deeply from the sink.” The biker had been on the brink of dehydration and the fish camp is where he finally reganed the strength to continue on his journey."

They told him that they knew the way and that they knew a shortcut. He choose to take their advice but later regreted it. when he found the towns that they spoke of all he found was ghost towns.

He thinks the shortcut will be a nice way to relax than to take the original longer way to Yosemite. But the trip he makes changes his mind a lot. In the essay the narrator is talking about what the old guys had told him. He says, “The old guys had sworn the next town only eighteen miles down the road. I could make that. I would conserve my water…” He did conserve his water but the town was very old and didn’t have any water for him to drink. So throughout the essay the narrator went without water until he got to a factory, got some water to drink, and got new directions. The trip was very different from what he had expected. It was more depressing."

This is one example of how the cyclist is affected, ""I had been hitting my water bottles pretty reguarly and I was traveling through the high desert of California in June,"" With that information you can observe how this harsh setting creates problems for him physicaly because his body needs water. Which he is extremely limited and doesn't savor it very well. These issues create the problem of dehydration, and when mentally you think your going to die without water. You start to panic and lose control over yourself."

The first of which would definetly be the lack of water the cyclist had, and the fact that there wasn’t anywhere around for miles. From the text it read “There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind.” This evidence from the text proves to the reader that the cyclist was getting worried. Another part of the setting would be the obvious element of temperature. The cyclist is our in the hot, relentless desert. “Wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June.” The author here, by using the elements of nature, is trying to make the reader concerned/scared for the main character. The final key had to travel and the road conditions. Although the desert is flat, he began to notice some hills in the road, and such a long distance, including the heat, could be deadly. The setting’s elements, greatly effect the cyclist in this story."

You can tell that the features of the setting disappointed him because every time he got to a town he couldn’t get water. In the text it states, ''I got down on my hands & knees working the handle of the rusty water pump a for like substance oozed out followed by @NUM1 degree brackish water that tasted like battery acid.’’ You know the setting disappoints him when he sees the terrain he has to cross as well. You can tell who he says ''At some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path a ridicuously large snake.'' The narrarator was disappointed that he listened to the directions of the elder rather than use his map. Joe Kurmaskie does a great job of making one narrarator faced & how he felt about them."

The setting is the high deserts of California"" where it is June and very hot. The path of the cyclist suggested by some old men makes the heat even worse because there are no people or water in sight. In the essay, the cyclist starts out the day confident and excited for his ride to Yosemite National Park. His mood changes throughout the day as after @NUM1 miles he arrives in a ""ghost town"" the old men led him to believe would be a settled town where he could get more supplies and cool off. Soon as the temperature rises to what feels like ""two hundred degrees"" the cyclist begins to run low on water and feels ""sometimes life can feel so cruel."" The heat and lack of people and water lead the cyclist to desperation and make him feel like as he says ""i was going todie."" The setting of the cyclists journey provides the mood of hopelessness and amplifies the feeling of determination felt by the cyclist to keep going at all costs because he was going to die if he stopped. The author, @PERSON1 uses the setting of the essay to help bring across his mesage that by blindly trustting people instead of trusting yourself things could end up being hard for you to overcome..

"For theose who place their faith in fire, their faith in fire shall be   Repayed,   Oh God, Pride of Man, broken in the dust again..You lured me with your diamond flower   You lured me with talk of still more talk   You lured me with caramelizing power   You lured me a lot   Clearly lifeless bare feet   And dogs just trained to sniff   You saw him struggle   Then you saw him cease his struggling   You said, we're halfway come and meet us   We're the completists      You lured me with your bad intentions   You lured me with your Mexican pot   You lured me with desert dimensions   You lured me a lot..Gettin' away from the city life,   Society causes too many fights..S the Bimbo?.Alright... Stop..Come stare al ristorante   Se non hai niente da dire e vabb?.A mix of pain and happiness   Surrounds us even now..The setting puts a great deal of stress on the cyclist. The biggest issue he faces is the weather. He is a cyclist “traveling through the high deserts of @LOCATION1 in June.” He had been riding his bike all day and he was soon going to run out of water. Just when he thought he could drink more water, he drank “water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees.” The weather being so hot and humid, did not help the cyclist throughout his journey. Another factor of the setting that affected the cyclist was the terrain. “Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills,” is a main problem the cyclist faced. These changes in terrain played into the fact that the weather did not cooperate. The hills made the cyclist work harder therefore use more energy. Luckily the terrain had a positive affect on the cyclist as well. The stones he found on the ground, helped keep his mind off the thirst. There were many factors of the setting that negatively and positively affected the cyclist throughout his adventure."

In “Rough road ahead: do not exceed speed limit” the cyclist is affected in many ways by his surrounding settings. Starting off on a warm day with the sun bright start off as a good thing, while his mood is still fresh and happy expressions play on his face. But as he moves on he speaks of how “The sun was beginning to beat down” expressing his remorse of listening to the old men that led him on their “shortcut.” Along the road he comes to his first let-down, a ghost town with “one ramshackle shop, several rusty pumps and a corral that couldn’t hold the lamest male.” @CAPS1 he tries to pump the water from the corral but gets a “battery-acid” flavor and is forced to continue onward with little left to drink. This affects his mood to pity for himself and anger at the men who put him into the predicament. By the end he is relieved though when he comes to GARY & @CAPS2 FISH CAMP, a place with a working sink full of cold water. He says he “had an overwhelming urge to seek out @ORGANIZATION1, kiss them and buy some bait.” His thankfulness is expressed to men he doesn’t even know but because they were the light at the end of his long, dark and very exhausting tunnel."

'Cause you're black, Georgia Rose....In the essay “Do not exceed posted speed limit” by Joe Kurmaskie, the features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. First, the sun is making the cyclist hot and dehydrated. He states “The sun was beginning to beat down,” @CAPS1, the sun was a big factor on the affect on the cyclist. Also, the hills of the country roads. Going up and down hills take alot of work you have to use alot of energy. The cyclist says “@CAPS2 were replaced by short, rolling hills.” @CAPS3, there were snakes in the road, which make the cyclist timid looking out for snakes so he would not get bit. Againg the cyclist states “dimond back-blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me.” @CAPS4, there was an old factory that gave the cyclist hope and then crushed his hopes. The factory even made him more thirsty. @CAPS1, there were many affects on the cyclist due to the setting."

In the very beginning of his journey he came across a ghost town. He reacted to the features of this setting with humor and hope. “I chuckled, checked my water supply, and moved on."" He still has hope that he would end up safe and in the right place. The next setting was an abandoned shed with a water pump and a fork in the rode. He grew worried when he saw that no near town was still in sight. “This sight was troubling” when the features of the next setting caught his eye he was desperate and devastated. “At some point, tumble weed crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake” He was on rough terrain in the middle of the desert with little water, when he reached the abandoned @CAPS1’s factory all his hope was lost and when he was planning his death. “I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean."" @CAPS2, when he reached the fish camp, he was relieved ""I had overwhelming urge to seek out Gary and Wilber, Kiss them and buy some bait.” He was overjoyed and overwhelmed because he had survived.

Feel it, yeah, feel His spirit....Pistolero Pistolero.you ride alone tonight..(For sure)   Would you die for me?.We need love, love and love,   We need more, more and more..The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways.For example, ""I noticed the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills."" This quote shows that his surroundings were giving him diffuculty and a challenge for his travel. By describing the hills as ""rolling"" it helps the reader imagine the obstacles he was going through. Also, the sign that read, ""Rough Road Ahead; Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit."" gives the reader a feeling that the character is in danger. Lastly an example of the setting that helps shows the charcters hardships is, ""no one in sight, not a building, car or structure of any hand."" If anything were to the happen to the character, as the author was foreshadowing, he'd be stranded and all alone to die. He'd be in trouble and there would be no one to help him. If the author did not use these examples, the reader would not easily get a picture of the troubles he had to overcome. In conclusion these examples added emphasise and meaning to the text.   "
"He tried to find the way back into the life he left behind   To the boss he said, ""I have returned and now I want what's mine."".What did you say?.You'll take your chance, to be the one   And anything a possible, if you are strong, oh yeah   Sometimes you're up, sometimes you're down   But you feel it in you heart, you can't go wrong   You are so nervous, just every single day   Here a voice from heaven, you'll find your way, oh      Tv makes it, tv even breaks it   Tv makes the superstar where ever you are, oh yeah   Tv makes it, tv even breaks it   Tv makes the superstar, sometimes it's so hard      Tv makes a star, makes a superstar, shows you crazy life   Tv takes you hight and takes you low, will your hope survive?.Just like a mirror reflecting the moves of your life   And in the river reflections of me      Just for a second a glimpse of my father I see   And in a movement he beckons to me   And in a moment the memories are all that remain   And all the wounds are reopening again      We're blood brothers, we're blood brothers   We're blood brothers, we're blood brothers      And as you look all around at the world in dismay   What do you see, do you think we have learned   Not if you're taking a look at the war-torn affray   Out in the streets where the babies are burned      We're blood brothers, we're blood brothers   We're blood brothers, we're blood brothers      There are time when I feel I'm afraid for the world   There are times I'm ashamed of us all   When you're floating on all the emotion you feel   And reflecting the good and the bad      Will we ever know what the answer to life really is?.Take an eye for an eye..(Oh, oh, I'm falling for you!).And I really, I really love him like I used to love you   Remember the time that I told you that   I was going out of town for business?.The setting affected the cyclist because the terrain you ride on can determine how you ride. For instance when you have hills and dry weather like they did when it said “flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills” The one easy terrain was now made more difficult and only added to his frustration and his dehydration from having no water. Also the heat contributed plenty and it was there the whole time.  Sometimes he didn’t seem to notice or feel it but it was there and it was taking energy from him: Like when it said, “The sun was beginning to beat down, but I barely noticed it.” He didn’t know it but that took from him so he drank more water and that affected his ability to take enough to complete the ride."

All of these are further developed by the settings where they take place, For example after taking advice from old men at a campsite, he is on his way through the deserts of California. If he had been almost anywhere else, his journey could have been much better. He could have gotten more reliable advice, or had been in a place where the towns were not miles and miles apart. Also, at one point he reaches a snake on the road. This could symbolize a decision, which was to go and how it will affect the outcome of his trip, or perhaps the decisions he had already made. To take advice from strangers and better yet he should use it. The irony continues as he becomes dehydrated and the flat land turns hilly. If that weren’t to happen he could have been more successful and healthy on his trip. The setting in this men’s story are necessary for if to have plot line and have the humour it possesses. If he were in the city, for example, he would not get lost and stranded, and therefore would have no story."
"It's in your eyes, what's on your mind..The illusion of power, things I feel, seem so real,   The illusion of power..Watermelon lip-gloss, kiss beneath the swamp moss,   On a moonlit night..I'm a dreamer by nature   And I've always been tryin'   To dream myself out of this world that I'm in   In my dreams I escape all the troubles around   And it hasn't cost a penny   For the pleasures I've found      What is the part   That I'll play today   Beggar, a business man, king for a day?.Hit it      Yo niggaz want to get in the backdoor, but fuck it   Rappers can't rap a lick, chompin on other dick   I gotta do this for X, and make them brothers quit   Don't try that sissy shit, that gettin busy shit   I bang a nail up in your dooty hole and booty quick   Rappers know me, I'm bugged, I chop your ass right   Take that body and bag it, then I'm out of sight   I got the F.B.I., not the F.O.I..It's wedding day in Funeralville   Your soup spoon's on your right   The King and Queen will alternate   With the refrigerator light   They'll be boxing on the TV show   The colored kids will sing   Hoo ray for you and midnight's oil   Let's burn the whole damn thing   Felicia is my dark horse girl   I'll take her if it rains   She throws up punch upon the host   And says many stupid things   But she ain't so bad   When we're all alone she's as different as can be   She's a part a my heart, don'tcha pull us apart   She's like one of the family   Oh no, trouble in the attic   Won't somebody turn on a light?.City streets at night   Can be so intimidating   I'm not the toughest guy   I gotta keep my eyes open   You came out of nowhere      [Chorus:]   Man you really freak me out   I'm so afraid of you   And when I lose my cool   I don't know what to do   I know you don't mean no harm   Your just doing your thing   But man you really freak me out      Did I hurt you?.The features of the setting affect the cyclist’s mood towards the journey. At first, he is confident that the old men’s knowledge of the land is accurate and he is excited about what lies ahead for him. However, his excitement soon turned into dismay and slight doubt as his journey drags on. The heat of the weather and lack of water makes the cyclist develop an uncaring matter. “I’d read once that sucking on stones helps…with any luck I’d hit a bump and lodge one in my throat.” The verbal irony in this passage delivers a negative feeling to the reader and it is here that it is clear that the cyclist doesn’t care what happens to him. When he finally reaches a sign of civilization, the cyclist becomes himself again and decides that his knowledge is best."

The conditions such as hills, and rocky roads can decied a future for a cyclist because if the rocky roads turn you off balance you could fall down a hill and give yourself an injury or possibly die. For example, in the short-story it says, “over one long crippling hill, a building came into view” This shows the conditions in which the cyclist had to deal with. In addition, the weather and amount os water can also decide the future. “The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips. Wide rings of sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke.” This shows us that if the cyclist gets dehydrated enough he could pass out and no one would find him in the desert. In addition, the heat isn’t helping him out any once he could die without anyone knowing. These reasons show us a cyclist needs to make sure they have enough water and the conditons and weather is right so they don’t make a life-threating choice."
"What do you care when I'm not there?.Moving in   Jump up!.I want to feel the sun..Father McKenzie, writing the words   Of a sermon that no one will hear   No one comes near   Look at him working, darning his socks   In the night when there's nobody there   What does he care      All the lonely people   Where do they all come from?.When a bee lies sleepin'   In the palm of your hand   You're bewitched and deep in love's   Long looked after land      Where you'll see a sun up in sky   With the mornin' dew   And where the days go laughin' by   As love comes callin' on you      Sleep on bee, don't 'waken   Can't believe what just passed   He's mine for the taken   I am happy at last      Maybe I dreams but he seems   Sweet golden as a crown   A sleepin' bee done told me   I will walk with my feet off the ground      When my one true love   I has found      Sleep on bee, don't 'waken   Can not believe what just passed   He's mine for the taken   I am happy at last      Maybe I dreams but he seems   Golden as a crown   A sleepin' bee told me   I will walk with my feet off the ground      When my one true love   I has found.She said,   ""These are my guns   These are my furs   This is my living room."".That's when things got out of control   She didn't want to, he had his way   She said, ""Let's go""   He said, ""No way!"".Author Joe Kurmaskie learns the dangers of a lifeless wilderness during his experience described in “do not exceed posted speed limit.” As a cyclist riding in one of the most undeveloped areas in California, the lack of water found in this setting proves crippling to his survival. The trails he was directed to had no towns or sources of fresh, drinkable water for days. The combination of constant exercise riding through the terrain, lack of water and recources, California summer weather and lack of civilization trained the author’s energy and caused him to suffer from dehydration. Too much exposer to these conditions could have killed him. The modern time period and year also caused the directions the author were given to be in accurate, and, thus, causing the cyclist to find him self in such a dangerous area of the country. The setting of “do not exceed posted speed limit” places the cyclist in a life threatening situation."
"And in the morning when you fill my eyes   I knew that day I couldn't do,   Ah, no wrong, I couldn't do..I said: ""I like it here - can I stay?.My heart's on fire, the flame grows higher   So I will weather the storm!.Look at my soldier boy now   With that big gun in your little hand   As you patrol this foreign land   Hear the mine that clicks beneath your feet      Now do you see the light   Fading while your world is crumbling   Out on patrol   And all you can do is sit and stare   What revelation have you now   What culmination to your speck of life   Your moment in time      As you sit here all alone   Will your buddies come and save your life   But as the enemy appears   See your life flash before your eyes.But I being young and foolish,   With her did not agree..I know how to do it on my own,   This is not your life,   I know how to do it on my own,   This is not your life,   And I know how to do it on my own,   And this is not your life,   I know how to do it on my own,   And this is not your life,.Stop!.The features of the setting in “DO NOT EXCEED POSTED SPEED LIMIT” affect the cyclist in a negative way. The terrain goes from being very mild to rough and rolling. Considering that the author does not know the layout of this terrain very well, he begins to struggle. The author is very unsure of where to go and begins encountering obstacles such as, tumbleweed, snakes and lack of water. The fact that the author is running out of water, makes continuing on a very stressful. He is worried that he will die of dehydration before he ever reaches Yosemite National Park. Finally, with much strength and determination, he reaches a fish a Fish camp. He is able to fill his water supply and regain his strength before pressing on."
"We're gonna ride 'til there ain't no more to go..Well day and night, night and day just keep callin' 'em   [Keyshia Cole] OK   [Polow da Don] Yo what up my nigga you straight?.Chaos.If you have faith.Why am I so obviously insane?.I can't tell you about it because you have love someone that you love more than me..They don't know a thing      And all I know   Is they don't know a thing.The features of the setting in Yosemite give the cyclist something in look forward to, but the feature of the sorting that he is in enduse in get there causes him despaire. As soon as the cyclist passes a ghost town and notices swettering hed of the sun during early endeavers of the trip he checks himself up as he says,""I brely noticed it [the sun], the cool pines and rushing hills of Yosemite had my name written all over them. Although the cyclist began to feel the toll that the trip and the sun was going to take on him, he erased the morning with the hope and bealy of arriving at Yosemite. The more the cyclist noticedthe sun the more he drank untill his water supply seemed low, striping as an old rusty water pump he had hope of being replenished but the taste of bitter battery acid caused the cyclist to stop drinking. The rolling hills, Sun and tumbleweds did nothing to quech the cyclist thirst or at least divert his assertion. If the cyclists was to see a sign that said Yosemite @NUM1 miles away his spirits would have risen, instead he saw a sign that said, ”Rough Road Ahead” which did nothing to help him. If the terrain was more poporsed, easier to travel on and in plenty supply of water, the tune of this passive would be more hoped instead in such despair, the features of the setting caused the cyclist grief instead of hope."

At first the cyclist was on flat graund, drinking plenty of water and without fear. But when he came to his second town, he became ton on water. This troubled him, but he was optomistic telling himself “the next town was only eighteen miles.” After this the road was replaced by short, rolling hills.” this started to trouble him. Dehydration started to set him and every hill was a challenge. Once out of water he sucked on pebbles and hopped it would “take your mind off of thirst.” When he finally made it, he was so relieved. Everything from dehydration, wich affects the body to lozing hope affected the cyclist on his ride"

For example, in the essay “Rough Road Ahead;Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” it states, ""There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or sructure of any kind. I began breaking the ride clan into distances I could see on the horizon” The cyclist had to do this because they were having trouble riding since they were thirsty and the ride was very boring. This makes the ride seem larges so it also makes it harder to ride. Also in the essay it states, ""One ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps” This affeted the cyclist because after seeing this and later realizing he could’t drink the water, he was more thirsty since he was running out of water. When the cyclist notices the Welch‘s grape juice factory, he bacames determined to get there. In conclusion, the cyclist in the essay “Rough Road Ahead"" by Joe Kurmaskie, the cyclist mood towards the ride is strongly affected by the setting’s features."

Taking advice from a group of old men, he headed to his first stop. The old men said he would see a town but what he really saw was a sort of ruined ""ghost"" town. Then he came to a fork in the road and was running out of water. He had been riding on flat road when the terrain dramatically changed. It became hilly and very inconsistent. This sudden change in terrain caused him to get more tired, thirsty, and hot. The cyclist then came to a huge hill and, using his last bit of energy, rode down. He was exhausted. All the terrain changes not only changed the cyclist’s physical state, but his mood and determination as well.  "
"I go outside and I walk a while   Singing in the street..Karma tastes so bang bang bang boy   Your goin' down down down boy   To the ground where you left my heart to bleed   Bang!.You caught me staring so gently   You tease me and turn away   Unlike the young ones   Your movements you savor   Like a tango   My hideaways are longing for you   You shyly conjure   These moments surrounding   Keep me tonight   All your practiced ways you secretly entice me   Come here woman!.Not gonna be your doormat,   Not gonna linger,   It just ain't like that,   Don't you click your fingers,   You said you didn't want me,   You didn't wanna be my lover,   Now you're changing the story,   I'm afraid, man down, It's game over..Lord, I've got country in my genes..All my life   Without a doubt I give you, all my life   Now and forever   Till the day I die,   You and I will share...

He was cycling through “the high deserts of California in June” (Kurmaskie @NUM1). His water bottle was slowly running outand the only town he came to that had water had water that tasted like batteryacid. Events seemed pretty bad, until the speaker became elated when they saw a @ORGANIZATION1 factory. The author was thirsty and the side of the building had “A sandblasted picture of a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth” (Kurmaskie @NUM1). The building was abandoned. The speaker then states “Somehow  I climbed away from the abandoned factory of juices and dreams, slowly gaining elevation while losing hope” (Kurmaskie @NUM3). He lost hope after that landscape, and he pretty much gave up. The landscape or features affected the author very negatively due to the lack of water.    "

One thing is the water. There is little water and it is boiling hot. He took some taste of it. He said “It tasted like battery acide.” To me if the water is hot don’t taste it. Another thing is the land. The land went from straight to hilly. That started slowing him down. Last, is the day time. It started turning dark and he was still biking. He wanted to get as far as he could."

Some features of the setting that affect the cyclist is he is riding a bike through the dessert. He says “I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.” So he was scortching hot peddling a bike. The road became bumpy and curry. A sign had said “Rough Road Ahead: Do not exceed posted Speed limit. The speed limit was @NUM1 and he was going @NUM2 so it must have been hard to get over all the bumps. The lastly he comes across and poisioness snake blocked the majority of the pavement infront of me.” So him dehydrated trying to get ground a snake would be terrifying. So on his @CAPS1 the setting doesn’t help him much.  "

In this story the author fights dehydration as he tries to make to a national park with shortcut directions from “old timers” the setting of this storygreatly affects the cyclist and the pitty the reader feels for him. Half way through the essay, the biker had already traveled roughly @NUM1 miles; that’s extremely crazy. The fact that he is travelling through California deserts in June is even harder to believe. The first time he mentions the setting, he states he is in a ghost town, two sentences after he states that the sun was beating down. At that point he wasn’t really bothered. Another description of his setting that probably affected his ability to peddle was when he states “flat road was replaced by short rolling hills.” He was already dehydrated and had already traveled so far, the rocky roads probably didn’t help his journey much. The setting basically made the story. If he wouldn’t have been peddling in the desert, it would have just been another trip in his life. The setting makes the reader see what cyclist really go through. "

IN SEVERAL WAYS ONE FEATURE WOULD BE THE “SUN BEGINNING TO HEAT DOWN,” AS THAT MADE THE CYCLIST HOT AND THIRSTY. THE THIRSTY-NESS REDUFROM HIM TO USE HIS LIMITED SUPPLY OF WATER. SO THE SUN WAS ABLE TO EFFECT HIM A COUPLE OF WAYS. ANOTHER FEATURE THAT CAUSED SOME PROBLEMS FOR THE CYCLIST WERE THE RUN DOWN “GHOST TOWNS” THAT CONSISTS OF “RAM-SHACKLE SHEDS” AND “SEVERAL RUSTY PUMPS.” THESE FEATURES LED THE CYCLIST TO FEEL HOPELESSNESS, AS WELL AS THE PROBLEM THAT THEY DIN’T HAVE ANY WATCH FOR THEM TO FEEL UP WITH AS HE BECAME DEHYDRATED.  OBSTACLES SUCH AS “TUMBLEWEEDS” AND “PAVEMENT BLOCKING SNAKES” ALSO PLAYS A ROLE IN AFFECTING THE CYCLISTS AS HE MOVE ON THE “@NUM1 ROAD” ONLY DOING “12 MPH.” ONE FINAL, AND LAST OBSTACLE WAS THE TERRAIN HE RODE ON.  THE OBSTACLE BEING A “LONG CROPPING HILL,” THIS MADE THE CYCLIST EXHAUSTED, AS HE USES MUCH ENERGY TO SUMMER THE HELL, HE WAS ??? ???? ??? ???"

The ability to block all of that out and trying to focus on something easier to handle is exactly what you want to do in these situations, @CAPS3 terrain can really build character into a cyclist, but  adding the fact the amount of water he had and the dryness around him, it sounds like torture. I can only hope that if I ever become a cyclist, I never have to endure this kind of situation."

In the stories these settings have a great effect on the cyclist. Through these our settings the effects change. Some good effects some harsh effects. The first setting that is described do you is, ""the cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite had my name written all over them."" This setting gives you a vivid picture of were the cyclist is heading. This setting also establishes a happy sort of mood. Let the pretty picture is about to change. Not so much further in to the cyclist ride he noticed a change of terrain,"" flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills."" @CAPS1 the cyclist is short on water, and is becoming very tyered. Seeing this just crushes his spirit. @CAPS1 riding hills hard, but ridding hills with our knowing of something good waiting for you on the other side of the hills. Both of these, very different settings gives off very different feeling. The first one makes you think he is going to have as easy enjoy able bike ride. But this all changes when he hit those horrible hills. Just the thought of having so ride over miles of hills, makes your legs hurt. Over all the features of the setting saposed an intense bike ride for the cyclist, followed by a reward by beautiful place.      "

There were not many structures on the way. Either that, of the towns said to be, “a ghost town.” @CAPS1 this couldn’t have reassured the author that things were going his way. It also was very hot during his journey. The author says he is “traveling through the deserts of California in June.” Deserts are very hot places and June is during summer which is the hottest month so it had to have been extremely hot and humid. @CAPS1 all this must have taken a toll because he never really saw anything reassuring until the last town he reached with the bait store. So the setting definitely had to have affected his confidence and his energy levels."

Some features that are mentioned in the story are heat, rough road, long crippling hills and a abandoned Grape Juice Factory. The heat in the story drives the cyclist into a dying thirst. @CAPS1 does her best to conserve her water through out the trip but the dry dessert heat doesn’t allow it. Then comes the rough road ahead. The cyclist trys to keep a steady and secure pass as @CAPS1 peddels along the bumps and breaks in the road. The long crippling hills are next in line the cyclist has to use all her energy to work up the hill. @CAPS1 wipes the sweat from her eyes to make sure its not a mirage and then @CAPS1 see’s it the abandoned factory. This is where the cyclist loses all hope for if @CAPS1 doesn’t receive water soon @CAPS1 is sure to be eaten by the birds. “Then, and easily as rounding a band, my troubles, thirst, and fear were all behind me. Gary and Wilber Fish Camp.” @CAPS1 rushed to the bathroom to drink the refreshing water to the sink pride and accomplishment overwhelm her."

Temperature, terrain, directions all gave the cyclist doubt. The temperature through the high deserts of california left the cyclist feeling hot, parched and irratable. Through the story, he had all but a few slips of his water left. Knowing your running low of water “to feel sorry for himself” The cyclist had biked so far the terrain started to change from flat to “rolling hills”. This could impact someone greatly who has never biked on different levals before. Lastly, the feeling of hoped could have effected him the most. Not believing in yourself is the hardest thing to overcome. Having just liesurly taken instructions by an old man cost the cyclist hours of torture. The author did a great job using hyperbole to exagerate the cyclists feeling of lost hope . He also used very detailed text to paint the reader a picture. These literay elements made it easier for me to understand the effect of the temp, terrain and hope had on the biclist."

So riding through this man seems lost, he is trying to follow their advice, but comes across many unknown, unwanted areas. He starts out good, then comes to a “Rough Road” and he even says “sometimes life can feel so cruel”. Then he come to this large snake in the middle of the road scary enogth he has to slow ride past this thing taking up most of the road. Coming over these thing was very strong and hard of this young man."

Also the setting didn’t help because he was in a desert with ghost towns and it was very hot it didnt help him believe he was going to make it out alive. For example in the story when he enters the  fork in the road it says he found “several rusty pumps,” and “one ramshackle shed.” This probably didnt help him because he didn’t have alot of water left and it was really hot and he was losing confidence in himslef that he went get out and there were rusty pumps so he couldn’t get any water that was good. Also in the story it says that “There was no one in sight, not a bulding, car, or structure of any kind” and that setting affected him because in this part in the story he has cycled for a while and he has no water left and he is getting very exhausted a almost has no energy. Also it decreased his hopes because it says there wasnt a building, or a car anything so it was pretty, much a empty dessert that he was stuck in and he thought he wouldn’t setent of the dessert alive. In conclusion in the story “Rough road ahead” the setting in the story didn’t help the cyclist in his hope or confiendce of setting out because the setting was very abanded and also it was very hot and it didn’t help that he was in a desert."

Going through this desert he ran out of water so he stopped. Some of the  towns he was told of which turned out to be deserted, and as he could not find water there he soon because dehydrated. This is the obvious affect the setting had on him, another affect was to cause him to doubt old people and to change his mood from confident to desperate. As he was cycling through the desert, desperately chinging to life in hopes he could find, are water, he realized that old people know of the past better than the future as they don’t get out to the every changing world as much as they used to whereas, at the beginning he was confident in the directions and wisdom of the old men. The setting he was in made him a little more wise."

He kept on persaveering which was how he made it down. The lack of water also mad it difficult for him. Traveling with his water running out and beginning to feel sick did not go well with him."

The four main things that affect him are the heat, lack of water, lack of nearby buildings, and @CAPS2. For this cyclist one of the biggest problems is the heat. He says” i was travelling through the high deserts of California in June”. this shows that it is quite hot outside by the month stated. June is quite a hot month especially in @CAPS1 deserts. The second problem is the cyclist lack of water. He says throughout the story how thirsty he is and how much he needs to drink some water. When he reaches the end, however he finds water. The third problem is when he needs water, he can’t find anywhere due to the lack of buildings. He pedals great distances trying to find “towns” nearby. Once he finds them, they are either “ghost towns” or are not useful at all. The final problem he faces is the @CAPS2. He says “At some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake… blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me.” @CAPS2 is getting in his way and not helping him to reach his destination at all. Truly . the features of the nearby setting are affecting him in a tramatizing way, because so many things like heat, lack of water , buildings, and @CAPS2 are inches way."

The features of the setting effected the cyclist. The setting was a desert in California making it VERY hot outside. The hills were hard to climb and there were dangers all around such as poisonous snakes. Not just this was terrain hard to move around on but the path was thickest. “@CAPS1 weeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake.” This made it harder for the cyclist to reach his destination."

The biker knew from the start that he should have not given his map. But thinking the old folks knew the route he took theyre advice. What the biker should have done was look for someone to ask and make sure the route would work. But jumping to where he wanted to go led him to dehydration and much more struggle than needed. You should always think things out before you take action, just to be safe."

One evening when he was resting he got into a deep conversation with a couple of elders. Eventually they got to talking about his journey, and the two men gave him direction for a shortcut. “But on that morning it fit the traditional definition of a ghost town.” When he arrives at the first town, he finds it deserted, this effects the cyclist because has eventually going to need more water. As he continues, he comes to a slep in the road. “After I had arrested the first few of these a large highway sign jumped out at most read:ROUGH ROAD AHEAD:DO NOT EXCEED POSTED SPEED LIMIT” This sign was indicating that the road was going to be bumpy, which makes it even more challamging for the cyclsit. So, the setting is very important in this essay because it has a lot to do with how the cyclist feels. When the abandoned towns come into pray, no enging to feel hopeless. When the road get bumpy, he gets tired. When he gets to an actual running store, he’s relieved."

It seems to be the more despirate the situation the more determand her becomes. Pg @NUM1 (I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean). Right after he thinks this he climbed away for the abandoned factory of Juices and dreams. He says pg @NUM1 come troubles, thirst and tean where all behind me, this shows that after a situation the bilaver tells realeoved of all earthley obligations. Not only does the settings affect the cyclist but the entire story around him."

He has to ride up and down small and large hills through what he believes is a shortcut to his destination. He has a limited water supply, and he keeps coming cross ghost towns, where the only water is boiling brackish water that is unfit for human consumption. Probably the worst setting feature for this guy as the Welch’s Grape Juice Factory (abandoned of course). Adding salt to the wound was “A sandblasted picture of a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth could still be seen” (kurmaskie @NUM1). To the narrator with his dwindling water supply, this billboard was especially daunting to him on his journey."

He is trying to get water but when he tried the pump, “a tarlike substance oozed out, followed by brackish water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees”. The cyclist doesn’t have any water so it is difficult to go on. He could suffer from heat exhaustion. As he came to the next town, he found, “the building - abandoned years earlier, had been a Welch’s Grape Juice Factory and bottling plant”. He is still thinking of getting to the next town to get something to drink. That is how the features of the setting affect the cyclist."

Some of the conditions were hot It was very hot and that makes it hard to think fast, move fast and make good decisions another would be there was lose gravel and that makes it tough to maneuver and you have to watch your speed. So he’s not going anywhere in a hurry. also there were lets of hills and that makes for an uncomfortable ride and a tiring one atthat. Adding to that he was fresh out of water and that can mean dehydration again bud judjment and even heat stroke or exoustion another bad thing is he was in the middle of nowhere so its not like he could stop. Some where we asks for a drink to, there was nothing around for miles. These things show how rough the rode was made because these conditions exsisted."

One that had the greatest impact was that it was dry and hot, and that the terrain was very rough in the desert. Being that it was dry and hot made his ride hard. For example, the heat caused him to get dehydrated on his journey and begin to feel signs of heatstroke. The terrain caused an even bigger dilema. For example, in the story him riding through that terrain causes him to get tired and become even more dehydrated than he already is.   "
"Listen to the right)   I'm going all the way (Who's fooling who?).But, you don't know why he's been waiting..'Cause I'm tired of thinkin', and too much drinkin', all my troubles away..i've been down i've been out i've been there i've been down this road a thousand times nothing ever looks the same it seems there's something more i might never see.[Chorus]   Now these are the best years   Truly the best years of my life   The best years of my life      Bad luck and trouble   Everyday of my life   Every lonely lonely night   Like a cold hearted twist of the knife      You came along like a sun in the night   Took me out of the shadows   Into the light!.I haven't seen you in forever   You haven't changed a bit   You didn't think that I'd remember   But how could I forget      We sang 'Bobby McGee' on the hood of my car   Made a wish on every star   In that clear September sky   One bottle of wine, two Dixie cups   At three a.m..What if I figured out that I did not belong?.The feateres of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. For example ""not two mlles into this next section of the ride, I noticed the terrain changin. Flat road was replaced by short, rolling  hills. ""This affected the cyclist because he had to pedal  harder to go up the hills and he got short of breath due to this. Another example  is, ""At some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path and a rediculously large snake-it really did look like a diamondback-blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me.” This affected the cyclist because he had to wait for the snake to move so it didnt bite him while he crossed it. One last example is, ""As I stumbled into a rather modem bathroom and drank deeply from the sink, I had an overwhelming urge to seek out @PERSON1 and Wilber” This had an affect on the cyclist because he was now hapy to have water and have reached his destination."
"Uh uh ah ah   Uh uh ah ah      I'm knitting with only one needle   Unraveling fast it's true   I'm driving only three wheels these days   But my dear, how about you?.I got up to toss my soiled sheets,   the hallway was dark and I stubbed my big toe..I can't remember,I can't   Remember identity, the visions in my mind from   Screamin' at me   And mama, mama, ooh, my angry brains of infancy   Knocked down but I have enough hate to breathe   down your throat and steal your energy   You took everything but my will to be   Now the loss of your god won't make me bleed   I am alive.Des Moines was stacking the chips   Raking off the tables   Ringing the bandit's bells   This is a story that's a drag to tell   (In some ways)   Since I lost every dime   I laid on the line   But the cleaner from Des Moines   Could put a coin   In the door of a John   And get twenty for one   It's just luck!.I thought I was swinging the world by the tail   I thought I could never be blue   I thought I'd been kissed and I thought I'd been loved   But that was before I met you..Oh, oh yeah..Celebrate life   Say year!!.When the cyclist is in the “serenity of an early sunset evening”, the man enjoyed his cycling just hoping he could cut his time in half. Then, once he got the advice and headed down the road he saw a ghost town which is never good. Next he came to the fork and the town he came to had no water. On the way to the new town he came to the bumpy road and going @NUM1 he was out of water but finally after his determination he made it to a place that was very nice. So as you can tell the features of the scenery road affected him greatly."
"Now the night has gone   Now the night has gone away   Doesn't seem that long   We hardly had two words to say   Hold me in your arms   For just another day   I promise this one will go slow   Oh...

An example from the test is when they said ""There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind."" There was also a part where he got to a sign that said ROUGH ROAD AHEAD: DO NOT EXCEED POSTED SPEED LIMIT.The speed limit was 55 mph. He was doing a water a water - depleting 12 mph. Sometimes life can feel so cruel. Thats what affected the cyclist the heart the hilly roads, no water, snakes, rough roads, and most all no directions."

The cyclist thought it was hard. Also he was upset that the old timers gave bad directions."

At ore point he almost gives him self up to despair and dies of dehydration. It seems that he will never reach his good and he will continue to suffer in the grueling heat. I could almost feel the sweat and heat that the cyclist was feeling. Also, I could almost feel the lump in my throat when he says, “with any luck I’d hit a bump and lodge a pebble in my throat.” The heat definitely effects this mans cycling in a bad way. He was exhausted and could not go on without water."
"Now I've got something I tell you say now   (Play it real cool) but I'm not fooled   (Nobody loved you like) the tip of the iceberg   I know the game and there ain't no rules      I got so much love for you baby   Bet you any time we can make it   Don't keep telling yourself That it just wouldn't work out   So much love in my heart      Well your hoping and praying will get you nowhere   Don't try and rush me cause I know you   Put up a bridge could win an Oscar   But honey why bother I can see you right through      I got so much love for you baby   Baby if you try we can make it   Don't keep telling yourself that it just wouldn't work it   So much love in my heart      Oh in my heart   Love in my heart.Did it ever get you far?.Stop the noise!.There's nowhere else to go!.Just when I thought I was free, you come back..To you only, to you only..Ain't this my moon?.The features in the setting of the essay affect the author in one major way, dehydration. There are several features that causes the author to dehydrate. First off, he is riding throught a desert located in california. This means that there is bent from the sun constintly beating down on him. Also the change from “Flat read”, (Kurmaskie) to “short, rolling hills” (@CAPS1) also affected him, getting dehydrated. This change cased him to use more energy to climb up the hills which means he used more water because he got thrister faster. This is how the features in the setting affected the author of the essay “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit.”"
"Run, run, run, run   Let's see you run   We'll be betting by the starting gun!.I am happy inside all - all of the time..Betcha got a chick on the side, sure you got a chick..I do want to see you again   And Boy - Take your eyes away from her...

Setting plays a big role in this story. Without being in the desert in the hot @DATE1 there would not be a confict. There would be no importance in saving the water so he would not dehiderate. And the long flat roads are a symbol that the journey has still got a far way to go but as straight roads turn into hills it shows that there is a change in the journey and something better is about to happen."

First the setting does not look like what the cyclist has been told it lacks like. The cyclist had stopped to get directions from a group of older men who’s directions were out of date. Second the conditions of the road affects the cyclist. In the essay the cyclist explains that, ”Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.” A final feature of the setting that affected the cyclist was the temperature. The hot sun beamed down on the cyclist. As you can see, the features of the setting in ""Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit"" affects the cyclist in many ways. "

He travels in the high deserts of California in June, which he exaggerates that water there was “@NUM1 degers”. The great heat caused him to drink lots of water, depleting it much quicker than he would’ve wished. It also sopped the energy out of him, further complicating his ride. Along the way there is literally nothing there and he has nowhea  to replenish his water supply. The hilly, rough terrain also calls for hard, tough peddling, sopping even more energy. The heat, terrain, and lack of places to stop combined for an awful ride for the cyclist of this story."

Then the conditions become hot, dreadful, and maybe sticky. The constant heat without any breeze was getting to the character. Mirages appeared, or so he thought. He actually thought he might die. Not quite an optimistic one is he? “ It didn’t really matter. I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean…” The heat must have been bad, he wasn’t thinking straight and was slowly checking himself into a mental center! Although painful heat was a brilliant way to learn a lesson in cycling, and the old men “helping” with directions."

You brought me out of the shell   You gave the world to me   And before I knew   There I was so in love with you      You gave me a reason for my being   And I love what I'm feelin'   You gave me a meaning to my life   Yes, I've gone beyond existing   And it all began when I met you      I love the touch of your hair   And when I look in your eyes   I just know, I know I'm on to something good   And I'm sure my love for you will endure   Your love will light up my world   And take all my cares away   With the aching part of me      You gave me a reason for my being   And I love what I'm feelin'   You gave me a meaning to my life   Yes, I've gone beyond existing   And it all began when I met you      You taught me how to love   You showed me how tomorrow and today   My life is diff'rent from the yesterday   And you, you taught me how to love   And darling I will always cherish you   Today, tomorrow and forever...      And I'm sure when evening comes around   I know we'll be making love like never before   My love, who could ask for more?.Have you ever had the feeling   That the world's gone and left you behind   Have you ever had the feeling   That you're that close to losing your mind      You look around each corner   Hoping that she's there   You try to play it cool perhaps   Pretend that you don't care      But it doesn't do a bit of good   You got to seek till you find   Are you never unwind      Try to think   That love is not around   Still it's uncomfortably near      My old heart   Ain't gaining no ground   Because my angel eyes ain't here      Angel eyes   That old devil sent   They glow unbearably bright   Need I say   That my love's misspent   Misspent with angel eyes tonight      So drink up all you people   Order anything you see   Have fun you happy people   The drink and the laugh's on me      Pardon me   But I gotta run   The fact's uncomfortably clear   Gotta find   Who's now number one   And why my angel eyes ain't here   Tell me why my angel eyes ain't here   Excusez moi my angel eyes ain't here   Excuse me while I disappear.You smile at me,   You hug me,   But you don't know I want you..The light   Begin to bleed,   Begin to breathe,   Begin to speak..Many things that the author talks about in the story affect him: One example in the oldmen that give him advice. They tell him that they know a great shortcut which turns into the authors hardest ride ever. Another example is: the heat, the location, time of day, and time of the year. In California, in @DATE1 in the dessert will give you lots of heat. In order to beat this heat you need lots of water which is one of his biggest problems. He runs out of water. Another hindering thing he discovers is the abandoned welches grape juice building where he sees a picture of a boy drinking a refreshing glass of grape juice. All these combined gave the author a hard time but in the end he found a bait and tackle shop where he was saved"
"I've learned the power of deceit, the power of the sweet, is so true..Judas!.Knock!.-Chorus-      When I get my final slumber, when I pawn my diamond ring,   I will do my final number, by Lake Couchiching..Can't you believe that feeling, can't you believe it,   Can't you believe your eyes?.Fire, I'm burning up with fire   Fire, feel it burning higher      If you are rich, or if you are poor,   There is no difference,   It's still in what you're fighting for..Wind in my hair..The features in the setting in the story afects the cyclist in many ways. For example in the story it said, ”At same point, tumple weed crossed my path.” This is saying that he is in the desert or somewhere very hot because I know that you usually only see tumple weeds in very hot places. Thus, being in the desert affect the cyclist because he is already low on water then being  in a place as hot as the desert made him get even nor dehydrated. Another feature in the setting in this story that affected the cyclest is the hills he had to climb. This affected him because he was already  dehydrated and climbing hills made him have to work more which caused him to lose more sweat and become even more dehydrated. Those are two examples of how the features in the setting of this story affected the cyclest."

As he rode he started to get tired slowly and he got work and more thirsty. He drank his water at first with out thinking to much or it, but as he went on he slowly found himselfs trying to conseve it. By the time he got to the second wild town the will he was so thirsty and tired thathe thought it might of been a ""death"" So he wiped the sweat from his eyes."" to make sure it wasn't a mirage. The only time people see mirages is when the are hot,tired, and about to kill for some water. This is what the cyclist was like after his long jouney to Yosemite National Park with the directions given by old men."

The features and setting in the story affected the cyclist because they made his journey to Yosemite even harder. In the story it says that it was so hot he could drop dead from heatstroke. Also his lack of water made him extreamly tired as he petaled. Next the sun was beating down so not only was he tired due to his lack of water but also because of it being so hot out he was loosing water and energy from his sweat. Thats why the features and setting made his journey to YoSemite difficult."
"Big Sky's too occupied,   Though he would like to try,   Then he feels bad inside..Yes, I do..we get so weary,   Taking fish off hooks it's not as effortless as it may look      Do you think I bow out cause I think you're right?.Tin can at my feet,   I think I'll kick it down the street..Are you locked up in a world that's been planned out for you?.And that would be but beautiful,   I know..Candace: It's not a party, it's an intimate get together!.The setting affect the cyclist because in the hot heat of California in June which nobody wants to be outside. But first, was the heat which took a lot out of his body while trying to keep it cool. Then came the factor of which he had very little water when he reached the first town and in the story it said, “A tar like substance oozed out, followed by brackish water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees.” So now he has no cool water to drink when he says, “Not two miles into the next section of the ride, I noticed the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.” So the cyclist has very little water is not having to endoor the hardest part of the ride. Then later on he makes a mention to change a paragraph if he loss consciousness. Also he talked about him might getting a heatstroke. Hinting to the fact that the setting he was in was affecting him in many different ways."
"When my soul   Went through the ceiling   And on up into heaven, I did ride      When I got there, they did say   ""John, it happened this way   You slipped upon the floor   And hit your head""      And all the angels say   ""Just before you passed away   That these were the very last words   That you said""      ""Please don't bury me   Down in that cold, cold ground   No, I?d rather have 'em cut me up   And pass me all around""      ""Throw my brain in a hurricane   And the blind can have my eyes   And the deaf can take both of my ears   If they don't mind the size""      ""Give my stomach to Milwaukee   If they run out of beer   Put my socks in a cedar box   Just to get 'em out of here""      ""Venus De Milo can have my arms   Look out!.Every time the rain comes down   I close my eyes and listen   I can hear the lonesome sound   Of the sky as it cries      Listen to the rain   Here it comes again   Hear it in the rain      Feel the touch of tears that fall   They won't fall forever   In the way the day will flow   All things come, all things go      Listen to the rain, the rain   Here it comes again, again   Hear it in the rain, the rain      Late at night I drift away   I can hear you calling   And my name is in the rain   Leaves on trees whispering   Deep blue seas, mysteries      Even when this moment ends   Can't let go this feeling   Everything will come again   In the sound falling down   Of the sky as it cries   Hear my name in the rain.Would you open the window   And drop me down the key?.I've just seen a face,   I can't forget the time or place   That we'd just met, she's just the girl for me   And I want all the world to see we've met   Na na na na na na      Had it been another day   I might have looked the other way   But I had never been aware   And as it is I dream of her tonight   Na na na na na na      [CHORUS:]   Falling, yes I am falling   And she keeps calling me back again      I have never known   The likes of this, I've been alone   And I have missed things and kept out of sight   But other girls were never quite like this   Na na na na na na      [CHORUS]   I've just seen a face   I can t forget the time or place   And we'd just met, she's just the girl for me   And I want all the world to see we've met   Na na na na na na      [CHORUS].Flow gently sweet afton : to barbara mcpherson   Flow gently sweet afton among the green braes   Flow gently I'll sing thee a song of thy praise   My marys' asleep by the murmuring stream   Flow gently sweet afton disturb not her dream   Thou stock dove whose echo resounds thro' the glen   Ye wild whistling blackbirds in yon thorny den   Thou greencrested lapwing thy screaming forbear   I charge you disturb not my slumbering fair   Thy crystal stream aftom how lovely it glides   And winds by the cot where my mary resides   How wanton thy waters her snowy feet lave   As gathering sweet flowerets she stems thy clear wave   Flow gently sweet afton among thy green braes   Flow gently sweet river the theme of my lays   My mary's asleep by the murmuring stream   Flow gently sweet afton disturb not her dream.A mother tonight is rocking a cradle in Bethlehem   while wise men follow through the dark a star that beckons them..The grey of evening   Fills the room   No need to look outside   To see or feel the rain   I reach across to touch her   But I know that she's not there   Rain keeps running down the window pane   Time keeps running out for me      Can't you see what you are doing to me   Can't you see what you have done   As I try to pass another long and sleepless night   As a hundred crazy voices call my name   As I try to pass them by   I almost can believe that she is here   Here in the glow of the night      Do you know what you have done   Do you know what you've begun   Do you see we shall never be together again   All of my life      All the lonely people, empty rooms   And all the pointless violence, silent tombs   Could it be that we shall be together again      Sheets of double glazing   Help to keep outside the night   Only foreign city sirens can cut through   Nylon sheets and blankets   Help to minimize the cold   But they can't keep out the chilling sounds   Will the nightmare soon give way to dreaming   That she is here with me   Here in the glow of the night      Do you know what you have done   Do you know what you've begun   Do you see we shall never be together again   All of my life      All the lonely people, empty rooms   And all the pointless violence, silent tombs   Could it be that we shall be together again.The features of the setting affected the cyclist by lack of water, poisonous snake, the condition of the rode for example the lack of water affected the cyclist because he couldn't make it wi thout water he could of passed out if he didnt have water. Another example of how the setting affected the cyclist would be the poisonous snake if he would have  goten bitten he could have died cause there would be nobody to help him. And the last example of how the setting affected him would be the conditon of the road because it make it tougher for the cyclist to get to his destination with hills and windy rounds this is how I think the setting affected  the  cyclist."

Then the cyclist starts his journey with not a lot of water. When he got to the second town “I notice the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short rolling hills.’ This quote means that he wasn’t expecting hills, he thought it was going o be a flat way. Also in the @NUM1 degree whether with limited water supply, he couldnt ride up and down hills. Going down the hills gave him a break. Thats how the cyclist was affected by the settings features."

One feature that affects him is his lack of water:"" The water bottles contained only a few tantallizing sips. The lack of water made him very desperate, especially when he came to the welch’s grape juice factory. The  building-abandoned years earlier-had been a welch’s grape juice factory and bottling plant."" This despersion, after he had come to the abondoned factory, was followed by dissapointment and a vague sense of hopelessness expressed by the phrase, ""I hung my head"" after he had found the abondoned factory. These are some of the features of the setting that affect the cyclist."

very discouraged by the dry and hot settings around him. A feature is something specific about some thing else. In ‘Rough Road Ahead. Do not exceed posted speed limit the cyclist takes the advice of a few old men that seems to be somewhat outdated, and gets him lost as he is running out of water and energy. The cyclist says “Over one long, crppling hill, a building came into view. I wiped the sweat from my eyes to make sure it wasn’t a mirage” (Kurmaskie @NUM1). He is greatly affected by the heat and was so tired he wanted to make sure the building was not an illusion. Also, the changed terrain affected how much water he drank and how hard he had worked just to get up that one long hill. The dry climate and tough terrain greatly affected the cyclist."
"Can you see the real me?.The bittersweet sadness of time passing by   Trying to hold back the years   you try to reach out and touch yesterday   But yesterday just disappears      We've shared a lot of sadness   We've shared a lot of pain   Let's make good use of the time that remains      Let's make every moment count   Let's taste the richness of life to it's fullest amount   Between me and you and all we've been through   There are no problems that we can't surmount   Let's make every moment count   Let's make every moment count      I still remember the day we first meet   We both didn't have a care   The years have flown, but we've both grown   We're none of the worse for the wear      We're only just beginning   I'm still your lover and your friend   And it's never too late to dream again      You say we've seen the best of all our memories   But if your heart and soul are in it   We'll make a new one every minute.Cause I'm tired of dreaming the future becoming past..Still rainin' still dreamin'..Hope there's room in your world for me (Can't you find a place for me ?)..All the way home we felt we had a chance   To review the coulds before we were born   And to invite a new game of can'ts      Absorbed in the clouds a voice from afar said   ""With the right device you can make a pattern grow   Or you can tune up your car""      So we stayed on the train admiring the time   As the lights of the city drew near   We drank a little wine      They were blurry and green outer space in between   With a depth and a form unclear   Then we saw it up ahead      A flickering lantern lit up on the tracks   In the rugs that had covered up the bridge   From the banks of a river to the bed   Of the valley upstream to the place we live      The glass on the lantern cast back the sight   Of a drive-in movie we drove by below   We saw where we'd been in the pictures within   Projecting all the places we would go   So we follow the scene and flowed up your steps   To a smooth wooden floor in a trance   The train whistle melody woved through the trees   And in through the door to signal the turns of a dance.You're always finding out   About the things that people never talk about   I didn't ask to know   But now I'm compensating as I go   I know the script I'm in   I'm only thoughts of heaven trapped in flesh and skin   And from the world of men   I try to tighten up the code again   And the code is a play   A play is a song   A song is a film   A film is a dance   Boot me up on the Zen Machine   Log me onto the Zen Machine   Load me down   Everybody get ready   Hook me into the Zen Machine   Sharing time on the Zen Machine   Load me up   Everybody get ready   Sometimes it's clear to me   Then for a moment I'm in timeless ecstasy   There are no reasons why   And everyone's a passer-by   But when they've gone to bed   A fire's burning on the screen and in my head   And on a windy day   You can smell it from a mile away   And the smell is a note   A note is a taste   A taste is a hue   A hue is a touch.In the essay “Do Not Exceed Speed Limit,” the features of the setting affected the cyclist in a few ways. One way it affected him was that the temperature was very hot and by it being hot outside his water wouldn’t stay cool. This is a problem because you need nice, cool, refreashing water to stay hydrated. Another way was when he hit a fork in the road. He didn’t know which way to go. All he saw was one ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that couldn’t hold the lamest mule greeted me. The sight was troubling. Last but not least this water pump wasn’t working very well so he got down on his hands and knees and started pumping. The water wouldn’t cool down. He tried a drop or two and the water tasted like battery acid. Those are some features of the setting that affected the cyclist on his journey."

There were no buildings or people to the town anywhere. This emptiness meant that there was no help from anyone and he could die with out anyone knowing. Also the setting seems to be very dry and have desert like conditions, without water the cyclist would be dehydrated and could suffer from a heat stroke. Also the setting seems to be very hot. The heartt also makes the cyclist physically dehydrated and mentally considers the logic of a heat stroke at the time."

Joe @CAPS1 starts with being happy and confident to determined yet help helpless and then to relief. Joe writes, “Things began well enough… flat roads…” This quote suggests that in the beginning, everything was okay. He started out with a “smile on the face.” (@NUM1) @CAPS2, things start to change @CAPS1 hits changing terrain. He writes, “…I noticed the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short rolling hills.” This quote states the changing terrain. He starts to lose water to keep him going, yet he pushes himself to the next “town”. Finally, when the author reaches “Gary & Wilber’s fish camp” he is relived when he sees an old guy sitting. The two men say, “know The best way to get There? “Yes sir! I own a very good map.” This reveals that Joe didn t ask for more directions which was his first mistake. In addition, changes in setting can chang a persons mood and attitude."

For example, when the terrain turned to hills, the cyclist had to struggle to climb the hills which caused him to use more of his energy. Also, if the terrain was flat and smooth, the cyclist had less problems making the long journey. For instance, if the cyclist had less strain on him then he would not be as tired and would not drink as much water. In conclusion, that is how the features of the setting affect the cyclist."

For instance if  you are hot, tree could be shade, or thirsty, a river neer by could help your thirst. If you were hungry and hot, but nothing was near you this could make you hot. In this cyclist case the environment affected him in many ways, from bumpy roads, “ghost towns, and trees. For example he said, “The sun was beginning to beat down, but I barley noticed,” this is because of the ""cool pines"" around him as he explains in the next paragraph. It also says in the text that the terrain changed and he even came upon a snake, which added to his thirst. So then making it harder for him to go one. From reading the the text on can see how features can have effects on a person."

The first is the town he came to was a ghost town. Then he was running out of water when he ran by tambleweeds, and a large snake in front of him. He had no more water and there was rough roads ahead of him and he came across a juice factory. No one was there and he was out of water he did not know how longer it would be until he came tp another town. That is why I say that how the features of the setting affected the cyclist."

First it was the rippling streams that taunted his thirst, then the old faucet and last the welches grape factory. The strraing were the beginning stage simply provoking thirst then came the faucet. The faucet made him relise that he was dehydrated. And last the abandoned welches grape juice factory had him almost abandon hope. The setting was effecting his mood."
"I remember seeing someone   Dressed in a suit,   Looking like a lunatic,   And we all fall down,   There's not enough hours in our trip..Should I give up,   Or should I just keep chasing pavements?.Oh      Back over time we were all trying for free   You met the porpoise and me   No right, no wrong you're selling a song, a name   Whisper game      If the real thing don't do the trick   You better make up something quick   You gonna burn, burn, burn, burn, burn to the wick   Oooo, Barracuda, oh yeah      ""Sell me, sell you"" the porpoise said   Dive down deep to save my head   You, I think you got the blues too      All that night and all the next   Swam without looking back   Made for the western pools, silly, silly fools      If the real thing don't do the trick, no   You better make up something quick   You gonna burn, burn, burn, burn, burn it to the wick   Oooo, Barra-Barracuda.Gettin' to know you,   Gettin' to know all about you..I need you too!.Later we went dancing, hanging out all night long - singing all our favourite songs, Cinnamon songs: Oh oh na na na na na na..Let the light shine   Let the light shine.. The features of the setting affects the cyclist. Because the man didn’t have a lot of water and he was go into the California deserts in June. Another reason is because the flat road was changed into rolling hills and up ahead there was a sign that said “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit.” the speed limit was @NUM1. One more thing is make sure you don’t listen to a gentleman that is old and hadn’t be off ther porch in decades. That is some of the things that can affect the cyclist."

In the begining of the story he describes the scenery as ""@CAPS1"". As he continued following the old mens out dated advice. It lead  him through more barren lands. When he came to the first ""town"" he described it as a ghost town. The second setting he arrived at was “One romshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that couldnt hold in the lamest muic” he continued moving to the next town, which was @NUM1 away, he came to what he thought was a Welch's Grape juice factory and bootling plant. This tools a toll on his confidence because he said ""I hung my head"" he moved on and had finally arrived at un abandoned buiding called ""@PERSON2 and wilbers’s fish camp. ""This is where he drunk water and became repleshed. The setting had a great effect on the cyclist. Because depending on the location, decided weather he would live or die in the hot deserts of California."

He is in a hot place similar to a desert. It is very hot there and is affecting him during his travels,""I eased past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state. Another thing that affected him because of the setting was that the desert had rocky roads and windy paths because he followed the old mans direction. ""Rough Road Ahead"" are final example is that he was in the desert so he saw a snake come out of the tumbleweeds."" A large snake it really did look like a diamond back."" @CAPS1 are three examples how the cyclist had been affected due to the setting of the story.   "

They had to dismiss many hardships such as lack of water, being lost, immense desert heat, plus minor things like snakes and road conditions. The setting of the California desert in June was the most intense hardship. That and the lack of water. Though the heat starting powing at the cyclists’ brain by making them see mirages, etc. The heat and entire setting made the cyclists’ travel much harder."

Tempt me, sweet tempest - and shower me with stars   I want to be as beautiful as you   Take me to the summit and show me   Show me all that I could ever have   You brought me everything, I ever thought I wanted   And now you take it all away   You gave me love and then you killed me blindly   I think I'll die for you today, I can't persue another way....I could corrupt you   In a heart beat   You think your so special   Think your so sweet   What are you trying don't even tempt me   Soon you'll be crying unwishing you dreamt of be   You'll be calling out my name   When you need someone to blame      I can corrupt you   It would be easy   Watching you suffer   God, it would please me      I wanna touch you with my little finger   I know it will crush you my memory would linger   You'd be crying out in pain   Begging me to play my games      I can corrupt you   It will be ugly   They could sedate you   But what good would drugs be   I wanna touch you with my hands on your hips   It would be too much to   Place my lips on your lips   You'll be calling out my name   Begging me to play my games.It stays the same..The setting in the story “Do not exceed posted speed limit” reflect upon the cyclist. In the story a cyclist is riding his bike and takes directions from some old men. Later he realizes the old men probably had no idea that things change overtime. He says “Never accept travel advice from a collection of old-timers who haven’t left their porches since carter was in office.”(Kurmaskie @NUM1). The cyclist takes the old-timers “shortcut” and it takes forever to reach his destination. At the end he reaches his campsite and another person askes him for directions. This time the cyclist says “Yes, sir! I own a very good map,” and “I’d always stick to it in the future.” The cyclist’s message is to follow a map, something you know is right, not a person that @MONTH1 be lying or irresponsible."
"Lies, dripping off your mouth like dirt   Lies, lies in every step you walk   Lies, whispered sweetly in my ear   Lies, how do I get out of here?.Everybody got some days that they can't explain..I'm nobody's fool!.Heartbreaker, can't take her,   Heartbreaker, bringing me down..And someone else is knitting things for your ears..Take a look inside   I've got nothing to hide, oh, no   I'll beat around the bush   I've got nothing but time, oh no, oh no      You've got me holding on to nothing   But nothing is all I've got      [Chorus:]   Leave me, leave me,   I'm a shut it all down   You've got a tendency to bring a man down   I give up, I give up   You've gotta get a gun to make a woman run      So this is what it feels like   I'll give you the last word   It's alright, it's alright, it's alright      Now this is the town, this is the place   If you are the one to give disgrace a name   Then So be it      You've got me holding on to nothing   But nothing is all I've got      [Chorus 2x]      Oh take my car, oh take my house   I never liked that beat up motor mouth   And it only looks so warm tonight   Just like a stranger in the candlelight      Take take take take   Take it all      [Chorus 2x]      Leave me now   Leave me now.I wish I'd had the time to look into your eyes   And quietly say the words   The words that you'd expect   I wish I'd touched your face   And you would hold my hand   Then tears were on our guard   And silence was our friend   And we would leave behind the chaos in our lifes   The struggle and the strife and the black and white   And all the letters that we wrote   Would be printed out in gold   In our memories to behold   Without explanations   To be told....this story is set in the hot in the hot desert in June and the character is a cyclist trying to get to a National Park. the setting affects the cyclist because the hotter it is the more water you need to keep you hydrated, but the man is alone in the desert. This quote “about forty miles in the pedal I arrived as my first “town”. The place might have been a thriving little syos as one time”. This quote shows how deserted the desert is and how as he rides there is nobody around no where to re-hydrate no where to get drecionsn he was alone."

The heat made him get dehydrated faster while he was using energy. The long abandoned roads further increased his doubt of living the whole bike ride. He used up allof his water. So when he got to the old pump hot dirty water came out. The snake in the story made the journey for this guy perilous and deadly. This all happened because he listened to the old guys. When the other old guy was about to tell him whereto go he said no."

Throughout the story however, the cyclist endures many conflicts to his successs in his journey. The cyclist faced his first difificulty once he reached a small, abandoned town. “I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly, and I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June” (kurmaskie @NUM1). The cyclist realized he had not conserved his water and his “water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips” (kurmaskie @NUM1). On top of his water problem the heat was unbelievable. He was losing hydration from all the sweat, and he was losing it quickly. The cyclist was also dealing with the difficult roads. There were many things this cyclist endured through-out his journey, but he was determined to finish his trip and was filled with satisfaction once he overcame these hardships."

He rode into the morning when would make him tired. The first town he reaches upon was a ghost town so that means he could rest get his supplies. Then he arrive by cool pines and rushing river which probably makes him feel releaxed. Then he showed up at a ramshack shed with several rusty pumps and a carrol that couldn’t hold in the lamest made. Gated men which people made him feel uncocleible, and the pumps did not give him water so that was nobody also pointing. Then he was rideing through the California deserts in June witch probably made him more dehirrated."

The map would have been a lot safer and easier. People seem to always look for a shortcut, including myself. He could have died from heat stroke and lack of water. He did have perseverance though he never gave up and that is what saved him. Being in that situation and setting I would have given up."

For example, it says “and ther growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke on a georgus day in June”. Also , he thinks he is getting dehydrated when he says “I  was doing a water depleting 12 mph. sometimes life could be so creul”. in conclusion, this cyclist started this without enough water causing him to think that he was going to die from either heatstroke or dehydration."

In the short story “Do not exceed posted speed limit” by Joe Kurmaskie the cyclist is travelling through the hot desert in June when he realizes hes running out of water, “I had been hitting my water bottles pretty reguarly and I was travelling through the high deserts of California in June”(Kurmaskie). This is affecting the cyclist because hes becoming hot and has a low supply of water. Also the cyclist realizes he should have never taken the direction from the old men and thinks to himself, “…The growing realization that I could drop from heat stroke on a gorgeous day in June”(Kurmaskie). This quote proves that the heat of the desert is taking a toll on him."
"Yes, I'm gonna praise you lord, with all my strength and might..Dreary days are over   Life's a four leaf clover   Sessions of depressions are through   Every hope I longed for long ago, comes true      Long ago and far away   I dreamed a dream one day   And now that dream is here beside me   Long the skies were overcast   But now the clouds have passed   You're here at last      Chills run up and down my spine   Aladdin's Lamp is mine   The dream I dreamed was not denied me   Just one look and then I knew   That all I longed for   Long ago was you      Chills run up and down my spine   Aladdin's Lamp is mine   The dream I dreamed was not denied me   Just one look and then I knew   That all I longed for   Long ago was you      That all I longed for   Long ago was you.I would pray..When you get to the border, you buy a bottle of booze..Now, I was sittin' in a little speakeasy,   When I came across that delta girl,   She said, ""I hope you understand."".Mama couldn't be persuaded   When they pleaded with her   ""Daughter don't marry that gamblin' man."".[Verse 1]   Oh baby, you stay on my brain, I smoke, kick back and think   Sometimes a nigga be lonely, so many bitches, I ain't gotta be   So got the crew on the way, huh, no work, all play   I got a castle with the boat, everybody, we gon' live it up, aye   Keep talking mami but I ain't tryna hit it right now   Oh keep watching me, we sitting here tryna have a good time right now      [Pre-Chorus]   Cause babe, the truth is you don't have to think about it, if you new to this, lemme show you how   Raise your middle finger to your problems, yeah, if you let 'em, they gon' bring you down   Keep tripping on us but we just stunting on 'em right now   They hating on us, they just mad cause we way up, right now      [Chorus]   So blow it in the wind   Let the sparks fly now, get your mind blown   Let the good times get your back, let the sparks fly now   We can smile and then they wonder why, we up now   So blow it in the wind   We can't let them other niggas kill the vibe   So blow it in the wind   All that bullshit, we gon' let it ride      [Verse 2]   So fuck it, call in sick, they don't pay enough anyway   Shit you might as well quit cause every now and then you need a break   Girl I feel you, I'mma pour it up right now   Aye so fall through cause they gon' have to shut us down      [Pre-Chorus]   Cause babe, the truth is you don't have to think about it, if you new to this, lemme show you how   Raise your middle finger to your problems, yeah, if you let 'em, they gon' bring you down   Keep tripping on us but we just stunting on 'em right now   They hating on us, they just mad cause we way up, right now      [Chorus]   So blow it in the wind   Let the sparks fly now, let the good times get your back   Let the sparks fly now   We can smile and then they wonder why, we up now   So blow it in the wind   We can't let them other niggas kill the vibe   So blow it in the wind   All that bullshit, we gon' let it ride      [Bridge]   Hit the corner, swerving left to right   You know we get to ducking when we see them lights   I catch a charge and beat it   I pop a 30, codeine got me leaning   Yeah yeah, you know the strong don't quit   Yeah you know my shooters don't miss   Steady double cup in the fifth, ice   Me and my niggas be young, black and rich, wassup   I got my feet up in the two seater   Niggas stay looking but don't wanna see us   So to the haters and true believers   All my people, you know I see ya   Hey yeah, yeah yeah   Yeah sing it baby like   Hey yeah, yeah yeah   Hey yeah, yeah yeah   Hey yeah, yeah yeah      [Chorus]   So blow it in the wind   Let the sparks fly now, get your mind blown   Let the good times get your back, let the sparks fly now   We can smile and then they wonder why, we up now   So blow it in the wind   We can't let them other niggas kill the vibe   So blow it in the wind   All that bullshit, we gon' let it ride.In the essay, “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” by Joe Kurmaskie, the setting affects him negatively because he was on his bicycle and he was in a hot area and no water whatsoever, like  in this quote, “I  got down on my hands and knees, working the handle of the rusted water pump with all my strength. A tar like substance ozzed out.” In the quote, the cyclist finally thinks he has found a water pump but he really gets nothing. Also, another negative thing is that he thought he was never going  to get to where he was going, but in the end , he got there and he got some water."
"Ain't no love, sure 'nuff is a pity,   Ain't no love 'cause you ain't around,   'Cause you ain't around..You might win some, but you really lost one   You just lost one, it's so silly how come?.And I know there's a song somewhere for you and I..Somethin' each moment reminds me of you:   You always end up on my mind..One kiss   One kiss   (Made in heaven)   So many questions needing answers      How will it be with me when it hits me   Can it happen in a second   Will it be just like a ringing bell   When it calls me      Is it just like music and lights   Or is that just a fairytale   Will I see it   Can I hear it      How does it feel   It's all such a mystery   But one kiss and I'll know   If it's really meant to be I won't let go      They say true love   Is made in heaven   I'm so full of mixed emotions   Does it get to you deep inside      All at once you see the changes   Do you feel like you can face the world   Hear the music   See the lights      To know what it means   When you face your destiny   Will I see it   Can I hear it      How does it feel   It's all such a mystery   But one kiss and I'll know   If it's really meant to be I won't let go      They say true love   Is made in heaven   One look and I'll see   No other face for all eternity      They say true love   Is made in heaven   On kiss   True love      One kiss   True love   When it calls me   Is it just like music and lights      Or is love just a fairytale   Will I see it   Can I hear it   How does it feel      It's all such a mystery   But one kiss and I'll know   If it's really meant to be I won't let go   They say true love      Is made in heaven   One look and I'll see   No other face for all eternity   They say true love      Is made in heaven   But one kiss and I'll know   If it's really meant to be I won't let go   They say true love   Is made in heaven.What became of the night on a six cylinder charger   With money to burn and a castle for two ?.It's the last time the first time for me..The setting of the essay greatly affected the cyclist. These settings discourage him, although he tries to keep hope. Seeing dry desert, hills begin to heighten, nothing man-made is in sight. These subconsciously affect the cyclist and his growth of thirst. To one point the cyclists original objective became invalidated for his thirst pangs and exhaustion."
"I can feel you're so real, I can see you're so near   And the you run..Lucille, baby, satisfy my heart..And the cradle will rock..I wanna know who's loving you      It's been years without you      Then why do I dream of you   Afraid that this heart still beats for you   Hoooo...

This shows or explains that the going could get a little tougher now because he will have to be riding up hills and he is almost out of water. “There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind” (@NUM2 Kurmaskie). This explains that the man could not get water or a ride from anywhere around, because there was nothing out there to at. This is how the setting features affected the cyclists."
"I want a drink..I bought a bonnet to suit my face   I had my petticoat trimmed with lace   I looked at the mirror, around I twirled   And then I went out in the wide, wide world      I dreamed of gentlemen I would meet   I saw them all kneeling at my feet   I can't understand it, my hair is all curled   But my goodness me, it's a great big world      [Chorus:]   And it's a cold, cold, cold and we'll soon be old   Alas and a lack, it's a great big world..You can put me to rest, what you do is the best..Been so many places, seen so many faces,   Always on my way to somethin' new..All night stand,   Seen a good half a million places, yeah..The time is with the month of winter solstice   When the change is due to come..In real life I'm waking up alone   It's one more night you didn't make it home   And one more time you won't pick up the phone   In real life you never bring me flowers   When you're here it's only for an hour   I'm getting used to being on my own      Because in real life you're not what I thought   Real life, this isn't what I want   Guess things aren't always what they seem      [Chorus]   But in my dreams, I'm waking up to roses   Champagne, kisses and I know it's always, always   Gonna be, gonna be this way   In my dreams, you're standing right beside me   Two hearts finally colliding   Then I wake up and realize, realize this is real life      Real life, this is real life, real life, real life   Real life, whoa-oh, whoa-oh, whoa-oh, oh, real life      In real life it doesn't always work out   People fall in love and then they fall out   Hearts can break and never make a sound      Because in real life you're not what I thought   Real life, this isn't what I want   Guess things aren't always what they seem      [Chorus]      Just when I thought this was all real life could be   Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah   Somebody came along and made my dream reality      And now in real life, waking up to roses   Champagne, kisses and I know it's always, always   Gonna be, gonna be this way   In my dreams, he's standing right beside me   Two hearts finally colliding   When I wake up, I realize, realize this is real life.In the setting there are no cars and no buildings meaning no help. The cyclist is tired and dehydrated because he ran out of water. No one was around because it was the desert. The cyclist was dehydrated but kept going to his destination. The road was straight but almost to the end there were many hills. Along with having to bike up the hills he almost ran into a snake. The weather was hot he had no water, he could have died."
"Oh, oh-oh, ooh-oh   Ah-ah      Last Christmas, I gave you my heart   But the very next day, you gave it away   This year, to save me from tears   I'll give it to someone special      Last Christmas, I gave you my heart   But the very next day, you gave it away (You gave it away)   This year, to save me from tears   I'll give it to someone special (Special)      Once bitten and twice shy   I keep my distance, but you still catch my eye   Tell me baby, do you recognize me?.They got nothing on me   Anymore   They got nothing on you   I don't care   What they say anymore   All I want is the truth      I don't feel   To unveil   In my soul   Singled out      They got nothing on me   Anymore   They got nothing on you   I don't care   What they say anymore   All I want is the truth      I don't feel   To unveil   Hear my sound   Singled out   Watch my style   Pick a place   Wipe the smile   From your face      I feel no way   To unveil   In my soul   Singled out   Watch my style   Pick a place   Wipe the smile   From your face      Hey-e   Yeah-e-ey      They got nothing on me   Anymore   They got nothing on you   I don't care   What they say anymore   All I want is the truth.A is for apricot      B is for blossom      C is for cantelope      D is for dog-gone awesome      E is extremely blessed and endowed      F is for fabulous      That's what this song's all about      Big top women sure do bounce around      I love to see them walkin' up and down      The steps of the courthouse make you go downtown      I had to get some new tags      My plates had done run out      I had to get some new tags      My plates had done run out      And the tax assesor certainly left no doubt      That the big top women sure do bounce around      I love to see them walkin' up and down      Ba-Ba-Boom Ba-Ba-Boom Ba-Ba-Boom      Make you go down town      I met this meter maid, Nadine      She didn't carry no gun around      But she was packin' some 38's      Big tittie man get right down on the ground      Now the big top women sure do bounce around      I love to see them walkin' up and down      Steps of the courthouse      Make you wanna get a ticket and      Go downtown      I went downtown after work      This joint called the hot house      They had some big top women there      And whoo, they then came out      I said girl you sure look fine      With your uniform gone      She had hundred dollar bills      Stuck in her thong      Yea, big top women sure got it goin' on.She could not see me through the windows..Or will I be seeing you soon?.So it's fare thee well my own true love,   We'll meet another day, another time..Do that Hebrew thing!. The setting in this story is very hard for the cyclist. His main problem is the lack of water. If you deprive the body of water all of your major organs will bake in the hot sun. Another problem was the condition of the terrain. It is very hard to cycle on bumpy dry land. These are any a few problems the cyclist encountered."
"When they turn the pages of history   When these days have passed long ago   Will they read of us with sadness   For the seeds that we let grow   We turned our gaze   From the castles in the distance   Eyes cast down   On the path of least resistance      Cities full of hatred   Fear and lies   Withered hearts   And cruel, tormented eyes   Scheming demons   Dressed in kingly guise   Beating down the multitude   And scoffing at the wise      The hypocrites are slandering   The sacred halls of truth   Ancient nobles showering   Their bitterness on youth   Can't we find   The minds that made us strong   Can't we learn   To feel what's right and wrong      Cities full of hatred   Fear and lies   Withered hearts   And cruel, tormented eyes   Scheming demons   Dressed in kingly guise   Beating down the multitude   And scoffing at the wise   Can't we raise our eyes   And make a start   Can't we find the minds   To lead us closer to the heart.Everybody say wham!.Man, it's been a long day   Stuck thinking 'bout it driving on the freeway   Wondering if I really tried everything I could   Not knowing if I should try a little harder      Ooh, but I'm scared to death   That there may not be another one like this   And I confess   That I'm only holding on by a thin, thin thread   I'm kicking the curb 'cause you never heard   The words that you needed so bad   And I'm kicking the dirt 'cause I never gave you   The things that you needed to have   I'm so sad, sad      Man, it's been a long night   Just sitting here trying not to look back   Still looking at the road we never drove on   And wondering if the one I chose was the right one      Ooh, but I'm scared to death   That there may not be another one like this   And I confess   That I'm only holding on by a thin, thin thread   I'm kicking the curb 'cause you never heard   The words that you needed so bad   And I'm kicking the dirt 'cause I never gave you   The things that you needed to have   I'm so sad, sad      So sad, so sad      Ooh, but I'm scared to death   That there may not be another one like this   And I confess   That I'm only holding on by a thin, thin thread   I'm kicking the curb 'cause you never heard   The words that you needed so bad   And I'm kicking the dirt 'cause I never gave you   The things that you needed to have      And I'm kicking the curb 'cause you never heard   The words that you needed so bad   I'm so sad, so sad.Don't you know, don't you know   Everyday I love you more?.( La, la la la, la ..I felt a hand pull me up as I was going under..I guess I'll have to live with the choice that I have made   Even though deep down I still suspect that I blew it..The feature of the setting greatly affect the cyclist in “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit.” The features in the story changed the speaker’s mood throughout his journey. For example, in the beginning he came across a deserted town so he was cautious. Next, he came across a fork in the road which was troubling to him. Then he passed a snake and had the obstacles of the hills which made him become determined. Finally, his determination changed to relief where he reached Gary and Wilber’s fish camp. In conclusion, the setting in the story greatly affects the cyclist by changing his moods and attitude towards his journey."
"Down your throat I'm never sure if it's still you..Ho bitch!.War war is stupid and people are stupid   And love means nothing in some strange quarters   War war is stupid and people are stupid   And I heard them banging on hearts and fingers   War!.You think it's funny?.[I'll fly over there and turn off all your lights.].Don't ask me why, it's my mind ,   It's better, it's better than being alone,   Alone on the ground..Come live with me and be my love   Share my bread and wine   Be a part of me, the heart of me   Be mine   Come live with me and be my love   Let our dreams combine   Be wife to me, be life to me   Be mine   With these hands I will build a roof   To shield your head   And with these hands I will carve the wood   For our baby's bed   Come live with me and be my love   And let me love you all the time   Be mate to me, be fate to me   Be mine   I will try to do my best for you   I swear, I promise you   I will cry for you, I will comfort you   My whole life through   Come live with me and be my love   Share my bread and wine   Be a part of me, be the heart of me   Be mine.The setting in “Do Not @CAPS1 Posted speed limits” affects the mood of the cyclist in that every time the setting changes the mood of the cyclist changes. In the begining of the story the cyclist is riding through the “cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite.” @CAPS2 this time the cyclist is enjoying his trip and is in a positive mood. As the story goes on “there was no one in sight, not a building, a car, or structure of any land.” At this point in the story the cyclist has exchanged his positive mood for a desperate one as his water begins to run out."
"The worlds are about to get me again   Shit ain't pretend I'm safer in the madhouse   Clinging to the selene like a spider   I'm out of your mind like frozen fire   Razorblade fingers scratchin my neck   Lost in the maze I found a dragon barbeque in the back   A arm came out of the toilet and squaws my balls   That shirt hurt got me head but holes in the walls   I wanna see you!.So, I decided, to take up the mantle, was given the handle of Prince..Am I out of range?.When you hold me close,   Pretend like you don't want to let me go..T-r-u-s-t in me, I'm sexy but I'm pussy,   The homies in the hood call me lil' bo peep,   And you da type a nigga I been dyin' ta meet,   So snoopy, what'chu tryin' to do?.I tried to tell my mamma but she told me,   ""This is one for your dad."".She says the kids are fine and that they miss me,   Maybe I could come and babysit sometime..Poisonous snakes, mirages, rolling hills, and dry dead tumbleweed these features in the setting that the cyclist was going through have the greatest effect of all. They showed the trecherous path he took the obstacles he had to surpass the prevail. The purpose of including some features of the setting like the poisonous snakes, mirages, rolling hills, no signs of life, and no water all show and impact how bad the conditions were. If it left out these sectives the audience could say/think he was traveling through any old trail, for all they know the cyclist could be traveling along a windy river passing threw nice developed towns, so you see the features in the setting help set the mood and also reveal the confident of the story."
"Oh, the day we met, I went astray,   I started rollin' down that lost highway..He taught you all he knew   To fear no mortal man   and now you'll wreak your vengeance in the   Screams of evil men..Living on a thin line,   Tell me now, what are we supposed to do?.Our life could be...   Are you satisfied?.The family tried so hard to find her   They Showed Her Picture across America..Everyday we earn our meager pay   But it takes its toll to play the happy prole..It's the 80s, what you looking at, ya mong?.The features of the setting affect the cyclist because if is very hot and is summertime. The cyclist wouldn’t have gotten so tired and exhausted if he wasn’t in a “ghost town”, with the, “sun beggining to beat down”. It was in @CAPS1 for nia during June so it was. Very hot, the water was also @NUM1 degrees! The text as states there were rolling hills and tumble weeds, so it must have been a desert kind of area. The trip was also a very long one, “about forty miles into the petal”, causing him to be tired. As you can see the setting was an area with no people, and it was very hot."
"My man is the best in the world,   He knows me like the palm of his hand..Oh oh oh   Mystical Advisor   What is my problem, tell me   Can you see?.Revelation, unknowing has been taken..Sinai   And my best friend Bill   died from a poison pill   some wired doctor prescribed for stress   My arms and legs are shrunk   the food all has lumps   They discovered some animal no one's ever seen   It was an inside trader eating a rubber tire   after running over Rudy Giuliani   They say the President's dead   but no one can find his head   It's been missing now for weeks   But no one noticed it   he has seemed so fit   and I'm Sick of it.I'm confessing that I love you, over again.Lets talk about these things we see   Walking across the land   Lets talk about these joints I got   Every body get down   Lets talk about these things we see   Lets talk about these joints I got      [Chorus]   Lets talk about the rules I bring   And the things we take   And the jobs we hold   And the land we stole   And a buck or two   And the love for you   And the things you do [Repeat: x5]      I puff L's with ladies and gentlemen   I break spells with faith in a burst of wind   Others talk but.what they talk about?.But I but I'll stop and I'll stare   At that face in the throng   Yes, I'll know when my love comes along   That he'll stand before my eyes one day   I won't need a second glance his way   I'll know when my love comes along   I'll know then and there   I'll know at the sight of his face   How I care, how I care, how I care   And I'll stop, and I'll stare at that face in the throng   Yes, I'll know when my love comes along.The features of the setting affect the cyclist because as the terrain got rougher things to the cyclist got harder. In paragraph @NUM1; there is a senteance that says, “It read: Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit.” In the next paragraph the cyclist comments, “sometimes life can feel so cruel.” @CAPS1 because the road ahead got rough to the cyclist life was cruel. All the features like the snake, lack of water and rolling hills are all obsticules in life, people have to experience. We might not like it but the reward at the end is wonderful."
"I can't handle it anymore..I just know what to say..Well it looks like it's another Skynyrd Family Christmas time   Seems like it was just New Years day   Started out in old L.A.

This biker is riding in the middle of a desert on a summer’s day. The sweat dropping down him is just speeding up his dehydration. This is shown when the narration states, “wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that i could drop from heatstroke” (Kurmaskie). This show how hot the desert was, and how he could drop dead. The desert is also deserted with rolling tumbleweeds and giant snakes, as he passed abandoned towns and factories. The dangerousness for a biker in this area is very high. The biker was lucky to have made it out of those sorroundings alive."
"They dropped us off here with no direction,   But you never even tried to fight the current..I Want Out!.How could I ever find it?.Highways take me over the mountains....And I bet that she could grow a beard   I feel better thinking you were queer   It's not fair   I can't compare   To an ugly girl   To an ugly girl   Lalalalalalalala Lalalalalalalala Lalalalalalalala   Lalalalalalalala Lalalalalalalala Lalalalalalalala   Hahaha the jokes on me   I feel jealous and I feel mean   She's so nice that it makes up for her face   There's no way, do you have to keep your eyes closed   Do you have to keep the lights down low?.Silly boy boy (boy boy)   Acting acting silly boy?.You say I'm a love,   And be mine every way..The features of the setting affects the cyclist in many ways. First of all, if the cyclist didn’t listen to the old man, he would have never gone through this trouble. Also being that he didn’t have enough water when he went on riding, caused him to be real dehydrated. He should of turned back as soon as he ran out of water. Plus the heat made him real hot and thirsty. He should know how to never trust any strangers and try things on his own."

At first it was flat road which the speaker was happy with and he had “a smile on.” (@NUM1). Then came large rolling hills which created a challenge, the cyclist needed to muster up enough energy to continue. The rough terrain was next causing the cyclist to work even harder to cycle. As if the rough terrain wasn’t energy soaking enough, a snake blocked a majority of pavement and large elevations came into play. The harder the terrain, the harder for the cyclist."

He took directions from older people who promised the rider a short cut. I turned out that their short cut was wrong. When the rider went on this trip, it was June in California. It would have been burning hot. Lastly he had drank most of his water during the trip. He could have died if he didn’t find the other water source. These were some elements that effected the rider on his trip."

When he was cycling it be came very hott to him but at first it wasn’t so bad. “The sun was begining to beat dow, but I barely Noticed it.” This proves that the cyclist knows it was getting hot but it did not affect him. Another thing that affected him was the time that he was travling in. “I had been hitting my water bottles pritty regularly and I was travling through the high dezerts in califonia in June.” This proves that the reader was constantly drinking because of the time of day and year he was out. All of this shows that the setting affected the cyclist on his @CAPS2. "

The features of the setting affect the cyclist in a couple different ways. When the cyclist found the gohst town since no one was there he could not ask someone for better directions or get some food or water. The short rolling hills make it harder to pedal because it is hard to pedal uphill. At the end of the story he found a bait shop where he got water and better direction's."

The cyclist is affected because the setting is depressing and frightening. When the cyclist first sees the speed limit sign of 55 mph, he says, “Sometimes life can be so cruel”. Because he can only go 12 mph considering he's on a bike. After seeing the sign, a snake crosses his path. He’s frightened by it because it looked like a diamond back and he was trying to keep his balance and ease past it. Since the main problem the cyclist is faced with is the lack of water, the dry, long hills seem to make him more weak and tired. Tumble weeds crossed past him and there was no water in sight That is how the features of the setting affect the cyclist."

But after he left first town he had been riding and needed water, so he stoped at a fork in the road he had just to;to get water from a pump which tastes like battery acid. Then as he progressed further in his trip he came to a sign that said “Rough Road Ahead: Do not exceed speed limit”(Joe Kurmaskie pg @NUM1) This part of his trip made it very challenging by making him face rough roads and mountains that he had to cross which sucked the water out of him. Then as  he came over the last mountain, he saw a sign for a gart store. So when he arrived he got some water and got directions for a man who had the best map. So you can see that going over an the mountains, sucks all the water out of the cyclist, so he was so relieved when he got the water at the end."

It is a very hot day and he is in a desert in California with a limited water supply. It starts becoming very hot, and his water supply begins to decrease quickly. The old men who he says “have not left their porch since @PERSON1 was in office” gave him very wrong directions to Yosemite and he ended up getting lost out in a hot California desert. He eventually came to a fishing store where he refreshed with alot o f water from the sink, and then was off again on his way to Yosemite."

When the cyclist first headed out the road was flat and smooth. Halfway through his trip the “Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.” The cyclist continues to pedel even though he was slowed down to 12 mph. The hills made the ride slower and harder because of the hills. Tuoards the end of the hills he had to make it “Over on long, crippling hill”. The word “crippling“ is used to show the phisical affect that the hill had on him. The hills were a feature of the setting which made the cyclist’s ride longer, harder, and more phisically demanding."

Firts for example the cyclist was in the high deserts of California in the heat of June. Which makes it bad because of the heat makes it harder on the cyclist. Also being in the deserts there wasn’t any watwer supply so after the cyclist ran out of water it got worse because he got dyhigerated, and caused him to become weaker and not pedal as fast. Also the author says that the tarren changes from flat roads, to short rolling hills, which also made it more difficult because the short hills made it more work, and since it was so hot and he didn’t have water he couldn’t funcation as well as if he was hydrated."

In the essay, it says, “ on a gorgeous day in June caused him to laugh.” This shows, despite what happened, he was might are on a nice day outside giving him an optimistic attitude. Also, the beating sun affected him in a different way. It caused him to sweat and almost die of dehydration. “ growing realization that l could drop from heatstroke ” This shows that he was tensely aware that he could die from the suns might. So, the settings around the cyclist affected him in different ways."

Everything was fine until he ran out of water and reached the hills. Now if he was in callada he woudn’t of dehydrated. But the hills were sure to play with his mind. The most import setting is the welchs grape juice factory. He would have had all of the grape juice he wanted, but it was abandoned. An ironic twist “as he calls it. And the last one is hte bait shop that sawes his life, where an old man offers him directions."

For example when the narration says, “At some point, humble weeds crossed my path” (Kurmaskie @NUM1). The tone of the cyclists from the quote above shows despare creeping into his mind. Also, another good example is when the narration says, “@CAPS1 hill, a building came into view” (Kurmaskie @NUM1). The cyclist sounds more hopfull than before. That is how the area the cyclist enters affects him."
"Leavin town, I found a flower that I could deserve..Not for nothing was his only crime,   A final price to pay..Going where the willows weep no more, darlin' baby,   Going where the willows weep no more,   Chilly winds don't blow along my shore, oh baby,   Where the chilly winds, the chilly winds don't blow..Your glory it surrounds me..Another love shark and I      I'm gonna break his spell..That's a pre-programming for the police department!.They keep me thinking that we almost had it all   The scars of your love, they leave me breathless   I can't help feeling...   We could have had it all... (you're gonna wish you never had met me)... Rolling in the deep   (Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)   You had my heart inside... (you're gonna wish you)... Of your hand (never had met me)   And you played it... (tears are gonna fall)... To the beat (rolling in the deep)   Could have had it all   Rolling in the deep..The cyclist was so set on seeing cool, piney trees and lakes, that when he saw dirt, snake, and no source of civilization worried him. More affectively, what he didn’t see scared him most. He did see windy rivers or trails hidden beneath all kinds of trees. He didn’t see any people or friendly little forest critters. Instead he just saw the same rusty color of dirt and the occasional snake. His mood was affected and he started to lose confidence and hope. He wasn't used to the new surroundings and for a while doubted if he could even make it out alive. When he came across the run-down building of Welch’s factory, he was even more distraught. Fortunately, he did find civilization when he came to a fishing supply shop. This definetly boosted his spirits. Once he had saved his thirst problem and assured himself he has alive and would luckily stay that way, he sat down before wading out again in search of his destination."
"You're not supposed to do that   You know you're not allowed to   But you seem to get some kind of kick   Out of doing what you're not allowed to   You deliberately defy the rules   'Cause the law's upheld by fools   Shit on that   Bad boys get spanked      You can look but don't touch   But no you can't resist   Don't you ever think about the consequence   Guys like you never do   That's the kind of stuff boys are made out of   That's the kind of stuff girls are made out of   Bad boys get spanked   Bad boys get spanked      You don't listen do you asshole   Don't be a punk all your life   Someone's gonna sort you out   They'll try to make a man out of you   Say yes sir, say no sir   Say yes ma'am, say no m'am   Shit on that   Bad boys get spanked   Bad boys get spanked      Get spanked, get spanked   Come here, get spanked   Bad boys get spanked   Come here, get spanked.(It's not gonna happen to me)   You're on your own now, believe me..Seek and you shall find what you may already have..[Verse 1: PARTYNEXTDOOR]   I'm in Miami   I need to call up Miss Cassidy   My name is party not participation   Sorry for the miscommunication   I need a drink and some tequila with you   You know what I'm trying to do   Hey let's pop the E off at Liv I've got some time here to blow   I've got the money to blow   I've got the money and blow   Don't have to guess how I know   Oh it's a secret just for me I'll keep it   You old niggas boring as bones   Put the party tape on   You know what's going on   You know what's going on   She keep it wet like tsunami   She think she sunk the Titanic   I get her hot like Wasabi   She think it's wavy and gnarly   I think I'ma pop one for you   Drink one for you      [Hook: PARTYNEXTDOOR]   Young nigga preach   Preach, preach, preach, preach, preach, preach (X3)   Preach (x9)      [Verse 2: Drake]   Still in Miami   Most of these girls are too messy   I've got to do some reflecting   I've got to find me one out here that is good at taking direction   I'm convinced that my calls are being recorded   So hit my assistant to get me the message   And make the connection like brrrrr   I'm on my way tonight I hope you not the crazy type yeah   I'm in your state tonight I might just break the bank tonight   PND ain't with the ray tay tay   You know Jay Ray   Got girls her going way way way way way way   Sauga city trip the pay day   Load up off a gate way   Man you can't afford me   Doing is one thing, doing it right is a whole different story   Niggas is all in their feelings these days, all in their feelings these days   But hearing the scripture with that many sixes you should be afraid      [Hook: PARTYNEXTDOOR].Tears begin to fall every time I hear your name..I'm too much..Ramona couldn't speak or couldn't spell..Rolling hills, open terran, hgh deserts-all are features of the setting that affect the cyclist. First, Rolling Hills could take energy out of the cyclist when having to travel for miles on end. The open terrain leads to the beating sun which also puts pressure on the cyclist. Lastly, high deserts would have an affect on the cyclist because he has to pedal for mles on end in rough dry terrain putting strain on him overall."
"Screaming   I've watched this scene a thousand times      (so) I can taste it   And in my head      This is how it all begins   Yes, I am becoming   And this is how it all begins   What did you expect?.I've got a feeling '21   Is going to be a good year..My love   There's only you in my life   The only thing that's right   My first love   You're every breath I take   You're every step I make      And I   I want to share   All my love with you   No one else will do   And your eyes (your eyes, your eyes)   They tell me how much you care   Oh, yes   You'll always be   My endless love      Two hearts   Two hearts that beat as one   Our lives have just begun   And forever   I'll hold you close in my arms   I can't resist your charms      And I   I'd play the fool   For you, I'm sure   You know I don't mind   (No, you know I don't mind)   And yes   You mean the world to me   I know I've found in you   My endless love      And love   I'd play the fool   For you, I'm sure   You know I don't mind   (Whoa, you know I don't mind)   Oh, yes   You'd be the only one   'Cause no, I can't deny   This love I have inside   And I'll give it all to you   My love (my love, my love).Hush my baby, sweetly sleep   Do not cry   I will sing a lullaby   I will rock you, rock you, rock you   I will rock you, rock you, rock you   Feel my arms that keep you warm   Snuggling around your tiny form   Precious baby, sweetly sleep   Sleep in peace   Sleep in comfort, slumber deep   I will rock you, rock you, rock you   I will rock you, rock you, rock you   Close your eyes my darling one   'Til the new day has begun   I will rock you, rock you, rock you   I will rock you, rock you, rock you   Sleep in peace 'til day has come   Darling, darling, little one.For example, just a sample?.There's an angel on a ribbon   Hanging from the armoire door   There's a Cupid with his feet crossed   On the bird cage by the door   There's a baby angel drummer      His eyes are open wide   And two more tiny cherubs   On the mantle side by side   Too many angels      Have seen me crying   Too many angels   Have heard you lying      There are photographs of children   All in their silver frames   On the window sills and tabletops   Lit by candle flames      And upon their angel faces   Life's expectations climb   Where the moment has preserved them   From the ravages of time      Too many angels   Have seen me crying   Too many angels   Have heard you lying      Bring the morning on   Voices sing of day   I want to step out in the morning sun   Through the flood of tears      I want this darkness gone   Your sweet face appears   These apparitions coming one by one   But there's no end in sight      Only the dead of night   And too many angels      Too many angels   Have seen me crying   Too many angels   Have heard you lying   Too many angels      Bring the morning on   Voices sing of day   I want to step out in the morning sun   Through the flood of tears      I want to greet the dawn   Cast away these fears   Forget about the things we could have done   Bring the morning on      Voices sing of day   I want to watch the children as they run   Through the broken years   I want this darkness gone      Your sweet face appears   These apparitions coming one by one   But there's no end in sight   Only the dead of night   And too many angels.I don't care if your love grows cold   Found love in someone else's home   Don't like standin' in the snow      Everything's turning to gold   Everything's turning to gold   Everything's turning to gold      You used to know me long ago   Was so lost and way down low..The setting and features affect the cyclist because with each building he hopes for water, but since he is traveling through a desert water is in limited supply and many empty buildings are left out in the wastland. These buildings create a feeling of releve in the cyclist anty to be followed by despair to find them abandoned. The land with no features also creates a feeling of lost hope in the rider making his entire ordeal that much harder. Over all it was an excureiatly experience physicly and mentaly for the cyclists."
"Oh, did I crack your shell?.He said, she said it's bad for the children,   He went and bought a gun..There will be some blood no doubt about it   But we'll come thru don't doubt it   I look into your eyes and I know you won't kill me   And I turn my back for I know you won't kill me   You won't kill me   You won't kill me no   But I wonder why   Yes, I wonder why sometimes      Putting on the black tie      Crankin up the white noise      They'll show us how to break the rules   But never how to make the rules   Reduce us down to witless punks   Black tie white noise   Facist cries both black and white, who's got the blood, who's got the gun..Oo baby, oo babe   I gotta go I gotta I gotta go I gotta medicine   I got I gotta do it again, wait a minute wait a minute   Hold on I'm not done..And oh, what a storm!.The principals of lust are easy to understand...   Do what you feel, feel until the end..Bells of freedom ring   Bells of freedom ring..The cyclist was affected majorly by a few dreadful parts of the setting. In the beginning, when it was not as hot and he had plenty of water, the cyclist was absolutely fine. As the day went on, he felt the heat bearing down on him. He drank all his water, and now he felt desperate. His mood changed with the setting, and he was extremely happy once he reached Gary and @ORGANIZATION1. Also, this cyclist decided to blame the old men for giving him bad directions when he was in trouble, but he thanked them once he realized they were correct."

The features of the setting affect the cyclist because real cyclist know what the speed is for a bike so you don’t need to tell them. If a cyclist needed some dierections they would go to a gas station not to some old person’s house. A real cyclist can go as long as they want before the stop because they are tired. A real cyclist knows haw to do tricks on a bike don’t have to do them over and over again to be able to do them. A real cyclist doesn’t have to train to go into a tourtement and win they must have to practice to be able to win."
"Death be my mistress, guns be my wife   Breath is my witness and roads are my life   Just give my future's clean as a knife   Far on the way from L.A..Well you can tell your other man, Sweet daddy's on his way..I am the god of fuck!.station   And good ole boys down at the park   The say ""Hey, Willie"" and those rock-a-billies   Made their way into my heart      I remember the old folks sittin' 'round talkin'   On laidback Sunday afternoons   They said them young folks sure got a hard road   Oh, they're growin' up too soon      Now I know they were right, and as I sit here tonight   Out on the front porch swing   The stars are shinin' in my young boy's eyes   Just like they did for me      We are leaning, leaning on   The everlasting arms of love   Livin' all those simple joys   This Dixie boy is made of      We are leaning, leaning on   The everlasting arms of love   Livin' all those simple joys   This Dixie boy is made of.I like it here - can I stay?.Don't need a Dictionary      (I said A) Bow chika bow wow, That's what my baby says!...The setting in “Rough Road Ahead: Do not exceed posted speed limit,” affected the cyclist greatly. For starters it says he was “traveling through the high desserts” which is never a safe thing. He had been drinking he water regularly but the temperature was rising. He was, “trying to keep balance in my dehydrated state.” From lack of water because the terrain had altered his water into “A far like substance” The setting of the story was cruel to the cyclist."

My inner ninja!.The people up top push the people down low..Is there anyone that sees what's going one?.The cyclist is affected by the change in terrain from flat to hilly, the elderly men’s directions and most importantly his thirst. He tries to save what little water he has left for time when he really needs it. He looks for a place to cool off and get water, which he finally does in the end. He’s also a little bit angry and disappointed of the old men’s directions. He’s really going a lot more miles then he should be according to the directionsand he's beginning to wonder if they’ve lost it. "

In the story is says, “The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips.” This means the cyclist was short on water and needed to find a town soon. Cycling in the desert and up down hills made it harder and hotter. The heart could cause dehydration or a heatstroke because it says, “and the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke” the buildings the cyclist did see were not any help to him because they had no water. Eventually he came to a fishing camp and found water in the sink of the bathroom. The story says, “I stumbled into a rather modern bathroom and drank deeply from the sink.” This is where the setting changes because the cyclist found cool water finally."

Joe @PERSON1 said, “There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind” (@PERSON1). After receiving bad directions from a few old men having people passing by in cars or near by stores would probably help the cyclist for asking directions. @PERSON1 said, ""working the handle of the rusted water pump with all my strength"" (@PERSON1). Having no water to replenish your body will make you weak and unstable. In the middle of no  where that is a problem. @PERSON1 also said, ""Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills” (@PERSON1). With little water left and a weak body it must have been hard going up and down those @NUM1 also said, “I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June” (@PERSON1). I dust in your lungs and heat from the sun as it becomes harder for your body to work."

The features of the setting affect the cycleist in many diferent ways. For example it was June and he was in the @CAPS1 of California. It was very hot and the dehydrated him. Also he did no know where he was going so he had to rely on other people directions. Also he had to keep dehydrate. That what affected the cycleist. "

All of these features act like obstacle courses, which makes it hard to do what he’s trying to do which is recieve water. Also, with the cyclist being hot and in need of water he at this point is delinous and most likely doesn’t know whats going on. In the story the authors main feature of the setting is the road. “Rough road ahead.”  This explains the cyclist having to go on a rough road, and doing that dehydrated is very dangerous these are some of the features of the setting that affect the cyclist.

On the way to the park, the cyclist had encountered the heat of the desert in California. Besides the heat the cyclist had to overcome the rough terrain of the of the short, rolling hills. This made the cyclist tired and weary. Adding to his weakness, and the extreme heat, he also ran out of water, causing him to become dehydrated. “Wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from a heat stroke...laugh.” This trip through the California desert greatly affected the cyclist by causing great exhaustion and dehydration."
"Is that all there is?.A pop singer..Oh, will you ever know how?.I had food in the fridge for a week..The whole darn world seemed upside down      The streets of town were paved with stars   It was such a romantic affair   And, as we kissed and said goodnight,   A nightingale sang in Berkley Square      The streets of town were paved with stars   It was such a romantic affair   And, as we kissed and said goodnight,   A nightingale sang in Berkley Square      I know 'cause I was there   That night in Berkley Square.I got lumps in my throat   When I saw her comin' down the aisle   I got the wiggles in my knees   When she looked at me and sweetly smiled   Well there she is again   Standin' over by the record machine   Well she looks like a model   On the cover of a magazine   But she's too cute   To be a minute over seventeen      Meanwhile I was thinkin'      Well if she's in the mood   No need to break it   I got the chance and I oughta take it   If she can dance we can make it   C'mon queenie let's shake it      I said go, go, go, little queenie   I said go, go, go, little queenie   I said go, go, go, little queenie      Won't someone tell me   Who's the queen standin' over by the record machine   Well she looks like a model   On the cover of a magazine   But she's too cute   To be a minute over seventeen      I said go, go, go, little queenie   I said go, go, go, little queenie   I said go, go, go, little queenie      Meanwhile, I was still thinkin', hmmmm,   Well if it's a slow one   We'll omit it   If it's a rocker, then we'll get it   If it's a good one, she'll admit it   C'mon queenie, let's get with it      [Repeat x6]   I said go, go, go, little queenie.Down through the ages men have died for women   And done so for many times   Each time I loved one, I've always lost one   Seems the right one is so hard to find      [Chorus:]   Shopping for dresses with no one to wear them   One in each color, one in each style   I'll find a lady someday to wear them   My shopping will be done for awhile      I'll bet somewhere's a lady shopping for britches   Comparing the value, appraising each pair   Maybe someday the Lord will bring us together   And we ll both have a new wardrobe to wear      Shopping for dresses with no one to wear them   One in each color and one in each style   Maybe someday if I'm lucky   I'll find someone to wear them   And my shopping will be done for awhile   My shopping will be done for awhile      I'm looking for a lady who'll look good in dresses   She must be red-headed, green eyes and be fair   I'll make exceptions to all my requirements   As long as she s willing to care      [Chorus:]      I just saw a beauty with blue eyes, what a cutie   Bond hair like a halo around her did flow   But the brunette beside her would be just as lovely   In the dresses I bought long ago      [Chorus:]      Now as I sit here dreaming, planning and scheming   Why should I make standards when everyone knows   As your need ranges, women make changes   And you must accept them or just let them go      [Chorus:].The features of the setting in the essay “Do not exceed the posted speed limit” affected the cyclist in a negative way. The more and more he rode, he thought more negatively and had alot of doubt. The cyclist was not very confident, he thought he wouldn’t make it. For example, when the cyclist notices nothing in sight, his tone changes. “There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind. I began breaking the ride down into distances I could see on the horizon telling myself that if I could make it that far , I’d be fine”. He seemed unsure and a little nervous. As the journey continued, the cyclist loses hope it seems. “It didn’t really matter. I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean leaving only some expensive outdoor gear and a diary” He does not see himself finishing this journey the more and more he rides in the middle of nowhere with nothing to be seen except “Rough Road Ahead” signs.

truce we ever came to   In our adolescent war   And I start to feel the fever   From the warm air through the screen   You come regular like seasons   Shadowing my dreams      And the Mississippi's mighty   But it starts in Minnesota   At a place that you could walk across   With five steps down   And I guess that's how you started   Like a pinprick to my heart   But at this point you rush right through me   And I start to drown      And there's not enough room   In this world for my pain   Signals cross and love gets lost   And time passed makes it plain   Of all my demon spirits   I need you the most   I'm in love with your ghost   I'm in love with your ghost      Dark and dangerous like a secret   That gets whispered in a hush   (don't tell a soul)   When I wake the things I dreamt about you   Last night make me blush   (don't tell a soul)   And you kiss me like a lover   Then you sting me like a viper   I go follow to the river   Play your memory like a piper      And I feel it like a sickness   How this love is killing me   I'd walk into the fingers   Of your fire willingly   And dance the edge of sanity   I've never been this close   I'm in love with your ghost      Unknowing captor   You never know how much you   Pierce my spirit   But I can't touch you   Can you hear it   A cry to be free   Oh I'm forever under lock and key   As you pass through me      Now I see your face before me   I would launch a thousand ships   To bring your heart back to my island   As the sand beneath me slips   As I burn up in your presence   And I know now how it feels   To be weakened like Achilles   With you always at my heels      This bitter pill I swallow   Is the silence that I keep   It poisons me I can't swim free   The river is too deep   Though I'm baptized by your touch   I am no worse than most   In love with your ghost      You are shadowing my dreams   (In love with your ghost)   (In love with your ghost)   (In love with your ghost).You didn't phone when you said you would!.Joined at the heart..Anytime you feel down-hearted,   That will prove your love for me is true!.The older men gave him directions that were acctully really bad. Nature wasn’t on is side that’s for sure. First of all he ran out of water because of the heat. Secondly a snake blocked his path and he didn’t want to tempt it. Thirdly he became so overheated that it was possible for him to suffer a heat stroke in the middle of nowhere. Also he kept going to abandoned buildings. It was so bad that the stone relied on for his thirst got stuck in his throat, he was then lead to a bait shop that was absolutely in the middle of nowhere and he had no way of getting home."
"we want some, we want some   All aboard For Fun Time   (Fun!).I can kill!.After all the lovin', baby,   We've had through the years..Stomp!.I'm in a hurry to get things done   Oh I rush and rush until life's no fun   All I really gotta do is live and die   But I'm in a hurry and don't know why..Well I worked hard and I got lots of money   Well I tried hard but I don't want to stay   Yeah I've seen too much trouble, I felt too much pressure bubble   I knew there had to be a better way      I wouldn't hide if you thought I was worth it   You'd smack me down when I misbehave   But everybody knows that I've got flunkies here in tow   To clean up all the messes that I've made      I'm going over the cliff   I'm going over the cliff   And it's hard to tell if life is a burden or a gift   Yeah I'm going over the cliff      Forgive me or forget me everybody   Well I guess I always had this honest streak   Yeah I'm sick of all the yawning, the bitching, and the bawling   I'm sick of feeling powerless and weak      Please don't call me cool just call me.Oh I, I just died in your arms.... The cyclist choose to take an old abandoned route to @LOCATION1. The route had in some places no buildings at all to see making the cyclist loss hope of his need for water. Until the end there was no one on the route making him all alone. So if something happen who would know. During his adventure he ran out of water making him dehydrated that didn’t help. The setting of the story seems tragic to the cyclist."

They effect the cyclist’s confidence, and hope. I say this because through out the story he sees things that would consern other people like the towns that are suppose to be the best end up “Ghost towns” and the road from flat to hills. Yet he continues on and then says “what I believed was my last burst of energy,” “I was going to die.” The cyclist dosent think he can continue but manages to keep going hoping that the next horizon to see a building or something. Hope saved his life because if he knew he could not continue that he could die."

One way the setting affected the cyclist way when it got hot and the rider was running out of water. another way the cyclist was affected by the setting was when he said he ""could die of heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June simply because of listened to some gentlemen who hadn’t been off their porch in decades caused me to laugh. a third way the cyclist was affected was was when he went inside the bait shop and cooled down. lastly when he rehydrated himself in the  so the setting was a main factory to the cyclist in the essay “Rough Road Ahead” by Joe kurmaskie on his way to Yosemite national park."
"If we burn our wings   Flying too close to the sun   If the moment of glory   Is over before it's begun   If the dream is won   Though everything is lost   We will pay the price,   But we will not count the cost      When the dust has cleared   And victory denied   A summit too lofty   River a little too wide   If we keep our pride   Though paradise is lost   We will pay the price,   But we will not count the cost      And if the music stops   There's only the sound of the rain   All the hope and glory   All the sacrifice in vain   And if love remains   Though everything is lost   We will pay the price,   But we will not count the cost.Let me tell you now this girl she's not mine   She ain't my baby, she ain't my girl      Why are you trying, trying to lie girl   When ain't I never met you at all   Saying goodbye, but how could ya   You throw this, you throw this   Your foolishness, seduces      Maria why you wanna do me like that?.One day I'll cange you'll be the fist one that I call..Born on the bayou   Born on the bayou   Born on the bayou..You're usin' a 286?.Now he's fadig away and i'm glad to say,   He's dying at last..Kim Kardashian Kanye West, amen   I eat Hova with nova, knishes with my bitches   A bagel and cream cheesy with my boy, his name is Weezy   Do not go to Feingold's, though   The pickles are rubber   And I will not be harmin' yah   I read the Old Testament, okra and matzahball, I'll eat the rest of it   I celebrate Hanukkah, dated Rihannakah   Birth right in Israel, mama from Canada   Daddy from Africa   Both of best worlds when you're Jewish with black in ya'   Challah!.The features of the setting affected the cyclist in many ways. Like he was in a desert, no one to give him good information, no towns close by that are still running, it was a hot summer day, no water near by. These affected the cyclist because they made him not sweaty, dry mouth, no energy, and he was having alot of doubt that he was not going to make his journey alive. In the story they cyclist said, ''I picked up some pebble and put them in my mouth. With my luer. I'd hit a bump and lodge one in my throat. It didn’t really matter. I was going to die. ''When he said that he showed alot of doubt. Everytime he got to a town or bulding it was abandoned. He saw an abandoned  building witch was ironically a Welch's Grape Juice factory and bottling plant. That made him even more thirstier. Thats how the features affected the cyclist."

The dry desert affected the cyclist because these was no water and the cyclist was dehydrated. The strong heat, because the cyclist could bare had a heat stroke. The animals because the snake could have killed the cyclist and these was no one in miles to help. In the story it says, “These was no one in sight, not a bulling, car or structure of any kind,” If the cyclist had needed help then the  cyclist could most likely have died. if I was the cyclist, I probably would have given up by then but I’m glad the cyclist didn`t. The features of the setting affected the cyclist because of the many things that could make happened to him."

The features of setting affect the cyclist in many ways. At first when he sees the tall pines and the river he is calm: and chilled out. But when he sees the abandoned “@PERSON1’s Grape Juice” factory he becomes desperate and thinks he is going to die out in the desert. A guy travels to @ORGANIZATION1 where he meets “old timers and the give him a “shortcut” to the park. He then goes on his bike to the park taking their “shortcut.” While traveling starts to run out of water and then he thinks he is going to die out in the desert. “It din’t really matter. I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean.” This quote means now that he is out in the desert he thinks he is going to die since he has no more water. This relates because he becomes desperate  for water because he is out in the desert in the midde of June."

For example, the cyclist was in California, which is an extremely hot place in the desert in June. These features made dehydration a more keen possibility. Another example, is paragraph ten. It explains how the rough road, tumbleweeds, and large snake made it hard for the cyclist to keep his balance without water. Also, the essay describes a building with a poster of a small child drinking a refreshing glass of juice,this made the cyclist think more about water and  become very thirsty. Although thier was some possitive effects of the setting on the cyclist. The pebbles aloud him to keep his mouth moist and not think so much of his thirst. Also, the bait shopped allowed him to opt something to drink, and not die from dehydration."

First of all he was in the desert on a bike! Which helped him dehydrate faster. Secondly, the ‘towns’ around the way  had been abandoned, leaving no place to get more water and no place to ask for directions. Lastly there were no other people around so if the cyclist was to get into trouble, he wouldn't be able to find help. "

He decides to follow the directions of coaple old men, which was a mistake.”…Simply because I listened to some gentlemen who hadn’t been off their porch in decades,”(Kurmaskie).

These factors greatly effected the cyclist. The hot weather was bad for the cyclist because he had a limited water supply.The text says, “The sun was beginning to beat down” (@NUM1). Showing the temperature was rising.  The text says, ""Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills"" (@NUM2). The author’s battery was leaking acid so it was harder to make it over the hills. Seems like everything went wrong for this man but he still made it."

I would say that this has a big effect on the cyclist since he dehydrates alot and is threatened with heatstroke. Also he had to ride careful past a huge snake which could have hurt him. Personally I don’t know what he was doing ride threw the dessert by himself, and that’s his problem."

It was hard arrived at the first town for author. For example “Rough Road Ahead: Do not Exceed Posted Speed Limit.” The road that author was ridding, it was rough. @CAPS1 example is “Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.” All the road was hills and rough. Than “The water bottle contained only a few tontalizing sips.” @CAPS1 doesn’t have that much water. That was really hard."

The cyclist has said that he had to ride over terrain that was smooth at first but then turned into rolling hills. He also had to find his way around a big snake while being dehydrated. The cyclist was mainly affected because he was out of water when he was riding on his bike through a desert like area, but because he was determined to reach water he made it through."

Many of these features affect him in a negative way. One such feature is the hills that are present in the essay. These probably exasperated the cyclist even more than he already was with the sun beating down on him. Another feature was the road sign that said “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” “The speed limit was @NUM1. I was doing a water-depleting @NUM2. Sometimes life can feel so cruel.” The author/cyclist probably felt like he would never make it. Also, the sign advertising grape juice probably made him feel life was even crueler with its sadistic irony. Finally, the bait shop offered much relief to the cyclist. “I had an overwhelming urge to seek out Gary and Wilber, kiss them, and buy some bait.” All in all, the setting affected the cyclist in some pretty bad ways until the end."

They say it is very hot and there is sand everywhere. There also aren’t many places to cool off at. They also described the water and Lodi to be about @NUM1 degree in temperature. The cyclist was trying to get to Yosemite to get away from the heat and to have a cool, shady pine trees to sit under, and cool fresh water. This affects the cyclist because he gets dehydrated because of the horrid heat."

For example, he said there was rusty water, and ""it tasted like battery acid"" because of this he was not able to drink it which made him become dehydrated. Also in the story is says, ""flat roads were replaced by short rolling hills."" This could of made the journey even harder for the cyclist because now he had a little more effort to get up the hills one more example is towards the end he says ""i began breaking my ride down into distances, i could see the horizon telling myself i could make it there."" By the cyclist saying this it seems like he has given up and he realizes that this journey is going to never end untill he dies. That is how the setting on the story affected the cyclist."

First in the essay when the @CAPS1 says he is in the deserts of California, that can affect because it gives them an idea of how hot it most likely was out there and how lack of water can really harm someone. Also when the @CAPS1 describes the water pumps and what comes out o them, it can give the cyclist a feeling of disgust and remind them to always keep a good water supply."

Because he was in the desert of California in June, he water supply was emicated and he came across a ghost town. His hope was dwindling because of this. He found a water pump that produced a tar like substance as a result the desert and the lack of water made him wish he was dead he decided never to take advice from strangers and to trust his map. That is how the feature affected the setting."

The cyclist traveled through the desert to get to his destination. He started to run out of water because it was so hot and humid. He started to get dehydrated and could bairly keep his balance. In this story the cyclist had to pass a large snake “a ridiculously large"" snake – it realy didn’t look like a diamondback – blocked a majority of the pavement in front of me “(Kurmaskie). The snake was big and the cyclist had to work his best to pass it while wobbling from dehydration. The settings in this story had effect on the cyclist in many ways."

They changed his hope to doubt. There were no buildings or cars, which led him to believe he would never get to Yosemite. Also, it had a rough terrain that made him doubt that he would ever get water. Im sure if the setting had buildings, people, even just civilization, then the cyclist would of been fine."

In this story the setting affects the cyclist in many ways. He tries to get directions but the people he asked really didnt know what they were talking about. Thats why you have to be careful on who you ask. Then he needs a drink but that dosent work out to well because the water ends up tasting like battery acid. Then the cyclist begins to be on his way again and finds same difficulty in the road. The same difficulty in the road. The road is in bad condition and must do slower then the speed limit. At this point it felt like he was gonna die. Lucky he found a bathroom and drank from the sink."

Through   hills, high desert, flat roads and the woods. This cyclist took the advice of bunch old men who thought they knew a short cut to the Yosemite national park. This short cut turned out to be a nightmare. The cyclist had only brought so many water bottles and was quickly drinking them all. The setting of this story changed a lot making the cyclist at   times have to pedal faster and slowes. The cyclist was quickly worn out and started to loose hope in himself. The  terrain kept changing making it  hard for him not to be thirsty. Eventually he drank all of his water and knew he would die of dehydration or a heat stroke. As he came up over a long hill he saw a bait store and stopped inside to have a drink vowed not to listen to a bunch of old guys again."

The cyclist had to endure the pain of dehydration and determination. He had been given bad directions that almost caused him his life. He was travelling through a desert and claimed the temperature was @NUM1.Also, the cyclist had to ration his water because it was ghost towns in which our character passed through. He used nature skills he’d once learned and began to suck on pebbles which take the mind off thirst and uses saliva to help refresh your throat. Throughout his adventure everything kept this young man from getting water and to whenever there was water any faster. He had survived and wouldn’t ever take shortcuts again"

At first, the rider “rode into the morning...with a smile” because of the bright sun, and the “cool pines” and rushing rivers”...he is very confident with the old mens directions, this first sign of disapointment is when he comes to the “ramshackle shed...” And the “...sight of this was troubling...” to him, but he rode on. He thinks as he rides over the “crippling hills” that maybe this wasn’t such a great idea. Finally he comes to a old bait shop, and the “modern bathroom” that he enters to drink from, gives him relief from the desert he had just been riding through."

First the cyclist followed the old codgers advice of how to get to Yosemite National Park. Their advice was no use and didnt help her in the end. Next, “a tarlike substance oozed out” of what she thoot was going to be water. Then the terrain changed to “short, rolling hills”, which wasnt helping, her bike better. Lastly, ""tumble weeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake”, slowed her down. All of these road blocks in the setting affected the cyclist."

Now, California is very hot during the summer, which is when the cyclist is riding. This setting greatly affects the man’s journey. It made it very difficult for him to finish his ride. He drank most of his water in the beginning of his ride so he gets very dehydrated. The text states, “The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips.” As you can see the setting makes this man’s bikeride very hard."

That’s when he realizes he could die from heatstroke because he listened to a bunch of old men."

Which caused him to get very thirsty and drink all his water. After almost all his water was gone, he began to get very tired, and since it is the desert, there isn’t any one around to help him if he dehydrates and blacks out, so he has to persevere and really push through the situation if he wants to survive. But he eventually finds a bait shop and he has a drink there so he is okay."

After taking advice from old people he ended up in the desert with no cars, buildings, or peopl. He was running low on water and had no way of getting anymore, and he was really dehydrated, he got really tired and almost gave up because of the heat and lack of water. All this was caused by the setting he was in."

At first, in the cyclist’s own words, “ things began well enough.” @CAPS1, this soon changes. The road is long and filled with obstacles and the cyclist has hardly any water to sip. He does not give up, @CAPS1, in the text it says, “got back on the bike, but not bothered gathered up a few peldder and stuck them in my mouth.” He does this in order to reduce his need for water and continues, ignoring the tall the setting brings upon him."

One way is he is round stuck with only a little bit of water. “The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips.(Kurmaskie). Also the cyclist was lost because of the old men directions that got him know where because there directions were out of date. “Never accept travel advice from a collection of old-timers who haven’t left the confine of their porches since carter was in office,” (Kurmaskie @NUM1). He was giving bad directions and wasnt to pleased. Therefore the cyclist went through some though times."

One way was the heat. It got so hot that he was becoming dehydrated. He kept drinking his water, until he didnt have any left. Another reason is because the road turned into hills which made him use more energy. Finally, it didn't help that he hadnt seen any sign of living creatures except for a snake @CAPS1 how the setting affected the cyclist."

The desert just made him want water even more. That are some features of the settings that affected the cyclist."

Many things in the setting affect the cyclist. The first thing that affects him is the heat. The heat is actually what causes the conflict in the story of the cyclist needing water. If the heat was not present in the story than the cyclist would not have such a need for water and he would be able to continue on his ride without fear of dehydration. Another aspect of the setting that affect the cyclist are the rolling hills. These hills also exhaust the cyclist and cause him to need more water. If these hills were gone than the cyclist would have tirerd less quickly making his journey easyer. The setting in this story greatly affects the cyclist."

Also, the hot aiR can dehydRate him, which can cause him to pass out. Along with the dRy aiR, theRe is dRy land, which means theRe is no place to stop foR wateR oR take a @CAPS1. The Rough @CAPS2 make the biking naRaeR because it involves moRe eneRgy than biking on a smooth path. Finally, the snake in the  middle of the Road made it haved foR the bikeR to go aRound. If the snake would have bitten him he could have died fRom poison."

There’re insidents that are a problem. One is the bad weather. There is a tempature that makes it feels pretty close to @NUM1 degrees. He stops at a water pump, water comes out but it is really not cool. He takes two little sips and its like battarey acid. If he would to drink alot of that water it would probably kill him or make him very ill. He needs something because there was another town @NUM2 miles down the road so he has to find something to keep him going. As he is going down the road he sees a sign: Rough Road Ahead: Even though he is going 12 mph he could still hit a hole and go flying over his handle bars. If he does go over his handle bars he could run into the snake he saw then get eaten by the birds because he wouldn’t have any energic to get up. There’re some interesting sence in the story."

As the cyclist was driving through the desert, he noticed how hot it was, and how he would become dehydrated quickley. I was also very dry and and he started to get nervous about how thirsty he was. The flat ground models how there is nothing around that can help the cyclist, which made him scared. The story also metions that he is a ghost town"

For example, in the essay it said at some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculous large snake blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me when I think of tumbleweeds I think of dryness because it is like dry grass and when I think of snakes I think of heat because that is the time for snakes to come out when ot gets hot. So the cyclist was thinking about dryness of his throat and the dryness of his sorrounding making him want water. Another feature is when he seen a sandblasted picture of a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth probably making the cyclist wishing he could have that cold refreshing drink."

At first, there were the two old men who gave the cyclist the out-of-date information. They affected him negatively because if it wasn’t for them, the cyclist would have never gotten lost. When the cyclist arrived at the first town, the water pump affected him, the cyclist was running out of water and the water from the water pump tasted like battery acid and was about @NUM1°. The cyclist was becoming more and more dehydrated and the small, rolling hills didn’t help his dehydration, he also used a lot of energy in order to go over the hills. Finally, he found Gary and Wilber’s fish camp where he was able to get water. This whole experience in a way, affected the cyclist positively even though, at the time, he was affected negatively. The cyclist learned to not take advice from really old people who “haven’t left the confines of their porches since Carter was in office.” The cyclist was affected positively and negatively by the features of the setting."

When starting the journey he had very little water. Because it was hot and dry his water went quickly leaving him very little water for the rest of the trip. The ragh roads also made him, tired making it harder to make the journey."

For example, if it is hot outside then he would need more water than normal. Also if it was raining he would have to drive more careful. That is why the setting would affect the cyclist."

The cyclist, said the old men looked as though they, “haven’t left the confines of their poaches since carter was in office. “  Well, he takes their advice, and he gets lost about @NUM1 along on his journey. While looking forward to the “Cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite”’ he was traveling through a barren desert. “There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind.” This type of setting could really bring down a cultist’s mood while thinking of Yosemite.

"[Intro]   Yeah I wanna dedicate this to everybody that love hip hop music   Cause without hip hop music I wouldn't be here today   Preacher's son, yeah      [Verse 1]   Imagine if Biggie and Pac never got shot   And they both still were rulers of hip hop   And Puffy and Suge was roomates from college   And Big L never got found in the alley   Nas and Jay-Z they were still homies   Squash the beef with Ja Rule and 50   Benzino shook hands with Eminem   And on the same record I heard Eve, Fox and Kim   And sometimes when I dream, that's when I wake up   I kinda hoped that The Fugees didn't break up   And when they walked into the studio I prayed they didn't spray   Cause I miss that scratch from Jam Master Jay (Whoa oh oh!!!).Here..Silver rain was falling down   Upon the dirty ground of London town..[Dial tone]   [Mr Spindel:] ""Hullo!"".I was staring out the window   The whole time he was talking to me   It was a filthy pane of glass   I couldn't get a clear view      As he went on and on   It wasn't the outside world I could see   Just the filthy pane that I was looking through      So I had to break the window   It just had to be   Better that I break the window   Than him or her or me      I was never focused on just one thing   My eyes got fixed when my mind got soft   It may looked like I'm concentrated on a very clear view      But I'm as good as asleep   I bet you didn't know   It takes a lot of it away if you do      So I had to break the window   It just had to be   Better that I break the window   Than him or her or me      So I had to break the window   It just had to be   Better that I break the window   Than him or her or me      Because the fact in fact   Whatever's in front of me is covering my view   So I can't see what I'm seeing in fact   I only see what I'm looking through      I had to break the window   It just had to be it was in my way   Better that I break the window   Then forget what I had to say      So again I've done the right thing   I was never worried about that   The answer's always been in clear view   But even when the window's clean   I still can't see for the fact   That when it's clean it's so clear   I can't tell what I'm looking through      So I had to break the window   It just had to be   Better that I break the window   Than him or her or me      I had to break the window   It just had to be it was in my way   Better that I break the window   Then forget what I had to say      I had to break the window   It was in my way   Better that I break a window   Then forget what I had to say      Or miss what I should see   Or breaking him or her or me.Freedom, Freedom, Who's Chariot?.The more I see you as years go by   I know the only one for me can only be you   My arms won't free you, my heart won't try      I know the only one for me can only be you   My arms won't free you, my heart won't try.In the towns that the cyclist arrived at were all ghost towns. In the text, the author said, “it fit the traditional definition of a ghost town.” It affected the cyclist because, with the towns being deserted, the cyclist couldn’t refill hi water."
"Don't cry, Joe, let her go, let her go, let her go..There they are,   Shining bright..Walk with my eyes closed   I bump my head   Look at the stars falling on the ground   Saw someone crawling underneath my bed   Looked in the mirror caught my reflection, said oh...

I would never have asked old people, he should have ask someone that was in charge of a store, because those people get asked many times. also he could have died if that snake got him or from what he said “heatroke.”"

The features of the setting affects the cyclist because he knows he’s in the wrong area. The cyclist understand's that he should have never took that advice from them old men. So he was upset and new he should have taken his advise. The cyclist had a feeling that he wasn’t supposed to take it that way he said he shouldn’t have let them take a peek at his map. So the features really affect him."
"Now baby how can I commence you,   I'll make it so you can't resist,   Whatever else you have to do now,   It can't be half as good as this,   I'll case you underneath the sheets, love,   And I won't let you get away,   The day won't be complete, love,   Unless we get a chance to say,      [Chorus]      Open your eyes,   See my sunrise,   I feel your skin   So warm inside,   Day breaks so sweet,   When you're next to me,   So stay each night,   So each morning will be      [Chorus]      Let's get lost together,   I will smile forever [Repeat: x2]   Was morning.Listen up!.Yes, I'm lost without your love..As I was walking down the street one day   A man came up to me and asked me what the time was that was   On my watch, yeah   And I said   Does anybody really know what time it is   I don't   Does anybody really care   Care   If so I can't imagine why   About time   We've all got time enough to cry   Oh no, no      And I was walking down the street one day   A pretty lady looked at me and said her diamond watch had   Stopped cold dead   And I said   Does anybody really know what time it is   I don't   Does anybody really care   Care   If so I can't imagine why   About time   We've all got time enough to cry   Oh no, no      And I was walking down the street one day   Being pushed and shoved by people trying to beat the clock,   Oh, so I just don't know,   I just don't know   And I said, yes I said      People runnin' everywhere   Don't know the way to go   Don't know where I am   Can't see past the next step   Don't have to think past the last mile   Have no time to look around   Just run around, run around and think why      Does anybody really know what time it is   I don't   Does anybody really care   Care   If so I can't imagine why   About time   We've all got time enough to die   Oh no, no.Let's see action, let's see people,   Let's see freedom up in the air,   Let's see action, let's see people,   Let's be free, let's see who cares..!.He's the wrong kind of paradise..Each area the author entered changed what he felt and experienced. At first, he is lent courage by his surroundings. When he passes through the first town, abandoned and empty, he is still confidant he can go on sparred by the lush green trees and the cool rivers around him that belied the hot sun overhead. They are basically the reason he continued to go on. Later on during his trek through the desolated empty desert, his bleak surroundings make him feel hopelessness as well as despair. Even in the small details, such as the ghost town or the pump, this is ploven, as the ghost town brings him the first vestige of despair, and the useless pump only amplifys it. The scenario and scenery reflect and alter the authors mood throughout the story."

For example in the beginning he started out with a nice smooth ride. But it was very hot. Then he began to get into a hort rolling hills which were taking thier toll on his legs. Then we entered into a rough are where he had to be more careful. The roughness prolly wore him out from all the bumps and bounces. He went through a lot on that bike trip, who know he @MONTH1 have never made at back to where he was staying."

One page @NUM1 paragraph @NUM2 there is a sign that states rough road a head. One page @NUM1 paragraph @NUM4 it says ""over the long onpiling hill.” He also the tempature as started on page @NUM5 and at the top of page @NUM1 paragraph @NUM7 “ l was travling in hing desertd of california in June. These conditions of the setting all effect the cyclist."
"And if you think you're gonna lose   Well, you're probably gonna lose   So what's the point in trying anymore?.Live all you people, you can't see where you're at,   It doesn't really hurt you, so that can't be bad..How can I leave you, baby, leave you?.Through April rain the man goes down to watch the birds   Come in to share the summer   The man of May stands very still to watch the children   Dance away the day   In June the man inside the man is young and wants to   Lend a hand   And smiles at each new comer.."",   And the band played on..I read some old love letters right up to the break of dawn....The features of the setting affect the cyclist by dehydrating him. The cyclist said, “I toiled on. At some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake."" The cyclist was in the desert and each mile he rode he became more and more dehydrated.  The desert sun drying out his body. He said with each passing landmark, “I eased past trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state.”  @CAPS1 that the more he went on the more the desert affected him and dehydrated him."
"I want a love that's right   Right is only half of what's wrong   I want a short-haired girl   Who sometimes wears it twice as long   Now I'm stepping out this old brown shoe   Oh, baby I'm in love with you   So glad you came here   It won't be the same now I'm telling you   You know you picked me up   From where some try to drag me down   And when I see your smile   Replacing every thoughtless frown   Got me escaping from the zoo   Oh, baby I'm in love with you   So glad you came here   It won't be the same now I'm telling you   If I'll grow up I'll be a singer   Wear rings on every finger   Not worrying what they or you say   Live and love and maybe someday   Who knows baby you may comfort me, yeah   I may appear to be imperfect   But my love is something you can't reject   Changing faster than the weather   You and me should get together   Who knows baby you may comfort me   I want the love of yours   To miss that love is something I'd hate   I'll make an early start   I'm making sure that I'm not late   For your sweet tough lip I'm in the queue   Oh, baby I'm in love with you   So glad you came here   It won't be the same now I'm telling you   So glad you came here   It won't be the same now I'm telling you   So glad you came here   It won't be the same now when I'm with you, oh yeah, yeah   do-dai, do do-dai   Do-dai, do do-dai   Do-dai, do do-dai   Do-dai, do do-dai.Open your mind..Never was a smart kid, never knew a good thing..Another law I heard got passed today,   Someone's trying to take my rights away..Erika (speaking)-   No, I work at Madame Carp's penitentiary..You'd better move away,   You're standin' too close to the flame..(so tired)   And I'm tired of being nice (so nice)   Can't ya look me in the eyes?.There were many land features that affected the cyclist and his trip. First of all, it is a desert, which greatly affects him as there is no water in deserts. There was also a snake, which could have bit and kiiled him. As the road were not very well paved and had obviously been abandoned for years it made cycling much harder for him. And the juice factory just taunted him, making him remember his need for water, as did the well that did not pump cold water, but instead pumped hot,gross water"

The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. One of the ways are that it is affecting him is that the discription of it makes it seem hotter then what it really is. He says “neihbor hood of two hundred degrees.” He is saying that it is really hot. The features of the setting affected him because I mad it seem hoter and he was taking it to far."

And getting back on the road to go where ever he is trying to go at. But the only thing is that he didn’t never say anything about getting his bait for the fish. Also, cyclist was all so affected because he almost died from thirst and no road."

One very important part that affected the cyclist greatly is the fact that he was in a deserts without a good supply of water. Another part of the setting that challenged the cyclist was the length of his journey. Those two factors of his journey to Yosemite combined are probably the worst and most challenging things that affected the cyclist."

In the story the features of the setting effect him because he was running out of water. He also had to manuver around a snake. It made him tired and dehydratied. His muscles got sore from the rough terrain. He got dehydratied from the sun."

Ranging from temperature, surroundings, and the availability of water. First of all, the cyclist felt tired and exhausted because of the temperature and terrain, For example, “I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.” I can imagine the cruelty of the heat beating down on him while riding down the roads. It would make me tired and exhausted also. Second of all, the surroundings as he rode affected him and made him have less confidence as he rode further. For example, “This place might have been a thriving little spetatore time say, before the last world war-last on that morning it fit the traditional definition of a ghost town.” It shows how the information he had been giving caused him to feel unsure of where he was going. I’d feel uncapable and would do the same in his situation. Lastly, the lack of water made him scared. For example, “conserve my water and go instead for an hour or so a lest of my inner spirit.” It made him think the situation wasn’t good. So as one can see, it affected the cyclist in many ways."
"Is that ya girlfriend peepin' me out?.Baby jus look into my eyes   Now doesn't it feels nice   To express how I love you..Yes I ask you very confidentially,   Ain't she sweet?.Without friction there's no heat   WIthout heat there's no fire   Without fire there's no desire   You're making me hot, hot, hot, hot!.There's a whale outta water   Whoaaaa......Jimmy: It's always on time for Margarita ville..blue windows!. The features affects the setting of the cyclist because in some ways they through you off a little with others lines and then will get confused of what their acually talking about. The littlest thing that could through you off is the line when it says before the last world war. That kind off through me off alittle."

He has lack of water for a significant distance before he realizes “that the old men would have been right,had he been riding,” before the last word war.” But any “town” he rode into, was just a run down, deserted, and abandoned piece of desert. He says,“It was a sad, hopeless, laugh, mind you, but at leas I still had the energy to feel sorry for myself.” @CAPS1 that he was getting more and more dehydrated, but was not quite ready to die. He still had enough energy to keep going, But “hope was fading.” Then all at once after climbing a large hill he gains all hope back. He sees “Gary and Wilber’s fish camp” The rider is safe now, he stumbles into the modern looking bathroom and drinks from the sink. He is now safe, ready to ride, and avoid all men who haven’t moved from their front porches in years."

The setting is a dessert so by common knowledge you know that it is going to be hot and dry. Because it is hot the cyclist needs more water because he is getting dehydrated. And when he is on his low of water because it is dry into mouth gets drys. @CAPS2 because he is in the dessert he sees wild sometime dangerous animals, in the story he sees a ridiculously @CAPS1 diamondbrock snake, which I believe are venomous, @CAPS2 ‘because ‘ of the extreme heat of the dessert he realizes that he had ??? chance of dropping from heatstroke. @CAPS2 the writer said that the dessert had short rolling hills and rough road ahead ??? would leave worn the cyclist out. Because of this terrain the cyclist way affects."
"A hubba-hubba-hubba, well give me some skin!.La la la la la la la      I don't care what you do late at night..I thought I'd give my love to anyone today   But when it came to you one thing was for sure   Well I know your little games and I don't want to play   It's like takin' sick when nobody knows the cure   You come on like the princess of the junior prom   Always part of everything that's going down   Just looking for another fool to lean upon   In the center ring and everyone's your clown      Can't you see I've lost my nerve   I just can't face you   Perhaps I'll let the time erase you   Can't you see I've lost my nerve   I just can't face you   Perhaps I'll let the time erase you      I thought I'd give my love to anyone today   But when it came to you one thing was for sure   Well I know your little games and I don't want to play   It's like takin' sick when nobody knows the cure.Izabella   Girl, I dream about you every night   Every night   Hey, girl you know we got a war   Got a war to fight   So I think about you every day   Oh, and I hope you listen to me right      Hey, Izabella   Girl, I'm fighting this war for the you   Hey little girl I fight this war for the children and the world and you   So I hope you hear me baby, yeah   Cause what I try to tell you is true   Hey      Izabella   I fight this war for the children and you   Hey girl, I said I fight this war for the children and you   Please save your love for me   Then I'll know the fightin' is true   Izabella   Hey   Izabella   I'm gonna fight this war against nature, my heart.No one hears me call,   Echoes back at me   No ones there..The rest is history..I will go Lord, if You lead me.. The setting effects the cyclist because he is in the desert with no water and doesnt know where he is going. The old men on the porch gave him wrong directions now he is lost in the desert. The cyclist find the will power to keep on moving and he finds help along the way. He finds another old man there that offer him directions but he says he has a map"

Such as the water. He had no really good water to drink because of where he was''. When I tryed a drop or two, it had the flavor of battery acid''. He wasnt able to drink the water because the battery acid'' that was in it could have made him very sick. Also the unstable roads that he had to bike through made things hard. ''Rough roads ahead'' To ride on unstable ground can be very hard to do. So just these two examples, the water and Rough roads made the features of the setting deffinitly effect the cyclist."
"Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, like an American..No, there ain't no heroes here   No, no   Haven't I seen you here before?.Whatever you've got..(mick, I've got a...)

The setting affects the cyclist in many ways. The setting affects the cyclist because the weather is very hot and humid which makes him sweat which is using up energy because his body is trying to stay cool. Also the setting affects the cyclist because there is no water so on top of sweating being out of energy he has no water to refuel his body which makes it very hard for him to keep going."

So yes the author is affected by the setting"

The affects of the features around them affect them by the hot bikes so the bikers need water and also it affects them by the roads are so hill so they can’t just road. Stight so they need to go over the hilles and that affects them because cycles are very hard to land form a jump."

One, if the setting is nice, the rider can concentrate on the scenery not on only pain they are having. also, if the setting isn’t very nice, the rider would probably concentrate more on the pain than they would the scenery. another thing is if the setting is very hilly & the rider has to drive over it, it @MONTH1 not feel the greatest. The cyclist would get even more pain than before plus the cyclist could could get dehydrated faster, the setting really does affect the cyclist."

It tells you that the setting is abandoned when if says “there was none in sight, not a building, car or structure of any kind"". This would make it hard for a cycler because you need a good water supply and thats hard to keep when there is nothing around."
"You took advantage of an outreached hand   And twisted it to meet your every need   ""Gimme time to recharge my batteries,   I'll see her when she's older   And I'll bounce her on my knee""      Well listen to me you ungrateful fool,   Here comes a dose of reality..By the hum, hum of your humming bird heart..Well, that's a hobo's lullaby.No matter where you are in the world,   You're still my boys and you're still my girls,   And my love goes with you,   Wherever you roam..Love is blindness   I don't want to see   Won't you wrap the night   Around me?.They throw us into flames,      Did not hear our cries..The automobile   Seal of rubber wheel   Such inventive zeal   Still there's plenty to reveal..There are many ways that the setting affected the cyclist. One way is in the story when it says that it was very hot, he could become dehydrated and could possibly have a heat stroke, also the rodes were windy. This could be a problem because hes tired so he might not be able to go around the turns, he might just keep going straight and then get lost even more. That is all about how the features of the setting affect the cyclist in the story."
"Talk to me, don't be shy,   Heaven knows I really try to love you,   I try to love you, yeah..I've been fragile for a long time   A big old hole inside my heart   And I was searching through the valley   Stumbled on love in the dark      Was afraid to try but afraid to never know   What it feels like to be loved   Had a hill to climb   But the places we could go   Oh, I gotta know      So if we ever, fell in love   Would the wind blow, would the pain go, oh   So if we ever, fell in love   Oh, oh, oh      I was empty, it was all gone   The birds would sing but made no sound   Till I met you, found I was all wrong   You picked me up right off the ground      Was afraid to try, and afraid I'd fall again   Crashing down from the sky, you know   Had a hill to climb, but with you my heart wont mend   That's the one thing, we all wanna know      So if we ever, fell in love   Would the wind blow, would the pain go, oh   So if we ever fell in love   Oh, oh, oh      I just wanna know, I just wanna know   Tell me tell me so, baby I just wanna know      I just wanna know, I just wanna know   Tell me tell me so, baby I just wanna know      I just wanna know, I just wanna know   Tell me tell me so, baby I just wanna know      I just wanna know, I just wanna know   Tell me tell me so, baby I just wanna know      So if we ever fell in love   Would the wind blow, would the pain go, oh   (Yeah) So if we ever fell in love   Oh, oh, oh      So if we ever fell in love   Oh, I wanna know what it feels like to be loved.I'm afraid of the dark now,   It's the sign of a patsy,   Round the time of the door brow,   We should let it come in,      Never put your face in the water,   It hurts your eyes when they open up,   Not that any different could matter,   It's just a different conspirit..Yes we do..But if it's true,   Why do I love you?.Say goodbye, you're,   Sickeningly beautiful..Where have you been?.The setting affects the cyclist in a large way. He has a hard time going on his journey. He began to lose hope, get tired, and began to think he was going to die. The settings played the biggest role. It was very hot with no people or buildings around him. He had very little water and no place to get anymore. He then encountered a large snake which made it worse because he was in fear with no one around to help him. If he would have followed his own directions instead of the old men he would not have had this problem. The setting around him really made his trip a hard one with no water, people, towns, or buildings around him."

If the weatheris too hot then the cyclist might slow down because of the sun beating down on them. If its too cold, the cyclist puts on more clothes which might weigh them down from achieving the speed they need to obtain. The bike has to be stable. Riding on rough roads, braking, speeding, chains in good conditions. The area were the cyclists rides sets the mood. If its a nice scenary the cyclist might be in a wonderful mood as to the scenary being dark and gloomy with nasty weather behind it the cyclist might not be as happy as they could be. These typess of things @MONTH1 help determine how settings can affect the cyclist."

from the parade   It took a whole lot of years and tears   For her momma to finally admit   No matter how many stitches and pins   That old dress was never gonna fit      She was daddy's little girl   Momma's little angel   Teacher's pet, pageant queen   She said ""All my life I've been pleasin' everyone but me,   Living someone else's dream""      Her daddy used to say, ""You'll make a lovely

lala..The features of the setting effect the cyclist in many ways. The scenery makes the cyclist turn worried, unconfident, and in the end an ironic hopeful. The cyclist came upon the first “town”, and described it as only having “one ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corrall” I believe this is when the cyclist realized the men were a little off, and began to worry: he also couldn’t refill water supply, so fear of dehydration also kicked in already tired, the cyclist became unconfident when he came upon the sign reading, “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit”. Knowing that this was going to be a long and slow journey, the cycles becomes unconfident that he can make it, finally, when passing the sign saying, ""Gary and Wilber's fish camp – If you want bait for the big ones, we’ve your best bet,"" the cyclist reached a hopeful stage, because he knew he had found civilization once again. I believe your atmosphere and surroundings can effect your general mood, and that stands true today with the cyclist."
"To hum out loud those tunes   That his fiddle howed..Isn't she precious, less than one minute old,   I never thought through love you'll be   Making love as lovely as she..It's all for you..I watched the shadow of her body on the wall   As she slowly moved across the room..And I promise you never...   Will you hurt anymore..There she stood in the doorway,   I heard the mission bell..Is it true that perfect love drives out all fear?.The setting affects the cyclist becuse it is the passes is on a road much alot of hills it would affect him as being tired, or if the biter was in a place where the cold or hot it would affect him or his temp. and by his attiude."
"Running away....Now when I tell you to shout I want you to jump at it..Be still (we're still!).I have a plan, a big plan   I'll build you a house   Every stone is a tear and you will never move out   Yes, I'll build a little house for you, has no windows, no door   Inside it is dark and no light penetrates within   Yes, I'll make you a home and there you shall spend all your time      Stone by stone, I build you in   Stone by stone, I will always be with you      Without clothes, without shoes, you watch me at my work   With feet in cement you improve the appearance of the foundation   There will be a garden outside and nobody hears you screaming      Stone by stone, I build you in   Stone by stone, I will always be with you      What a beating, what a hammering outdoors it catches in to dawn   All nails stand to attention if I put them in your body, wood ramming      Stone by stone, I build you in   Stone by stone And no one hears you scream.Doc, there's a hole where something was..She put me in the doghouse,   Doghouse, doghouse,   I'm living in the doghouse,   Doghouse, doghouse,   Doghouse, doghouse.. The setting of where cyclsit takes there journey effects the cyclist. The reason I say that is because in the story “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” the cyclsit came upon a conflict with the setting. The conflict waas it was very hot and he did not use little things to survive witch he did. These are the reason why I say the setting of where cyclsit takes their journey matters."
"Are we closer to God than the ants and the flies?.A lover of women he can't hardly stand   He trembles he's bent and he's broken   I've fallen it's true but I say unto you   Hold your tongues until after I've spoken      I was takin' my pride in the pleasures I'd known   I laughed and thought I'd be forgiven   But my laughter turned 'round eyes blazing and   Said my friend, we're holdin' a wedding   I buried my face but it spoke once again   The night to the day we're a bindin'   And now the dark air is like fire on my skin   And even the moonlight is blinding.Left, right, don't get uptight..180!.Na na na na na...      You gotta know how to pony   Like Mony Baronie..You look like you got Spanish blood..But I'll be the smartest dead guy.. The cyclist was affected by long hours of riding the bike into the areas where he never been."
"Are you here?.(yeah)      I'll ride where the wind wants to take me   Leaving lovers in the dust every city   Cause my heart was like a ghost town baby   And now I met a man that brings me      I'm a bullet and I'm headed   Straight for you heart (yeah)   Be careful what you start!.And cause discontent until They,   Ceasing their investigation,   Bring back the days events,   Good citizens and time well spent,   Til we're talking in whispers again..In the name of love   Before you break my heart   Think it over   Think it over      I've tried so hard, hard to be patient   Hoping you'd stop this infatuation   But each time you are together   I'm so afraid I'll be losing you forever   Stop!.Seems to me like the days are getting longer   For everyone there's no fun when there's no time to sleep   Working on and on for a day in the sun   Counting down the days to it stops (every day)   Can you hear us?.(Clap, clap, clap, clap, clap)   (Clap, clap, clap, clap, clap)   (Clap, clap, clap, clap, clap)   And Bingo was his name-o!.I'm hoping you can feel me.. In the essay rough road ahead the setting does effect the cyclist because he has been pedaling for so long and he is becoming dehydrated “I had been hitting my watter bottles pretty regularly. I was in the @LOCATION1”. Another reason the setting effects him is because he is starting to see mirages “A sandblasted picture of a boy pouring a refreshing glass of grape juice into his mouth could still be seen."

The setting affect the cyclist in ways such as weather, road structure, & animals. All things that the cyclist could not controll. Therefor affecting the cyclist while he rides through."
"Now, how many nights can the full moon shine?.Why you want to make me cry?.(chorus)   Love is all is alright   But you left it a little to late   Love is all is alright   But you've got to find a little more hate..Tomorrow finally found me..Oh, Carol!.We can live our life   (embrace, embrace)   With our separate lives..(now baby tell what you wanna do with me). The features in the setting would affect the cyclist because they would want to have towns with water so they can restock they’re water. They would want water even more after going up hills. They would also want a palce to gey something to eat and maybe rest."

The feature of the setting affects the cyclist because of the heat and had know water. Also how rough the road ahead was. Another problem was the dry air and snakes laying out everywhere in the desert. Also the hills were a big problem to because of the heat and know water. Finally the other problem was he knew he was going to die and the birds would eat at him and their would be nothing left of him. This is how the setting affected the cyclist."

First, they go over a bunch of rocks, and the tire could poys. Next it could be smooth and easy. Also, it could be far away from towns and difficult to get back. There could be a lack of water making you dehydrate. That is how the setting around the cyclist could effect him."

The features of the setting of were the cyclist are affect them very drastically. They need a water supply and if they don’t have one they might dehydrate or even die. They need shade trees because it keeps the sun from beaming down on them so hard. They also need to cycle when its not as hot outside so that just incase there water gets low there is a better chance of survival. It would be great if there was someone with you to help if you get hurt. There should be buildings near by just incase of an emergency. It might even be good to carry a cell phone."

In this story, the setting is out in nowhere wit no water, and all he can see is roads. This affects the cyclist because he is hungry, thirsty,and now he's about to go down a really steep hill with fear of crashing and seriously insuring himself with noone around to get help from the setting of nowhere affects the cyclist in this story."

In the text it says, ''Never accept travel advice, from a collection of old timers who haven’t left the confines of their porches since carter was in the office,” this means that the cyclist did not have good directions. Because the road might of changed and the old timers do not know because they been sitting on there porches all the time. The is why I think the salling affects the cyclist."

It made him become dehydrated. For example, in paragraph @NUM1 sentence @NUM2 he stated “I eased past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state.” This shows how the heat and climate of the setting affected him by how he was getting thrown off balance and wears     to him getting dehydrated. The setting of the story “Do not exceed posted speed limit,” by Joe Kurmaskie, effects the cyclist in the story."

Two of the biggest setting in this story is the desert and rolling hills. This would effect the rider becaus of the dehydration that he would experience. Being in the desert would make it obviously hot so you sweat alot and the hills would make it tough on your body because you put extrat strain to get up them. So all together this would be a hard bike ride."

The cyclist starts at a town and his working his way to Yosemite when he decides to listen to a group of old men. He started out strong until he got to the first town, which was totally abandoned. He kept going to another abandoned town. He decided to keep going until he saw a sign. The terrain was a lot diffrent with rolling hills and tumbleweed rolling by and a snake. Through listening to the old men the cyclist almost died from the threatening heat and lack of water. The setting affected the cyclist even more seriously than he could have imagined."

The features of the setting affect the cyclist. The winding road could affect his turns because he could turn to far one way and fall off his bike and get hurt real bad. Another feature that could affect the cyclist is grass on both sides of the road. If he tireds to take a short-cut and goes into the grass he could he could hit a rock and flip off his bike and get hurt. That is what the feature of the setting could affect the cyclist."

At one point flowed by blackish watter feeling somewhere in the neighbor of two hundred degrees.. weather wouldn’t cool down."

The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. For example the lack of water begins to take a toll of how fast he can get to the next town. Another example would be the terrain only slows him down more."

I also know that it’s hot because he is swreating and dehydrated."
