Starting off on a warm day with the sun bright start off as a good thing, while his mood is still fresh and happy expressions play on his face. But as he moves on he speaks of how “The sun was beginning to beat down” expressing his remorse of listening to the old men that led him on their “shortcut.” Along the road he comes to his first let-down, a ghost town with “one ramshackle shop, several rusty pumps and a corral that couldn’t hold the lamest male.” @CAPS1 he tries to pump the water from the corral but gets a “battery-acid” flavor and is forced to continue onward with little left to drink.

These changes in terrain played into the fact that the weather did not cooperate. The hills made the cyclist work harder therefore use more energy. Luckily the terrain had a positive affect on the cyclist as well. The stones he found on the ground, helped keep his mind off the thirst. There were many factors of the setting that negatively and positively affected the cyclist throughout his adventure."

The more the cyclist noticedthe sun the more he drank untill his water supply seemed low, striping as an old rusty water pump he had hope of being replenished but the taste of bitter battery acid caused the cyclist to stop drinking. The rolling hills, Sun and tumbleweds did nothing to quech the cyclist thirst or at least divert his assertion. If the cyclists was to see a sign that said Yosemite @NUM1 miles away his spirits would have risen, instead he saw a sign that said, ”Rough Road Ahead” which did nothing to help him.

There were not many structures on the way. Either that, of the towns said to be, “a ghost town.” @CAPS1 this couldn’t have reassured the author that things were going his way. It also was very hot during his journey. The author says he is “traveling through the deserts of California in June.” Deserts are very hot places and June is during summer which is the hottest month so it had to have been extremely hot and humid. @CAPS1 all this must have taken a toll because he never really saw anything reassuring until the last town he reached with the bait store. So the setting definitely had to have affected his confidence and his energy levels."

Seeing this just crushes his spirit. @CAPS1 riding hills hard, but ridding hills with our knowing of something good waiting for you on the other side of the hills. Both of these, very different settings gives off very different feeling. The first one makes you think he is going to have as easy enjoy able bike ride. But this all changes when he hit those horrible hills. Just the thought of having so ride over miles of hills, makes your legs hurt.

His happiness is found in the first part of the quote when he said, “denyoyed” One does not enjoy something unless they are happy or in a cherry mindset.

This quote, describes the scenery as a place that they tumbleweeds. Steryotypically, tumbleweeds are found in dreary and lonely place. This lonely scenery takes it if full on the cyclist.

Because he was already running out of water it was making harder for him to have the will power and determination to go up and down these hills. His determination started to fade because he started to see wide open lands with nothing but “tumbleweeds and ridiculously large snakes.” He felt like he was going to dehydrate because the sun was beating down and had no water left.

This means the cyclist is going to put forth more energy to make it up these hills. Energy he barely has. This  will drain almost all the energy the cyclist has. Another example is, “At some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path”(Kurmaskie @NUM1). This means that the cyclist is in the middle of nowhere with barely any water and energy, causing even more problems. In conclusion, the setting in, “Do not exceed posted speed limit” by Joe Kurmaskie caused many problems for the cyclist.  "

Yet he continues on and then says “what I believed was my last burst of energy,” “I was going to die.” The cyclist dosent think he can continue but manages to keep going hoping that the next horizon to see a building or something.

Also, the essay describes a building with a poster of a small child drinking a refreshing glass of juice,this made the cyclist think more about water and  become very thirsty. Although thier was some possitive effects of the setting on the cyclist. The pebbles aloud him to keep his mouth moist and not think so much of his thirst.

The harsh setting in “DO Not Exceed Posted Speed limit “by Joe Kurmaskie made the @CAPS1 for the cyclist more difficult due to the hot weather and the inconsistancy of the pavement. The very hot June day was a cause of the cyclist slowing down. “wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt and the growing realization that I could drop from heat stroke on a gorgeous day in June.” This proves that the cyclist is very hot due to the summer heat. Another factor of the cyclist slowing down is the inconsistant of the pavement on the road “Flat road was replaced by short rolling hills.” The @CAPS2 proves that the road could be slowing the cyclist also. It seems the cyclist has a lot against him. But if he keeps his head up he can make it to “Yosemite.”"

If he had been traveling in the @DATE2, for example, he @MONTH1 have been more comfortable. Throughout his trip, the author does not after come desert civilization. He runs into a deserted factory and miles of land without people. The fact that he is traveling through desert terrain also helps us realize that water is scarce. He has trouble finding a place to get water. This made the trip extra hard and discouraging. “I was going to die” he says.

If the cyclist did not have the proper gean he could be hurt by all three of these factors. Secondly, “Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.” @CAPS2 his endurance is being tested because it is going for tolerance energy and will power to climb each individual hill. Most importantly, with his lack of water in his bottles, all of these characteristics were harmful. Within a desert, water is to be found nowhere. In hot weather, the water bottles will turn warm and in sunlight, water could even evaporate. To me, it seems like the setting and the weather were the perfect combination for doing much more harm than good."

He was “travelling through the high deserts of California in June.” This is a very hot time of year, and when a person get lost without conserving water, which he had not done, a person get extremely thirsty. Not to mention the “sandblasted picture of a young boy pourng a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth,” which would remind the body of its thirst.

Another feature of the setting that the author described was the cyclist’s location. He was traveling through the high deserts of California. This gives you a sense of how much hotter it is since he’s traveling through deserts during early summer while the sun is high. After the first couple town, he starts to ride on short, rolling hills.

This could impact someone greatly who has never biked on different levals before. Lastly, the feeling of hoped could have effected him the most.

I began breaking the ride clan into distances I could see on the horizon” The cyclist had to do this because they were having trouble riding since they were thirsty and the ride was very boring. This makes the ride seem larges so it also makes it harder to ride. Also in the essay it states, ""One ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps” This affeted the cyclist because after seeing this and later realizing he could’t drink the water, he was more thirsty since he was running out of water. When the cyclist notices the Welch‘s grape juice factory, he bacames determined to get there.

For example, in the short-story it says, “over one long crippling hill, a building came into view” This shows the conditions in which the cyclist had to deal with. In addition, the weather and amount os water can also decide the future. “The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips. Wide rings of sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke.” This shows us that if the cyclist gets dehydrated enough he could pass out and no one would find him in the desert. In addition, the heat isn’t helping him out any once he could die without anyone knowing. These reasons show us a cyclist needs to make sure they have enough water and the conditons and weather is right so they don’t make a life-threating choice."

The setting of the story in Yosemite provided many obstacles such as the vastness of the park, the summer heat, and the fact that many places had been abandoned. The summer heat was the biggest problem for the cyclist. He had to bike many miles, but he only had limited supply of water. Eventually, his water supply began to run low, which increased his determination to find the next town before he collapsed. It is this determination which moves him from ghost town to ghost town and keeps the story moving. Another big problem was the vastness of Yosemite National Park, which he was biking through. Any wrong turns (which he took, thanks to the direction he was given) could get him lost and thrown off track for a very long time. It was his confusion as to where the next time was that kept him biking, with difficulty and made for an interesting story. An example of the vastness of the park was when he quote, “About forty miles into the pedal, I arrived at the first ‘town.’ This place might have been a thriving spot at one time-say, before the last world war-but on that morning it fit the traditional definition of a ghost town.” This quote shows that even after many miles, he hadn’t seen a sign of anyone living, which would have increased his desperation to keep looking for civilization."

For example in the story it said, ”At same point, tumple weed crossed my path.” This is saying that he is in the desert or somewhere very hot because I know that you usually only see tumple weeds in very hot places. Thus, being in the desert affect the cyclist because he is already low on water then being  in a place as hot as the desert made him get even nor dehydrated. Another feature in the setting in this story that affected the cyclest is the hills he had to climb. This affected him because he was already  dehydrated and climbing hills made him have to work more which caused him to lose more sweat and become even more dehydrated. Those are two examples of how the features in the setting of this story affected the cyclest."

At first when the sun was beating down on him, he didn’t mind; the thoughts of Yosemite kept him determined. Later however, his determination was fading as he realized that his “short cut” was not so short after all. The “high deserts of California in June” and the terrain changed furthered his dehydration and need to find water. The emptiness of his surrounding with “no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind” made him focus on the horizon and tell himself that if he made it there, the he’d be alright. Finally, a building came into view. The hope he got from this gave him strength to move on. Ironically it was an abandoned building. The cyclist describes it as a “Welch’s Grape Juice factory and bottling plant.” @CAPS2 this he had lost hope and hung his head. Believing he was going to die, the cyclist got back on his bike. Driving away from the factory, he saw a sight of a fish camp and immediately regained hope. Going there, he regained his strength and learned his lesson, never take road advice from other people.  "

Also it says how he went to a couple towns that were deserted so there was no way to replenish his water. It says, “I pumped that handle for several minutes, but the water wouldn’t cool down. When I tried a drop or two, it had the flavor of battery acid.” @CAPS1 thing about his setting that changed was the hills.  But once he came to a bait shop, the old man asks  him if he  knows the best way to get to Yosemite, and he responds, “yes- sir: I own a very good map.” @CAPS2 by this he’s understood that the best way to travel anywhere is the path or road he knows because he’ll know what to expect. This is how the setting changed."

At first, he is lent courage by his surroundings. When he passes through the first town, abandoned and empty, he is still confidant he can go on sparred by the lush green trees and the cool rivers around him that belied the hot sun overhead. They are basically the reason he continued to go on. Later on during his trek through the desolated empty desert, his bleak surroundings make him feel hopelessness as well as despair.

Had he been driving through, say, a forest or perhaps rolling grasslands, he might not have been in such danger, and could have merely looked for a river or dreck for water if he was desperate. Another thing that might have affected the cyclist would have been the affect of the desert on his mind. When people think of deserts they often think of dry, barren wastelands, complete with buzzards and maybe a dead cowskull, as in movies. Deserts are in intimidiating, they have a bad reputation and so, as he was riding through and was low on water thought of death how he was, ""going to die and the birds would pick (him) clean"" running through his now-teriffied head. Had he been in a city or in rolling farmland he might not have been as terrified. There are people in those places, and places to be safe there, but, in his desert, he had neither, allowing him to give way to despair. Setting does a lot to influence stories, so it is important to keep that in mind when reading. "
