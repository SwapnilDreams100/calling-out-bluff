"In the short story “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” by Joe Kurmaskie. the setting greatly affects the cyclist and his mindset. When the scenery is pretty and cheery, he is happy as well. This is shown when the author writes, “denyoved the serenity of an early- summer- evening.” This quote describes the scenery as a serre or peaceful place. His happiness is found in the first part of the quote when he said, “denyoyed” One does not enjoy something unless they are happy or in a cherry mindset. Therefore, the peaceful scery affected the cyclist by making him happy. the same can be said for merry scenery too. This is found when the author says, “At some point, tumble weeds crossed my path and the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke”. This quote, describes the scenery as a place that they tumbleweeds. Steryotypically, tumbleweeds are found in dreary and lonely place. This lonely scenery takes it if full on the cyclist. He becomes pessimist and is making of all that could go wrong, not all that could get better.

The setting of the story in Yosemite provided many obstacles such as the vastness of the park, the summer heat, and the fact that many places had been abandoned. The summer heat was the biggest problem for the cyclist. He had to bike many miles, but he only had limited supply of water. Eventually, his water supply began to run low, which increased his determination to find the next town before he collapsed. It is this determination which moves him from ghost town to ghost town and keeps the story moving. Another big problem was the vastness of Yosemite National Park, which he was biking through. Any wrong turns (which he took, thanks to the direction he was given) could get him lost and thrown off track for a very long time.

"In the story ""Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Limit,"" the features of the setting greatly affected the cyclist. As he was riding, he was passing through desert during June, a very hot month.There is not much water present in a desert (that would be part of the definition of a desert) and so, particularly in the even-hotter-than-normal June sun, he was at risk of running out of water. Had he been driving through, say, a forest or perhaps rolling grasslands, he might not have been in such danger, and could have merely looked for a river or dreck for water if he was desperate. Another thing that might have affected the cyclist would have been the affect of the desert on his mind.
