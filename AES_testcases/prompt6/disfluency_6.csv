"erm huh The builders of the Empire State Building were challenged the obstacles of construction, safety, and nature that did not allow dirigibles to dock there.These dirigibles or blimps were large balloons that were capable of carrying passengers but needed a great landing area.In order for dirigibles to be used as transportation, architects needed to design a suitable mooring mast.However, the weight and pressure of a blimp on a mast would cause a large amount of stress to the building's frame.The builders of the Empire State building were faced with producing ""over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications"" to the building's framework.huh like so.. erm Not only was attempting blimps to dock there a lot of work and very costly, builders were challenge with safety issues.As experienced to the German blimp ""Hindenburg,"" dirigibles that use hydrogen are ""highly flammable.""huh uh.. If any incident occurred over the Empire State building in New York, involving a dirigible, it would affect the enormous population in the area by killing so many lives.Flying too low over the city was another challenge to safety that a law would make illegal and unsuccessful for blimps to be used.Lastly, nature was an obstacle the builders faced in docking dirigibles.At mast times, the ""forceful winds"" would cause the back of the ship swivel which could lead to it hitting the sharp spires and be punctured.Lead weights were also not safe when dangling over pedestrians.These obstacles made it difficult to create gear that would allow dirigibles to dock on the building.",4
"so.. I mean ... The idea of using a mooring mast in order to allow dirigibles to dock at the top of the Empire State Building was never a practical one.This is due to the many struggles that were faced when Al Smith's team was attempting to create a mooring mast that would serve the purpose of docking dirigibles.um huh such obstacles included; the pressure a docked dirigible would have on the building itself, the hazards of high winds causing the dirigible to be shaken violently, the chance of the dirigible catching on fire due to the flamibility of the hydrogen if in it, and the close proximity the dirigible would have to other buildings in the area The first problem faced during the development of the mooring mast was the stress of the heavyweight of the dirigible would put on the building.""The steel frame of the [building] would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate [the added pressure from the dirigible].""The dirigible's weight was not the only thing that put stress on the building, the wind pressure would also.The wind made it difficult for creating a mooring mast's structure because it would not only add pressure to the building because the dirrigible itself to not be able to stay in one place ""Even if the dirrigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast.""An accident that could occur would be a fire due to possible flamibility.uh.. hmm like uh.. And since the dirrigible is so close to people, such as tourist on the building's observation deck, the dirrigible catching on fire (if it's filled with hydrogen instead of helium) could be more disastrous than if it landed in an open field.Lastly,  the dirigibleis so close to urban areas that it is illegal for such airships to dock or even fly at such proximity.For example, when the Los Angeles tested  the docking process to the mooring mast of the Empire State Building it ""could not get close enough to tie up because of forceful winds.""All of these were major obstacles to the building process of the Empire State Building and it's mooring mast for docking dirigibles.These are also the reasons why the architects of the Empire State Building came to the conclusion that such a structure would not be practical to construct.",4
"hmm well.. Although there were great hopes for the attempt to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building, many obstacles were faced while trying to reach this dream.One obstacle noticed while designing the mast to dock on, was that the height and weight of a dirigible would greatly add stress to the building's frame.This would then be transmitted to the building's foundation as well.This clearly possessed a problem bigger than the Empire State Building could withstand.Ahhh Ahhh Another reason that builders faced an obstruction in the hopes of allowing dirigibles to dock was safety reasons.One of the most apparent problems, was that most dirigibles outside of the @LOCATION2 were fueled by hydrogen gas, opposed to helium gas.erm I mean ... This posed a threat, for hydrogen is highly flammable.Putting a densely populated area such as downtown New York at risk consequently came as an obstacle for builders.well.. well.. The nature itself came as one of the last problems for such a dream.Winds that were constantly shifting due to extreme air currents, at the top of the building could easily cause the back of the dirigible to spin around the mooring mast.Again putting thousands of people below the building, was neither practical nor safe.""As quoted by the passage, ""the mooring mast of the Empire State Building was never destined to fulfill its purpose..."", clearly posing many obstacles in allowing to dock dirigibles on such a building.",4
"like so.. In the process of building the dock for dirigibles, builders faced some obstacles.The first obstacle builders faced, was the lack of suitable landing area.If there wasn't area to land, there was no reason or way to build it.like huh like I mean ... I mean ... I mean ... Also, the builders would have to remodel the whole building.After the building was framed to the 85th floor, they couldn't build the mast until the roof was done, so it took even longer.The greatest obstacle the mast dealt with was nature itself, because the winds on the tops of the buildings were constantly shifting, so there was no way for a dirigible to land or stay in place without crashing.The final obstacle builders faced was a law against airships flying too low to the urban areas, which made it illegal for a ship to ever tie up or even approach the building.As you can see, there were many obstacles, and the mast wasn't useful.It was a great idea.But in my opinion it was a waste of time and money.",4
"In, The Mooring Mast, by @ORGANIZATION2, there were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there.One problem was that the architects could not drop the mooring mast on top of the Empire State building's flat roof.hmm huh A thousand-foot dirigible would add stress to the building's frame.huh huh This means the still frame would have to be modified and strengthened.Another setback was that most blimps from outside the United States used hydrogen and hydrogen is highly flammable.Nature itself was the greatest obstacle.Ahhh hmm The winds on top on the building were always shifting due to the violent air current.like hmm If the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around.Lead weights were an option, but using these, where they would be dangling above pedestrians on the street, was not safe.The other practical reason why blimps could not more at the Empire State building was a law against airships flying too low over urban areas.This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building.",4
"Ahhh uh.. Based on the excerpt, the builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there.One obstacle was lack of suitable landing area; ""so were as long as one thousand feet, the same length as four blocks in New York City.""Another obstacle was the wieght of a mooring mast.I mean ... um ""The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened,"" which means they would have to modify the whole frame to bare the weight of the mooring mast which would cost over sixty thousand dollars.Safety was also an issue.Most dirigibles outside the United States used hydrogen.Hydrogen is extremely flammable, so if it caught fire over a highly populated area such as downtown New York than the accident would be much worse.um well.. um hmm Another issue was the fact that ""the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents.""Because of the wind the dirigible would swivel around the mooring mast.",3
"The people who were attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State went through many obstacles.uh.. so.. They would first have to modify and strengthened the buildings frame to accommodate this new situation.The architects designed a shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel tower that would be illuminated from inside, with a stepped-back design that imitated the overall shape of the building itself.uh.. Ahhh After doing all of that work they then found out that the mast of the Empire State building would never work.The greatest reason was saftey.Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used Hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable.like well.. The biggest obstacle was nature itself.I mean ... erm The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents.The other practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the empire state building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas.The law made it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area.By the late 1930's the idea of using the mooring mast for dirigibles and their passengers had quietly disappeared.Dirigibles instead of becoming the transportation of the future, had given way to airplanes.",3
"uh.. I mean ... The builders of the Empire state building faced the problem of how to keep the back end of the blimp from swaying in the wind.They were unable to solve this problem, as we see in paragraph @NUM1 where it says: ""Even if the derigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast.""Another problem with docking blimps on the Empire State building was a law that stopped dirigibles from flying too low over populated areas.There is proof of this in paragraph @NUM2 where it says ""The other practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas.""like I mean ... One more problem with mooring dirigibles on the Empire State was that it was hard for pilots to dock their ships on the mooring.well.. hmm erm Ahhh An example of this is in paragraph @NUM2 where it says ""The U.S. Navy dirigible Los Angeles approached the mooring mast but could not get close enough to tie up because of forceful winds.""",3
"I mean ... well.. The architects of the mooring mast were blind to the amount of problems that could have arisen.like Ahhh Balloons are not very strong and if they didn't already know, it's windy on the top of the empire state building.Ahhh erm The wind Could drive the drigible right into its spikey doom.I mean ... erm They had no real way of keeping the drigible contained because usually lead blocks held it down.From 102 stories in the air, that wasn't the safest plan.Also, most non-@CAPS1 dirigibles used hydrogen instead of helium.In a crowded New York City, a fireball like that would be devastating due to hydrogen being highly flammable.The builders really should have planned this out better.",3
"The builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there.so.. hmm The main obstacle was that the builders couldn't @CAPS1 put the mooring mast on the Empire State Building, because it had a flat roof.The mooring mast would put pressure on the building's fram.To overcome this obstacle the architects had to modify and strengthen the frame.well.. hmm More than sixty thousand dollars' went into the modifications of the framework.uh.. I mean ... The greatest obstacle though was nature, and there was nothing the builders could do about that.The violent air currents caused winds on the top of the building to constantly shift.hmm like In open fields dirigibles could be weighted down in the back using led weights, but with pedestrians around it wouldn't be practical nor safe.Without being weighted down the dirigibles would swivel around.",3
"In constructing the Empire State Building, builders faced multiple obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock atop the @CAPS1.One obstacle that constructors faced was modifications, ""The stress of the dirigibles load and wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the foundation.""With this obstacale contractors would need to reinforce the @CAPS1 of the frame and the foundation.hmm um hmm um well.. I mean ... And the obstacle as stated from the excerpt is ""most dirigibles from outside the United States use hydrogen rather than helium, which is flammable.""@CAPS2 that hydrogen is flammable it would not be good if a dirigible exploded over the streets of New York.uh.. hmm Those are the obstacles contractors faced during the construction of the Empire State Building.",3
"The Empire State Building was in construction the building passed for many obstacles.I mean ... well.. hmm I mean ... First, because they wanted to do the biggest build in the world and they had to work hard.huh um um huh The State building was destined to never fulfill its purpose for reason that should have been apparent before it was ever constructed",0
"Building a big piece of work is not easy.You have to fix the negatives and do everything correctly.I mean ... huh You never know at times you have to tear things down for hard work to be completed right.uh.. erm When looking at you did right things to prevent bad things from occurring.You may face a whole bunch of things when building.I mean ... hmm The Empire faced attemps one allowed to dock when building the dirigibles to the dock was not performed or built right.Even though said, swinging to climb on as build pressure by.Although, Building things is hard.well.. well.. You get the beauty and hardship out of it.It helps you reminded of your wells done correctly.",0
so.. erm I mean ... huh like erm I mean ... uh..  The Empire State Building faced in attempting to build the highest Building in New york Because they wanted to be so big and they have been working on it for so menny years.,0
well.. uh..  The Empire State Building faced alot promblems before it came out as an @ORGANIZATION1.They scared that other people will destroy this Building.So the reduced the dirigibles to dock there.erm I mean ... They wanted their city to become a famous city and get more money.huh erm so.. hmm And other problem the some people didn't care and postpone to later.,0
 Based on the excerpt the obstacles that the builders faced.so.. hmm erm um hmm uh.. hmm hmm was that they had to go to the base of the building to make it taller.This is The obstacles that they faced.,0
