"There were many obstacles that the builders faced in attempting to have dirigibles dock at the Empire State Building. Safety was an issue with the dirigibles because of the highly flammable gas hydrogen. So, if the dirigibles explode over New York many people could be killed in the very populated. Another problem is keeping the derigible @CAPS1 so people can get off while the wind moves the back end of itself. The only way was to tie lead weights down in the back of the dirigible, but it would be dangerous over people down below. So, these obstacles workers faced, never got past them and so they made the world's highest soda fountain and tea garden for tourists in the observation area..So you love the way he holds you in the night   And you believe him when he tells you   Everything's alright   But I wonder if you know   The nature of his game   And all the others he's been lovin' just the same   Yeah      CHORUS   Sooner or later, somebody's gotta let you know   Sooner or later, somebody's gotta let you know   It might as well be me   It might as well be me   Yeah         Promises and plans inside your head   As you sit alone and think of things he said   But of all the love you tell me   You know you've been tastin'   It's much more than all your time   I know you've been wastin' babe, yeah         CHORUS         I hate to be the one to bring you down   But everybody's talking, it's all over town   The same old story   They tell me that's the way it goes   I'm the first to tell you, now   And, baby you're the last to know, yeah         CHORUS   Sooner or later, somebody's gotta let you know   Sooner or later, somebody's gotta let you know.But late one day, them horses run away..I'd tell you I miss you but I don't know how   I've never heard silence quite this loud      Now I'm standing alone   In a crowded room   And we're not speaking   And I'm dying to know   Is it killing you   Like it's killing me yeah   I don't know what to say   Since the twist of fate   When it all broke down   And the story of us   Looks a lot like a tragedy now      This is looking like a contest   Of who can act like they care less   But I liked it better when you were on my side   The battle's in your hands now   But I would lay my armor down   If you'd say you'd rather love than fight   So many things that you wish I knew   But the story of us might be ending soon      Now I'm standing alone   In a crowded room   And we're not speaking   And I'm dying to know   Is it killing you   Like it's killing me yeah   I don't know what to say   Since the twist of fate   When it all broke down   And the story of us   Looks a lot like a tragedy now, now, now      And we're not speaking   And I'm dying to know   Is it killing you   Like it's killing me yeah   I don't know what to say   Since the twist of fate   'Cause we're going down   And the story of us   Looks a lot like a tragedy now.Downtown Jimmy, say you're feeling kinda blue   It's no problem, this is what you gotta do   Telephone your baby, tell her that you're working late   Come and pay a visit, please don't hesitate      Come join the party, come along and be our guest   Sit back and let us do the rest, we're the best, yeah      Come on an' meet me at the station, don't pack your bags, just fix your hair   Gotta get up, gotta get in, gotta get out, just look for me, I'm always there      [Chorus:]      Come on let's ride, ride that gypsy train   All aboard, now don't you be afraid   Come on let's ride, ride that gypsy train   Feed the fire, let's go one mo' time again      Medication, little love and sympathy, cool libation, it's complimentary   Play a little poker, love when the stakes are high   Lotta nasty women, giving everyone the eye      Say downtown Jimmy, tell me what you need, satisfaction guaranteed   Guaranteed, yeah      It's a perfect situation, it's so nice to have you here   Gotta get up, gotta get in, gotta pull out, happy shiny people everywhere      It's a perfect situation, it's so nice to have you here   Gotta get up, gotta get in, gotta put out, happy shiny people everywhere.M-hm, M-hm,   He said, ""Miss Mouse, are you within?"".Who would've thought of it   That I might feel like this   Some kind of wonderful   There's nothing quite comparable      The thing about it is   It's oh so innocent   I wasn't looking for   It came knockin' at my door      I'm trying to do things right   But I'm about to lose this fight   'Cause spending time with you   Well, it feels so good and that's the truth      And every day with you   I swear it brings me closer   To my only reservation is you   My sweet temptation, baby..I am aghast!.You can still barrel house, baby, on the riverside..Mr. Sandman showing his beam   When he walks into the room   The walls lean in to listen   Surf out brain waves   Click back and forth like old headlights   Sniffing model glue again      Head like a steel trap   Wish I didn't, I didn't, I didn't, I didn't,   I didn't, I didn't, I didn't, I don't   Just want to be a footnote in someone else's happiness."
"In the passage The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon @CAPS1. The builders of the Empire State Building faced opstacles in the building of the Empire State Building, in allowing dirigibles to dock there.One reason is that Al Smith (four-term governor of New York who headed efforts to construct the Empire State Building after his years in office) had made the tower tall... The hight of the building was 1,250 ft. But after almost losing the title of worlds tallest tower he announced that there would be a top or hat put on the tower.Another reason is the tower was made for Dirigibles (blimps) That Could @CAPS2 people from New York to New Jersey. Smith wanted a place where dirigibles could dock off. But it never happened because the German dirigible ""Hindenburg"" was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, and on May 6, 1937 the owners of the State building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it was over New York.In the 1930's the idea was dropped after another dirigible was trying to proform a stunt. The Empire State Building never got to fofil what it was made for..I believe in You,   The joy of my salvation   I believe in You,   Saviour of my life      For without You I can do nothing   But with You I am strong   To follow with Your truth   Jesus, I believe in You      I believe in You   A fire burns within me   I believe in You   My life will bring You praise      For without You I can do nothing   But with You I am strong   To follow with Your truth   Jesus, I believe in You      I owe You my life   I will worship You forever   I owe You my life   I will live to bring You praise (2x)      I believe in You   Your grace has overwhelmed me   I believe in You   The lover of my soul      For without You I can do nothing   But with You I am strong   To follow in Your truth   Jesus, I believe in You      I owe You my life   I will worship You forever   I owe You my life   I will live to bring You praise (2x).I heard about this story in the news today   About a man who lost his senses, lost his way   About a man who had his world taken away   He took his life but not before he made them pay   So go on ask yourself the question   Are you convinced that you're OK?.Once I made a promise that I'd never lead you on   But I feel the yearn to love you even though I know it's wrong   You'll have to take my hand and lead me slowly through the door   I'll be wrong in what I'm doin' I can't refuse you anymore   Lead me on and take control of how I feel   I can't do this on my own cause it's against my will   I need love warm and tender in a way I've never known   If you want me I'll go with you but you'll have to lead me on   [ steel ]   Lead me on and take control....You're not to blame..I can, in every way   Distinct the pain I feel inside   It comes to me   Evil thoughts is creeping through my mind   Who are you to say that I can't speak what's on my mind?.Death row come to show you all the game at,   And show you how my label got the name that   So many wanna see me, and time is money,   But never in the p-e-n, yo..And then, when the empress run aground,   And my eyes turned blue and green,   I heard a gorgeous sound,   And that's when it became a dream,   When the sky fell in,   When the hurricanes came for me,   I could finally crash again,   And that's how I became the sea..Up and down the stairs   In and out the door   Walked every inch of the floor   You think you know a place   But there locked in an empty room   Out of the dark comes you   I feel, I feel, I feel   A flood of light fall on my face   I see, I see, I see   For the first time   I hurt, I hurt, I hurt   So good inside I swear I could die   I love, I love, I love   For the first time   What is this fallin'   No dancin' down my cheek   Why's it hard for me to speak?.Don't you worry - He can hold you now."
" The obstacles the builders face were great. They explained how most dirigibles from outside the @LOCATION1 use a different gas called hydrogen which is highly flammable. Following that they told @LOCATION1 how Hindenburg by fire in 1937 which used hydrogen. They realized if this had happen in a urban area it could have been worse. Anthore obstacle they faced was the wind. If the dirigible was parked at mooring mast the violent wind speeds would make the Blimp shift and cause strees on the building steel frame. The greatest obstacle was the law passed. The law stated that no airships could fly to low in urban areas. This would keep blimps from landing there..And life is very difficult, when you're in the crowd   When you're in the crowd, you see things as they really are   You can smell the fear and hate, generated by all around -   I want to breakaway, but the ties are too strong   want to go on holiday, but the crowd says I can't   See life is very different, when you're in the crowd   Oh, sometimes in the night, I wish I was faraway   But then I realize, even escape will be in vain   I want to close my eyes and be like the rest   I mean, nobody wants to die, although the crowd say they do   Look, life is very intricate, when you're in the crowd   Life becomes the movies   And everyone has a role   It's easy being the actor   When the combine's the only star -   Sunday papers   And the dailies   Ena Sharples   Page 3 girls   News at ten   War in Rhodesia   Far away   In a distant land   But we're alright   We're nice and warm here   No one to hurt us   Except ourselves.Didn't I, didn't I try to love you?.'Cause he wants to hear from you   Have you talked to the man upstairs?.Alone at last in a hideaway far away   From all the worries in the world..Too late to call for the priest   He is not here anymore   We look at the age of the beast   And we've seen its vast armies form   Hear our call      [Chorus]   Please, save us   Please, save us      In permanent madness we live   No time for life and for love   To take is the rule, not to give   Insanity comes from below   To take us all      [Chorus]      We believe that the phenomena of nature   Are the expression of infinitive intelligence   We express our belief that all forms of life   Are manifestations of spirit   And thus, all men are children of God      Far from down below one comes prepared to take us all   Waiting for his future and the final call      We stand on the edge of the world   Just one step more and we fall   Guide us and please take our hands   Without you we're weak and alone   Hear our call      [Chorus]      Now!.Breathe, breathe in the air..And the souls that had put off salvation,   Not tonight I'll get saved by and by,   No time now to think of salvation,   At last they had found time to die..But....Such a feeling is coming over me   There is wonder in 'most everything I see   Not a cloud in the sky, got the sun in my eyes   And I won't be surprised if it's a dream      Everything I want the world to be   Is now coming true especially for me   And the reason is clear, it's because you are here   You're the nearest thing to heaven that I've seen      I'm on the top of the world looking down on creation   And the only explanation I can find   Is the love that I've found ever since you've been around   Your love's put me at the top of the world      Something in the wind has learned my name   And it's telling me that things are not the same   In the leaves on the trees and the touch of the breeze   There's a pleasing sense of happiness for me      There is only one wish on my mind   When this day is through I hope that I will find   That tomorrow will be just the same for you and me   All I need will be mine if you are here      I'm on the top of the world looking down on creation   And the only explanation I can find   Is the love that I've found ever since you've been around   Your love's put me at the top of the world      I'm on the top of the world looking down on creation   And the only explanation I can find   Is the love that I've found ever since you've been around   Your love's put me at the top of the world"
"While building the Empire State Building, workers faced many obstactles while attempting for dirigibles to dock there. A dirigible attached to the mast and building would add extra stress, so builders instead had to over sixty thousand dollars worth of reconstructions to fix the buldings framework. Dirigibles also dock with a line running from the front of the ship to the mast, and while they planned for the blimp to be able to sway in the wind, it was unrealistic that any ship could attach to the building at the high winds.Other obstacles they faced in letting dirigibles dock the building, was because of the safety hazards, the hydrogen used in most dirigibles from outside of the U.S. is highly flammable. Builders also did not take into consideration the pre-existing law against airships flying too low over urbanized areas, so it was illegal for a dirigible to tie to the building. The task of having dirigibles attach to the Empire State building was an impossible task to begin with. .It's tough but we're gonna get by..In between your folks and a birthday toast   It was black from your fringe to your shoes   I'm picking apples out of paintings   And making record covers in the sky   I missed my boat sitting here imagining   Your face when you cry      Don't be cruel, come on be sugar in my tooth   I think I like what I don't know about you      This whole day threw up some tickets   None I'd ever choose   The sky's so heavy it hangs like a beer gut   Spilling stuff on my shoes   Don't get me wrong, I ain't complaining   I still got my legs like an old Christmas tree   But if I got faith why am I so scared   Everybody's dying on me      Don't be cruel, come on be sugar in my tooth   I think I like what I don't know about you   Don't be cruel, come on be champagne in my shoe   I think I like what I don't know about you      Fish and chips stall down the south coast ready   I can show you what I'm worth   So set me up a bottle and salt and vinegar   If you get there first   I said if you get there first      Don't be cruel, come on be sugar in my tooth   I think I like what I don't know about you   Don't be cruel, come on be champagne in my shoe   I think I like what I don't know about you.And all of that good energy is coming right up here on the stage..Sons and Daughters, Daughters and Sons   When a marriage goes down they're the loneliest ones   Sons and Daughters, Daughters and Sons   How I hope they can cope with the damage I've done   I got a new contract, I got a new life   No more capstans for me and I've got a new wife   Sometimes she gets angry, says she wants a family   Then that nightmare returns like a ghost haunting me   Sons and Daughters, Daughters and Sons   When a marriage breaks up you're the loneliest ones   Sons and Daughters, Daughters and Sons   How I hope you all cope with the damage we done.I'm hungry   I'm hungry   Yeah, I'm hungry   Oh, I'm hungry.Can't you feel it rising?.It doesn't matter what car you drive, she'll wreck it   It doesn't matter where you sleep at night, she'll wreck it   It doesn't matter where you go to work   Doesn't matter where you go to church   Doesn't matter just how bad it hurts, she'll wreck it      My bleached bones in the desert, it's all she's left of me      Poison ivy in your touch, being with you destroyed so much   Home wrecker   Deadly venom in your kiss, hell can't be worse than this   Home wrecker      It doesn't matter what you pretend, she'll wreck it   It doesn't matter what you defend, she'll wreck it   It doesn't matter how you live your life   Doesn't matter anymore to your wife   Doesn't matter even how you die, she'll wreck that too      Like a vulture picking my bones clean, it's all that's left of me      Poison ivy in your touch, being with you destroyed so much   Home wrecker   Deadly venom in your kiss, hell can't be worse than this   Home wrecker      Doesn't matter where you live   Doesn't matter what you drive   Home wrecker      Poison ivy in your touch, being with you destroyed so much   Home wrecker   Deadly venom in your kiss, hell can't be worse than this   Home wrecker.Say Bye bye, baby   And then you say Bye bye, girl   And then you say Get the suitcases, honey   I don't want to see you, hear the words..I sent a message to another time,   But as the days unwind, this I just can't believe,   I send a note across another plane,   Maybe it's all a game, but this I just can't conceive      I drive the very latest Hover car,   I don't know where you are   But I miss you so much till then,   I met someone who looks a lot like you,   She does the things you do, but she is an IBM      She's only programmed to be very nice,   But she's as cold as ice, whenever I get too near,   She tells me that she likes me very much,   But when I try to touch, she makes it all too clear."
"Builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. A one thousand-foot dirigible, attached to a single cable tether, would add stress to the buildings framed if the dirigible was placed at the top of the building. The buildings frame would have to be strengthened and modified to accommodate the situation. Over @MONEY1 worth of modifications would have to be installed into the framework. some other obstacles builders faced was the safety. The dirigibles ran on hydrogen which is flammable. Another obstacle was the weather. The winds shifted at the top of the Empire State building were shifting due to violent air currents. One last obstacle was an existing law that airships could not fly too low over urban areas. The idea of a dirigible quietly disappeared..Hurry now, we must protect ourselves and find some shelter   Strike by night!.Always love you tender but you only like it rough..And I was just thirteen   When I had to leave home..Never walk away..Feel like a whore..No cabs   To be had out there   I wish I knew how   Your eyes   Are like starlight now   To break the spell   I'll take your hat   Your hair looks swell      I ought to say   No, no, no sir   Mind if I   Mmove in closer?.They are dying on the dance floor   They are lying in debris   They are fading with exhaustion   From the mortal injuries      They are hungry and need feeding   They've resigned themselves to fate   They are desperate men   Death's written on their face      When your will to live   Is all but gone   And you're left alone   But you need someone - feed on me   Feed on me      They're outgunned and they're outnumbered   But they'll never turn to run   And the ""In the name of freedom's""   Written with their blood      Some would call them mercenary   But they always knew the pain   Inevitably far outweighs the gain      Feed on me   Feed on me if you need to breathe   Feed on me   When your hunger strikes you down again   And you feel your inner strength has drained feed on me   Feed on me      Feed on me I got what you need   Feed on me   Feed on me don't accept defeat      They are dying on the dance floor   They are lying in debris   They are fading with exhaustion   From the mortal injuries      Some would call them mercenary   But they always knew the pain   Inevitably far outweighs the gain      When your will to live has almost gone   And you're left alone and you need someone   Feed on me   Feed on me      Feed on me   Feed on me I got what you need   Feed on me   Feed on me don't accept defeat.And though it seems a pity, it   Was so..We could do some nice things like that."
" The builder's of the Empire State Building faced many difficult obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock. The greatest obstacle of the use of a mooring mast was the wind. At the top of the Empire State Building the winds were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. The winds would cause the back of the dirigible to swivel around the mooring mast. Another reason the dirigibles would not be able to more at the Empire State Building is because there is a law that says airships cannot fly low in urban areas. This would make it illegal for the dirigible to approach or dock at the Empire State Building..Ain't no sunshine when she's gone   It's not warm when she's away   Ain't no sunshine when she's gone   She's gone much too long   Any time she goes away      Ain't no sunshine when she's gone   Wonder if she's gone to stay   Ain't no sunshine when she's gone   And this house just ain't no home   Anytime she goes away      I know   She's gone to stay   It's breakin' me up   Anytime she goes away   Gotta leave the young thing alone   There ain't no sunshine when she's gone      Ain't no sunshine when she's gone   It's not warm when she's away   Ain't no sunshine when she's gone   And she's gone much too long   Any time she goes away      Ain't no sunshine when she's gone   I wonder if she's gone to stay   There ain't no sunshine when she's gone   And this house just ain't a home   Any time she goes away      I know   She's gone to stay   It's breaking me up   Any time she goes away   Gotta leave the young thing alone   There ain't no sunshine when she's gone      Ain't no sunshine when she's gone   I wonder if she's gone to stay   Ain't no sunshine when she's gone   And this house just ain't no home   Any time she goes away   Any time she goes away.May this day show me an ocean,   I ought to be on my way..I stepped on a flower, foot on the petal   Good wasn't home, so I settled for better   I'm on my way to get it, but get it got shot   So I guess I gotta work with the little bit I got   Now I'm like ""Hey, I like the view from here!"".Looking from a window above   It's like a story of love   Can you hear me..The end!!!!.it's too late!.Mr. Popeil!.Yeah, I'm going back to that shack way across that railroad track,   Uh huh, that's where I think I belong..We ran out of luck seems like lightning struck."
"Based on the story it all started when they had build the empire state building and the workers should have knowned that the building was too big for the wind climate, up in the sky and plus when you make a building like that you have to make sure it's strong enough to keep balance.                         They faced problem's like when the U.S. tried to make a deal with them if they would let them use the top of the building for a dock to let civilians on the deck, and after they made a law that no more blimps can land on the dock a blimp attempted to land on the dock..The mysteries met,   The sky looks threatened   Heading home in the dust,   Singing ""Life is Forgetting"",   Good enough for the frivolous      There's one thing I remember is   This tear on your bare shoulder,   This little silver boulder,   This slowly falling star..

"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle was modifying and strengthening the frame of the building. It says that ""over @NUM1 thousand dollar's worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework"" in order to accommodate dirigibles. However, after the modifications were made, the builders had to face another set of obstacles, more serious than before. the first one was ""safety"": the destruction of the Hindenburg in @LOCATION3 raised fear for a densely populated area such as New York. Another obstacle was ""nature""; the strong winds and violent air currents on the top of the Empire State Building made dirigibles ""neither practical nor safe"". the third obstacle was ""an existing law against airships flying to low over urban areas"". this law made it ""illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area."" the Los Angeles and Columbia dirigibles attempted a few things, but unsuccessfully, and the idea of dirigibles disappeared by the late 1930's. these are the obstacles that the builders faced in attempting dirigibles to dock on the Empire state building..Six o'clock, eight o'clock, nine o'clock, ten,   The neighbors all know that you're at it again..How deep is the red our redeemer bled?.Nothin'   (Whoa)..Uh, they call me G H E T T O, nigga   Uh, uh, I'm back on that bullshit   Ha, ha, who could fuck around?.I'm gonna run to you   I'm gonna come to you   Baby, what else can I do?.It's precious beauty lies just beyond the eye..My face like a mannequin..Some say that hell is heaven..I recall, he started small   He had to pick-a-pocket or two."
"Based on the excerpt, The Mooring Mast by @PERSON1, the builders of the Empire State Building were faced with a number of obstacles while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the top. The greatest obstacle the builders faced was nature itself. @PERSON1 stated, ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents,"" therefore it wasn't safe for dirigibles to be docked there. The wind would cause them to swivel around the mast, and it would be unsafe for the builders to hang lead weights on the dirigibles because they would be dangling above the pedestrians on the street. The other obstacle which prevented dirigibles from mooring at the Empire State Building was due to the law against airships flying too low over urban areas or cities. This existing law made it illegal for dirigibles to ever tie up to the building or just approach it because the area was too low over the city. @PERSON1 said, ""although two dirigibles did attempt to reach the building before the entire idea was dropped."" @CAPS1 two dirigibles failed at getting close enough to tie up or to deliver there cargo safetly, because of the forceful winds and the non-existence of certain mooring equipment, which should've been installed. Due to the obstacles, dirigibles were never able to moor at the building..What a joy I feel to think about forever   I'm a child of God   with blessings from Heaven   By your side, days always brighter   The Holy one   My Master   My Father      I will dwell in your courts   I will sing for you   you're my deepest love   Jesus   I love you      It's a love song I sing   It's an anthem from my heart   All praises to the King      I am not alone   Jesus   You're near me   Washed me clean with hands full of mercy   You're a resting place for all who are weary   A perfect place   and a new beginning.There's a place out on the edge of town, sir,   Risin' above the factories and the fields   Now, ever since I was a child, I can remember   That mansion on the hill      In the day you can see the children playing   On the road that leads to those gates of hardened steel   Steel gates that completely surround, sir,   The mansion on the hill      At night my daddy'd take me and we'd ride   Through the streets of a town so silent and still   Park on a back road along the highway side   Look up at that mansion on the hill      In the summer all the lights would shine   There'd be music playin', people laughin' all the time   Me and my sister, we'd hide out in the tall cornfields   Sit and listen to the mansion on the hill      Tonight down here in Linden Town   I watch the cars rushin' by, home from the mill   There's a beautiful full moon rising   Above the mansion on the hill.How does it feel to be loved?.Done too soon..If you don't stop lying' on the floor..Stop haunting me now   Can't shake you, no how   Just leave me alone   I've got those Monday blues   Straight through Sunday blues      Good morning, heartache, here we go again   Good morning, hearache, you're the one who knew me when   Might as well get used to you hangin around   Good morning, heartache, sit down      Stop haunting me now   Can't shake you, no how   Just leave me alone   I've got those Monday blues   Straight through Sunday blues      Good morning, heartache, here we go again   Good morning, hearache, you're the one who knew me when   Might as well get used to you hangin around   Good morning, heartache, sit down.Bad boys watcha gon, watcha gon, watcha gonna do?.They say that heaven is ten zillion light years away   And just the pure at heart will walk her righteous streets someday   They say that heaven is ten zillion light years away   But if there is a God, we need Him now   ""Where is your God""   That's what my friends ask me   And I say it's taken Him so long   Cause we've got so far to come...

"Thraghat The process of attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire state building the builders faced many obstacles. The first obstacle that the bilders faced when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there occurred in the actual ""building"" process. Because the mast wald add to much stress to the frame of the building if simply attached to its flat roof, the buldas had to reconstruct the steel frame of the building in order to safely place the mast on top, a very expensive and time consuming project. Another obstacle that the builders faced when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire state building had to to with nature itself. Because the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting the back of the ship wald swivel around the mooring mast which was very unsafe. The laws against airships flying too low over urban areas also proved to be an obstacle because the Ships would never be able to actually approach the area. In conclusion, the builders faced many obstacles during construction for the dirigibles..I come one man, I come one man, I come one man   I come one man, I come one man, I come one man      Bunny girl, happy shopper..Tokyo girl, Tokyo girl   You've got the moves to rule the world   That cute inscru-tability   Tokyo girl, you're a mystery      Tokyo girl, Tokyo girl   Shaking up hearts around the world   You can't forget that stunning face   Smiling at you it's your destiny      She's got the face sweet as a baby   Elegant taste and money to burn   Her ""yes"" is ""no"", ""no"" is a ""maybe""   Her language is so hard to learn      Tokyo girl, Tokyo girl   You've got the moves to rule the world   That cute inscru-tability   Tokyo girl, you're a mystery      In Tokyo      Though there's a fire burns inside here   Outside is ivory, silk and ice   Nothing she wants is denied her   You'd better take my advice      Many has tried to get near her   Deep in the heart of Tokyo   Found nothing there but a mirror   She's no one you'll ever know      Tokyo girl, Tokyo girl   You've got the moves to rule the world   That cute inscru-tability   Tokyo girl, you're a mystery      In Tokyo      She's got the face sweet as a baby   Elegant taste and money to burn   Her ""yes"" is ""no"", ""no"" is a ""maybe""   Her language is so hard to learn      Tokyo girl, Tokyo girl   You've got the moves to rule the world   That cute inscru-tability   Tokyo girl, you're a mystery      Tokyo girl, Tokyo girl   Shaking up hearts around the world   You can't forget that stunning face   Smiling at you it's your destiny      In Tokyo, sweet as a baby   In Tokyo, sweet as a baby   In Tokyo, sweet as a baby   Sweet as a baby   Sweet as a baby   Sweet as a baby.When I'm watching my tv and that man comes on to tell me how white my shirts [?].The children are so very lucky,   But man's invention is gonna' be the prevention of their life..She looks down at me...

"The builders of the Empire State Building faced some obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles dock there. Some of these obstacles had easy solutions, but some of them were really hard to solve.One obstacle they had was the dirigible on top of the building being hold by a cable tether only would cause stress to the building's frame. In order to solve this problem they needed to make modifications that would cost around six thousand dollars. This wasn't the only problem, there was a law that prohibited airships flying too low over urban areas. This law made it illegal to get close to this area or even try to get tie up to the building. Adding to this, the most difficult obstacle the architects faced was nature, and this problem was hard to solve and also hard to control.All this obstacles they faced lead them to give up for now & wait to see if later with more technology the could finally make this dream come true..She is the day through which I walk toward the bridge where she stands..And you like the rock 'n' roller   A different life and whiskey Cola   But don't be low keep your own style   And catch your train!.Won't you ride me high   Tomorrow's the day   My bride's gonna come   I said oh no, are we gonna fly   Down into the easy chair!.I've been thinkin' 'bout the first time I looked at you   I got the feelin' that I found someone I've always known   And ever since that day, we laughed and we cried   We learned along the way that love takes a lifetime   Can't believe I've found somebody like you      You're still the reason why the sky will never fall   This love will never die forever we can have it all   And when I need to believe, I just look in your eyes   You're still the one, you're still the love of my life   Of my life, my life      We've had our ups and downs, we run against the wind   I built some mighty walls and watched your heart just climb right in   Some people thought we'd crumble but they were wrong, we survived   And makin' love to you still feels like the first time   Here with me, there ain't nobody but you      You're still the reason why the sky will never fall   This love will never die forever we can have it all   And when I need to believe, I just look in your eyes   You're still the one, you're still the love of my life      Had a taste of the cold hard rain   Walk through the winds of change   But they just made us that much stronger   Even now when I watch you sleep   Can't believe you're here with me   You are the answer, the answer to the rest of my life   You're still the reason why      You're still the reason why the sky will never fall   This love will never die forever we can have it all   And when I need to believe, I just look in your eyes   You're still the one, you're still the love of my life      You're still the reason why the sky will never fall   This love will never die forever we can have it all   And when I need to believe, I just look in your eyes   You're still the one, you're still the love of my life      You're still the reason why the sky will never fall   This love will never die forever we can have it all   And when I need to believe, I just look in your eyes   You're still the one, you're still the love of my life.The other side   The other side of me      Inside, I try   To make the pieces fit right   A jigsaw puzzle everywhere      'Cause I flip the script   So many times I forget   Who's on stage, who's in the mirror      Back in the spotlight   The crowd is calling   The paparazzi and the fame   (It can drive a girl insane)      Chorus      2nd Chorus      Down inside I'm not that different   Like everyone, I have a dream   Don't want to hide, just want to fit in   Sometimes it's harder than it seems      Chorus      2nd Chorus.Oh oh oh   Oh oh oh   Oh oh oh   Oh oh oh      If my heart is outta place move over,   I coulda told you how it hurts, coulda told ya..Somebody got to love me..Keep them other girls at bay,   Oh, I would blow them all away..Every picture tells a story don't it?"
"There were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. For one thing, the builders couldn't simply place a mast on top of the empire state building, because the building would surely collapse. ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the empire state building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame"". To change and fix this problem, over sixty thousand dollars would be needed for the modifications. Another obstacle the builder's failed to see was the actual construction of a modern-day dirigible. The dirigibles, ""used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly Flammable"". If the dirigibles were to ever explode while docking, the situation would have been horrible over a densely populated area of New York. Lastly, the greatest obstacle of the building was nature itself. ""Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around"". this would be very dangerous. The dirigible could @CAPS1 over pedestrians the streets meaning it was not safe at all. There are three obstacles that prevented the empire state building from allowing dirigibles to dock there..This is New York, yo   (It's getting dark)      Night falls on the city   Finds me all alone   Makes me wonder   Should I just go on home      And I walk up the stairs   To see if you're sill there   Would you mind if   I found you alone      Then a cold wind came callin'   Strange how it knew it'd bother me   See the night would fade   But the pain's gonna stay   Makes me wonder   Have you ever made love to me      I can't stop the rain, here it comes again   Lightnin' strikes across the sky   Oh, I can't stop the rain, here it comes again   Lightnin' only blinds my eyes      Ain't it sad   When the only love I ever had   Just slips away   Right through my fingers      Ain't it a shame when I think of your name   The only memory I have is it      I can't stop the rain, here it comes again   Lightnin' strikes across the sky   Oh, I can't stop the rain, here it comes again   It takes a witch to curse that goddamn sky      I can't stop the rain, here it comes again   Lightnin' strikes across the sky   Oh, I can't stop the rain, here it comes again   'Cause lightnin' only blinds my eyes      Oh, I can't stop the rain, here it comes again   'Cause lightnin' only blinds my eyes      Can't stop it, blinds my eyes.First there was nothing   Till I created the word   First there was nothing   And nothing was good   Nothing is moving   Nothing is moving   Nothing was heard      And who am I anyway   If I don' t have a name   If moving is nothing   And nothing is shame   Nothing is moving   Nothing is moving   Nothing' s the same      And the word is me   And I am the word   My mind is free   Like a beautiful bird   And the terms of love   And the germs of hate   Nothing is waiting   Nothing is waiting      First there was darkness   Till I created the night   First there was darkness   And darkness was right   Darkness is moving   Darkness is moving   Into light      And the word is me   And I am the word   My mind is free   Like a beautiful bird   And the terms of love   And the germs of hate   Nothing is waiting      First there was darkness   Till I created the night   First there was darkness   And darkness was right   Darkness is moving   Into light....It's the end, the end of the seventies   It's the end, the end of the century      Do you remember lying in bed   With the covers pulled up over your head   Radio playin' so no one can see?.They say so and so was dating   Love you or they're hatin'   When it doesn't matter anyway   'Cause we're here tonight      If you smiling, that should set the tone   Just be limber baby   If you let go, the music should groove your bones   Baby just remember   Sing this song with me      Ain't nobody love you like I love you   You're a good girl and that's what makes me trust ya   Late at night, I talk to you   You will know the difference when I touch you      Yeah, you know I can make ya happy   I could change your life   If you give me that chance   To be your man   I won't let you down baby   If you give me that chance   To be your man   Here baby, put on my jacket   And then      Maybe we'll fly tonight (I just wanna love you baby)   Yeah, yeah, yeah   Maybe we'll fly tonight (I just wanna love you baby)   Girl      Ma, what you wanna do?.Have you ever hated yourself for staring at the phone?.Luanne, luanne   Don't keep your love inside   I write letters that I never send   I keep the words to whisper to you someday   I don't know where and I don't know when   Luanne I'm gonna get to you someway   I want to feel your love so close to me   Give me just half a chance   To prove myself, I need to   Luanne, luanne   Why do you run and hide?.Now, all the mistakes and secrets   Cannot be erased      Viewing the blind complexity   By which laws were justified   To erase simplicity      To the left and to the right   From behind - they're out of sight   Plunging into a new found   Age of advanced observeillance   A worldwide, foolproof cage      Privacy and intimacy as we know it   Will be a memory   Among many to be passed down   To those who never knew      Living in the pupil of 1,000 eyes      We are enslaved now....So, it's easy to see,   Just how good You been to me..Friends and lovers, give a call, take a chance on a voice if you can."
"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many problems that ""Should have been apparent before it was ever constructed. One of the problems that they faced was that many dirigibles ""used hydrogen rather than, helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" This factor caused that the owners of the Building to worry about the safety of the many civilians that lived in downtown New York. Another factor that the builders face was that the winds ""were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" This caused problems because in landing fields the blimps could be weighted down with lead weights but that could not be done at the Empire State Building; many dirigibles would not be able to reach the Building either due to the winds. One last factor that was faced is that it is against the law to have airships fly to low over the urban areas. This ""law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area."" All these factors caused ""the idea of using the mooring mast for drigibles and passengers"" to disappear..Brought to this world to wither again   Naive about the ways of life is what they say   Millions live millions die, more are yet to come   Living skeletons   Where they come from      Born dead into this world   To starve and rot in agony   Born dead into this world   It's their choice, why can't you see      Life of misery, soon a corpse you be   As bones show through, nothing you can do      Relief does not exist   When you are born to die      Disease spreads fast across their dying world   Many cemeteries they will have to build   As process goes on for many years to come   A human waste land created when they are done      Born dead into this world   To starve and rot in agony   Born dead into this world   It's their choice, why can't you see.I go where I go and I get there fast   Don't stop me   I know that it's not gonna last   Forever, forever   (Saturday night, Saturday night)   Forever, forever   (Saturday night, Saturday night)   If you see someone gorgeous   Then you think am I in with a chance?.Go, go Johnny!.A while ago somewhere I don't know when   I was watching a movie with a friend..What is this that stands before me   Figure in black which points at me   Turn 'round quick and start to run   Find out I'm the chosen one      Oh, no      Big black shape with eyes of fire   Telling people their desire   Satan sitting there, he's smiling   Watches those flame get higher and higher      Oh, god, lease help me   Oh, no, no      Child cries out for its mother   Mother screaming in the fire   Satan points at me again   Opens the door to push me in      Oh, no   Oh, god      Is it the end my friend   Satan's coming 'round the bend   People running 'cause they're scared   You people better go and beware      No, no   Please, god, no.Who is there on the line?"".Well, who's that a-walkin' down the street   Pickin' up those dainty little feet   Who's the one that catches my eye   Everytime she passes by - gee whizz it's you      Ever since we said goodbye, all because of a little white lie,   Let me tell you why we parted, listen now to what my heart says,      Chorus   Gee whizz it's you, you're the one that's makin' me blue   Gee whizz it's you, you're the one who can't be true      Little darlin' won't you hear my plea   Won't you please come back to me,   We can pick up where we started, listen now to what my heart says,   Ummmm - gee whizz it's you..........

"There are many obstacles that the builders face when creating the empire state building.  First off the height of the building more come into question as much and there were to many discussions about the Top of the building.  The empire state buildings first goal was to be the future of city they wanted to food people onto blimp.  another problem is where really is know way to get the blimp steady enough to stick to the building and the large aircrafts are not suppose to fly back close to the building because other building are around.

"The builders of the empire state building faced many obstacles. In the excerpt said ""the mooring mast of the empire state building was destined to fail."" A somehow unseen obstacle was the fact that ""most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen instead of helium"" which is a much more unstable gas and if a dirigible caught fire and went down over New York many civilians would be killed or wounded. Another obstacle the builders faced was ""the winds at the top of the building were constantly shifting."" This would make it very difficult to ancor a dirigible down to the mast and as the excerpt said they could not use lead weights hanging from the underside of the dirigible because they would be hanging over citizens below. Those are the problems faced by the builders of the empire state building..did you wake me?.

"Al Smith's dream of having airships dock atop the Empire @CAPS1 Building Was cut short by bitter reality. The idea failed parially due to the impracticality of docking a @DATE2 foot balloon filled with flamable gas to a city building. The mere size of this glimpse was astounding and this created many problems. Firstly The wind atop a skyscrapper is great and inconsitent. It is extremely difficult to dock to a building a seen when the Los Angeles tried to dock in @DATE1. The balloon was unable to dock due to potential damage it could cause to itself and the surrounding city. The blimps were also kept afloat by Hydrogen which due to its chemical nature is extremly flamable. Blimps had exploded in the past such as the Hindenburg. Engineers knew that if a similar accident occurred at the Empire state Building, substantial damage would have been done to the city and building itself. These impracticalities combined with the use of airplanes rather than blimps gaurenteed no blimps would ever be docked to the Empire State Building..But I get lots more pleasure when I'm playing with my uke..Life just went on for us   Day after day   We could fly!- oh!.Take me back   Take me back where I belong   That's with you baby   Ah take me back   Take me back where I belong   That's with you baby      I thought the grass was green on the other side   Thought the sun shone brighter without saying goodbye   There's a card in my hand   Tears fall like rain   I want to come home again   I want you to      Take me back   Take me back where I belong   That's with you baby   Take me back   Take me back where I belong   That's with you baby   Ain't no love in this world   Ain't no love in this world without you      In my search to find myself   I saw your face and nothing else   Every place I go everything I do   I still feel the need for you   Come on and      Take me back   Take me back where I belong   That's with you baby   Ah take me back   Take me back where I belong   That's with you baby      I'm on my way back to you   And I want to make it up to you   And all the problems that I caused you   If ti takes my life I'll make it up to you   I just want you to take me, take me   Take me, take me, take me, take me      Take me back, forgive me   Take me back where I belong   If you can, if you can find it   In your heart to forgive me.I've been the needle and the thread   Weaving figure eights and circles around your head   I try to laugh but cry instead   Patiently wait to hear the words you've never said      Fumbling through your dresser drawer   Forgot what I was looking for   Try to guide me in the right direction   Making use of all this time   Keeping everything inside   Close my eyes and listen to you cry      [Chorus]   I'm lifting you up   I'm letting you down   I'm dancing till dawn   I'm fooling around   I'm not giving up   I'm making your love   This city's made us crazy and we must get out      ""This is not goodbye,"" she said,   ""It's just time for me to rest my head."".She wakes up in the morning   In the same room that she's been in her whole life   And everything still looks the same   But the feeling of the room has changed in spite      She said   ""You don't know what it's like to be stuck in my mind""   She said   ""You don't know what it's like to be stuck in my mind all the time""      Bruised lips and the make-up   Tattooed hips and pierced   For the sake of letting everybody know   She don't belong here   Old tricks that she made up      Attitude   I don't give a fuck   For the sake of letting everybody know   She says I won't belong So long   It's not a lost cause   She's just a runaway      Is there nothing left for you to say?.My baby's gone, with the wind..This is the CENTRAL SCRUTINIZER   The White Zone is for loading and unloading only..The glow of your heart has been my lighthouse,   I've followed it in from distant shores,   Now I won't be afraid to love anymore..Go cry to someone else, I will walk away."
"Al Smith and his team of builders faced several obstacles when trying to allow dirigibles to dock at the top of the Empire State Building. The first problem with docking dirigibles is that the steel frame and foundation could not support The stress put on it by a dirigible attached to it. Also, when the builders looked back on past dirigible accidents like the Hindenburg, they realized that if an accident were to occur, many lives would be at stake. Furthermore, there were laws that limited how low a dirigible could fly over urban areas, so it would be illegal for a dirigible to dock at the Empire State Building because it would be too low. Finally, and according to the builders, most importantly, the largest problem with docking dirigibles to the Empire State Building was mother nature. Winds at the top of the building were very high and changed unpredictably, effectively turning the dirigible docked into a disaster waiting to happen..I just want you around,   I just want you around   I just want you around,   I just want you around      Thought that I had lost you   I could hardly make a sound   When I thought I couldn't hold you   Knew the world had let me down   Should have took the time and told you   You keep my feet on the ground   I hope that you can hear me   Cause I know it's not profound      I just want you around,   I just need you around   I just want you around,   I just need you around      When I thought I was without you   I got used to being down   Was my fault I used to doubt you   But that ain't me next time around   Please believe me when I tell you   Cause all my words are bound   This is my cross so let me bear it   I was lost but now I am found, found, found      I just want you around,   I just need you around   I just want you around,   I just need you around      Took this love for granted   Kept my feelings under ground   Should have watered what I planted   Should have known what I had found   I'm not used to being lonely   I don't like the way it sounds   You're the only one I know yeah   Who don't turn my upside down      I just want you around,   I just need you around   I just want you around,   I just need you around      [Repeat to Fade].""Yo baby, you wanna come to my crib?"".DJ's got us going around, 'round      Don't stop movin'   Find your own way to it   Listen to the music   Taking you to places that you've never been before, baby, now      Baby now   Baby now      And DJ's got us moving around   Right around, right around   DJ's got us moving around.Yeah, I'm naked   Oh oh, yeah yeah      I'm so naked around you   And I can't hide   You're gonna see right through, baby.What's left for you, my friend?.I know you need your sleep now      Ah, lover come and lie with me, if my lover is who you are,   And be your sweetest self awhile until I ask for more, my child..She visits my grave where the night winds wail..Who's all with me now?.Faces of people and places don't change."
"In the excerpt ""The Mooring @CAPS1"" by Marcia Amidon lusted theres alot of problems when trying to add a dock for dirigibles at the top. One problem or obstacle was the safety of the dirigible itself, ""most dirigibles from outside of the United States use hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly inflammable."" (@NUM1). Another obstacle was nature itself, ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" (@NUM2). The last problem was the existing law aganist airships flying too low over cities or urban areas. ""This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area."" (@NUM3). These are three reasons why in the excerpt ""The mooring @CAPS1"" by marcia Amidon lusted that there were alot of problems when trying to add a dock for drigibles....D.W.

"The builders of the Empire State building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Dirigibles were long; some were as long as one thousand feet. Dirigibles were docked by an electric winch, which hauled in a line from the front to the back. The architects could not drop a mooring mast on top of the building. A one thousand-foot dirigible held by only a single winch would be to heavy for the buildings frame. In order for it to work it would have to be strengthened to accommodate the one thousand foot dirigibles. This would be a process worth over sixty thousand dollars, just for the framework. Another obstacle was safety. Dirigibles out of the United States contained helium meaning it was highly flammable. If an accident would occur like in Lakehurst, New Jersey then a lot more people would be harmed considering downtown New York was densely populated. Other obstacles were made for the builders of the Empire State building which proves that it was not a good idea to dock dirigibles..I could swear it was her made me shift into high..Trying to get to this   Clocking, I got my own ideas,   And they ain't got nothing to do with what's in here   See ya next year, 91, in full effect   I'm getting ign'ant   (yeah, yeah)      We got our own ideas!.Wild, wild   The wild and the   Young, y-y-y-young      The wild and the young   They all have their dreams   The wild and the young   They've got to be free   The sun never sets   For souls on the run      The wild and the young   They all have their dreams   The wild and the young   They've got to be free   The sun never sets   For souls on the run   The wild and the young      Oh yeah      The wild and the young   Oh      Right.I get so nervous I'm shaking   Gets so I got no pride at all   Gets so bad but I just keep coming back for more   I guess I just get off on that stuff      I'm thinking about taking some time   I'm thinking about leaving soon      I got some things I can't tell anyone   I got some things I just can't say   They're the kind of things no one knows about   I just need somebody to talk to me      I'm thinking about leaving tomorrow   I'm thinking about being on my own   I think I been wasting my time   I'm thinking about getting out      In all this time,   The bottom line's you don't know how much I feel   You say you see but I don't agree   You don't know how I feel      I'm just trying to get myself some gravity   You're just trying to get me to stay   Sometimes I sit here looking down upon Los Angeles   Sometimes I'm floating away      I'm thinking about breakin myself   I'm thinking about getting back home   I think I been waiting for way too long   I'm thinking about getting out.Enough to make up for lost time..Then I'm gonna sit right here until I die..Goin' downtown, goin' down, goin' down   'neath the city, eatin' ground round   Underground is pretty gritty   I turned the screw she held the light   That's when I knew she was a      Sight for sore eyes   She was a sight for sore eyes      Playin' no fair, sleepin' under stairs   Downtown's a pity, takin' fair square   Under where it's pretty gritty   I turned the screw, she held the knife      Oh, holy jesus, she's a sight for sore eyes   Sight for sore eyes   She's a nitty grutty      Turnin' in style, walk a mile for your titty   Naked foul while under there   Under where it's pretty gritty   Hey, don't you know people   She's a love lust hussy   She left, oh she rust me   Dear old girl   She was a sight for sore eyes   But she was sittin' pretty   A sight for sore eyes   She was a nitty gritty   Sight for sore eyes      Peeled back and parted   Even at the start it was delight or demise   I feel like a leopard king   Sight for sore eyes   She was a sight for sore eyes.High above the city square   Globes of light float in mid-air   Higher still, against the night   Clockwork angels bathed in light      You promise every treasure, to the foolish and the wise   Goddesses of mystery, spirits in disguise   Every pleasure, we bow and close our eyes   Clockwork angels, promise every prize      Clockwork angels, spread their arms and sing   Synchronized and graceful, they move like living things   Goddesses of Light, of Sea and Sky and Land   Clockwork angels, the people raise their hands - As if to fly      All around the city square   Power shimmers in the air   People gazing up with love   To those angels high above      Celestial machinery - move through your commands   Goddesses of mystery, so delicate and so grand   Moved to worship, we bow and close our eyes   Clockwork angels, promise every prize      Lean not upon your own understanding   Ignorance is well and truly blessed   Trust in perfect love, and perfect planning   Everything will turn out for the best      Stars aglow like scattered sparks   Span the sky in clockwork arcs   Hint at more than we can see   Spiritual machinery.Morning to moonshine,   Monica knows every line."
"There were many different obstacles the builders of the empire state building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles. For example ""the wind on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Because of the weather itself it caused them not to be able to build the mooring mast. Another reason is ""using the empire state Building where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street was neither practical nor safe"". It could easily kill people that were roaming around. Lastly they could not more at the empire State Building because ""It was an existing law against airships flying to low over urban areas..Oh, oh, oh, shake, shake..My girl (my girl, my girl)   Talkin' 'bout my girl (my girl)      I've got so much honey the bees envy me   I've got a sweeter song than the birds in the trees   I guess you'd say   What can make me feel this way?.I've been living inside a hole, they kept me underground..Well if you sit down with this old clown,   Take that frown and break it,   Before the evening's gone away,   I think that we could make it,   And I hope that I don't fall in love with you..Once again she steals away   Then she reaches out to kiss me   And how she takes my breath away   Pretending that she won't miss me      Oh I would bleed to love her   Bleed to love her   Oh I would bleed to love her      And once again she calls to me   Then she vanishes in thin air   And how she takes my breath away   Pretending that she's not there      Oh I would bleed to love her   Bleed to love her   Oh I would bleed to love her      Somebody's got to see this through   All the world is laughing at you   Somebody's got to sacrifice   If this whole thing's going to turn out right      Oh I would bleed to love her   Bleed to love her   Oh I would bleed to love her.You started to take sides   They started arguing   He said it was her fault   She said it wasn't at all   But the truth lies somewhere in the middle..Chorus   As the world goes round, round, round,   Let the beat go down down down   Can we stay up all night,   Cuz we can sleep all day,   Everybody can come out to play,   Lemme hear ya say...

"During the construction of the mooring mast atop the Empire State Building the builders faced several obstacles. The greatest obstacle was @CAPS1 Nature. The winds at this height are shifting to frequently causing the dirigible to be tossed around the mast, making it unsafe to board. Another obstacle was how they weighed dirigibles down with lead weights. Having lead weights at this height was risky because they could plummet down upon the people below. The third obstacle was a law against the airships flying too low in urban areas. This made it impossible for any dirigible to dock or even come near the Empire State Building. These obstacles forced the builders to shelf the mooring mast construction..It's too late   This model's out of date   Got every spare part   But there ain't much heart inside here   Not like the start   I was good at the art of survival   I've always tried   To keep my troubles deep inside   Where I can hide them   now I'm open wide      When it ends   Again I'll see my friends   They'll give me a lift   I've been running adrift, so easy   Shifting the gear   I got nothing to fear from the showdown   I'll go down quiet   And kids downstairs making a hell of a din   I'm all alone   Getting a quote for the wages of sin      Beyond the indigo, indigo   Where the chilly winds, winds will blow   My time is running low   Going to cross the dark dark river   Going to see my good life-giver   Better cover my yellow liver      Alright,   I'm giving up the fight   I didn't know when   I'd be a stranger again   In my own land   The days are O.K..You say you want to kill yourself   It might make it just a little bit easier   You think you're the only one who hurts   Try looking just a little bit harder   I don't know why you're holding on   To the damage that's been done   'Cause you've got me wrapped up in your illusion   I keep on trying to change your conclusion   But you've got me wrapped up in your illusion   I keep on dying 'cause you're busy wasting life   Don't disguise your emptiness   By placing blame on me and everyone else   Protected by your safety nets   But you can't put the heart of your fears at rest   All I feel is deep regret for what you have become   You've got me wrapped up in your illusion   I keep on trying to clear the confusion   But you've got me wrapped up in your illusion   I keep on dying 'cause you're busy wasting   I keep on trying 'cause you're busy wasting life   You're busy wasting life   You're busy wasting life   I cannot go on this way   I bring no consolation for you and your pain   No one else can change your fate   You'll have to do it for yourself   You've got me wrapped up in your illusion   I keep on trying to clear the confusion   But you've got me wrapped up in your illusion   I keep on dying 'cause you're busy wasting life   You're busy wasting life,   You're busy wasting life, you've got me wrapped up   You're busy wasting life, 'cause I keep on trying   You're busy wasting life, you've got me wrapped up   You're busy wasting life, and I keep on dying.do that..I get a little scared as he starts to play his drum   On the skin of his hand, I see a little cut--blood      Night time in Budapest   So many things here are not what they seem   But we love them all   What a night to remember forevermore      What a magical mystery feeling   Dancing at the end of their silvery strings   Almost human in size   Like children with plague in their flesh   These puppets are so grotesque      The show has come to an end   The master himself is on the stage   With his children, the curtain must fall   And then the puppets they are gone.And when will mom stop kissing me   In front of all my friends?.Oh, ma hon-ey, oh, ma hon-ey, Let me take you to Al-ex-an-der's   Grand stand brass band, ain't you com-in' a-long?.""Well he is your own, kind sir"", she said, ""Do not think me strange,   Well that sovereign that you gave to me, I gives you back your change!!"".I'm tired, tired   Anybody care what I say?.I'm the realest nigga in here you already know   Got trapper of the year four times in a row (what they give you?)"
"There are many things in life that seem like they could be brilliant ideas but, in reality there are many flaws with it. One of these ideas is using the Empire State building as a mooring mast for dirigibles. This is what Al Smith, the governor of New York at the time, discovers in an excerpt from The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon Lüsted. In this excerpt the builders of the Empire State building had to face some serious obstacles to allow the docking of dirigibles: @CAPS1 building the Empire State building many of the blue prints had to be changed. One thing that had to be changed was the skeleton of the building. They needed a way to support the drigibles if they were to dock. The skeleton they had in place put too much stress on the top half of the building that it would result in breaking. Another thing that the builders had to deal with was the safety of the @LOCATION1. If the highly flamable helium inside the dirigibles then it would be putting thousands of peoples lives in jeopardy. Finally the builders had to deal with the violently shifting winds. This too put stress on the frame of the building since the winds were so strong there and also a fear that it would blow the blimp into the pointed mast and break the blimp. Overall there are many reasons why the Mooring Mast never became a reality..In the beginning I was far away and praying for my destiny..And I'll be (your comfort and your ease)..Have a little faith in me, oh   Have a little faith in me..Something's come, feel it down in my bones   Yeah it's been a long time gone, but ya here tonight   Now let's not look back, ya keeping me right on track   Feel the karma coming back, we're gonna be alright      If everything's a constant battle, sometimes you won't win   If all our strengths turn into struggles we won't be giving in      We'll be living on an all time high   I'm trying to keep it   We've learnt to walk but now it's time to run   A change is gonna come   Living on an all time high   I'm gonna live it   First thought we couldn't but it can be done   Change is gonna come      Troubled times, been a good friend of mine   Yeah it's been around a while keeping me down   But through it all, even with a broken soul   Here I am standing tall cause you're around      If everything's a constant battle, sometimes you won't win   If all our strengths turn into struggles we won't be giving in      We'll be living on an all time high   I'm trying to keep it   We've learnt to walk but now it's time to run   A change is gonna come   Living on an all time high      I'm gonna live it   First thought we couldn't but it can be done   Change is gonna come      For every sign that said we'd never find the means to   For every word they said they never heard that they knew   Given time I want some piece of mind   Same as you do   Sing it!.You are not innocent..Legs up to her shoulders   All the way back down   She's not playin', she knows what she's doin'   And the word's out on the town   She want to be a cheerleader   A cheerleader   She got the moves      She got the grooves   All the boys need her      Oh oh that's the way she wants to be   Cruisin' the touch line at a quarter to three   See her - she want to be a cheerleader      Now she's gettin' bolder   Now she gets around   She's not takin no for an answer   She's not getting down      She's a no teaser   A no pleaser   She got the drive   She got the jive   She's a big squeezer      Oh oh that's all she wants to be   Shake a little tush for the boys to see   Want to be her - a cheerleader   But what she wants the most   To be the perfect host   She wants to play the field all over      She needs it most of all   When it's too close to call   She wants to rock and roll all over   Yes all over      Legs up to her shoulders   All the way back down   She's not playin', she knows what she's doin'   The word's out on the town      She want to be a cheerleader   A cheerleader   She got the moves   She got the grooves   All the boys need her      Oh oh that's all she wants to be   Shake a little tush for the boys to see   Want to be her - a cheerleader      Oh oh that's all she wants to be   Cruisin' the touch line at a quarter to three   See her - she want to be a cheerleader      See, her, want to be a cheerleader.They'd gladly bid their dreary jobs goodbye for anything theatrical and why?.When grandma and grandpa   Get out on the floor   They rock until they drop   And then they rock some more   Yeah, everybody's rockin',   Well, everybody's rockin'   Everybody's rockin',   Rockin' to the dancin' beat..Now I know the rules."
"The idea of docking dirigables on top of The Empire State Building was a grand one It seems as though the dream of dirigable transportation was on it's way up, however, the architects were blinded by their excitement. Al @CAPS1 competitive nature not only pushed the building to a un-precedented 1,250 ft., but also combined transportation in new, fashionable, And effective ways. This not only made the public and architects excited, but also put a lot of expectations on the building. Al Smith did not see all the obstacles ahead that would halt his dirigible plans. One of the obstacles being that the swaying of the dirigible would add stress to the frame of the building, though the necessary precautions were made, the obstacle was foreshadowing the others to come. When the dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire due to the hydrogen gas, people became skepticle. What if it were to blowup over a crowded New York city street? Also, an existing law against aircrafts flying too low over urban areas prohibited the dirigable plans. The obstacles proved too much for the plan to go through. Though the plans were merely postponed by the late 1930's the idea of dirigables a top the Empire State Building had disappeared..I was cutting the rug   Down at place called The Jug   With a girl named Linda Lou   When in walked a man   With a gun in his hand   And he was looking for you know who   He said, ""Hey there, fellow   With the hair colored yellow   Whatcha tryin' to prove?.They are at peace with natures ways..Oh, my love, my darling, I've hungered, hungered for your (touch) a long,   lonely time (?).If you see the answer, now's the time to say..I wish that you could conceive..

"The obstacles the builders of the Empire State building faced were wheather. Nature itself would ruin the time frame of building. Winds would shift, even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast.Another challenge the builders ran into was that dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas..Questions are a burden   And answers are a prison for oneself   Shellshock in the kitchen   Tables start to burn..What would you sacrifice for reality?.It's nothing to see   But something's got you down on your knees   I'm crawling through the dirt to see where it hurts   And it ain't falling down by degrees   I think I'm gonna die   From trying to kick a hole in the sky   Your walls are plastered with ham-fist drunks   And fagans wrapped in denim and smoke   So tell me what chance did you happen to dance   With the step that kicked your feet in the boat?.These are the given lyrics for this song, but to my ears,   Most of the first verse sounds to me to be in German..of the light..Close your eyes, close the door   You don't have to worry anymore   I'll be your little baby tonight   Shut the light, shut the shade   You don't have to be afraid   I'll be your baby tonight   Well the mockingbird's gonna sail away   You won't regret it   The big fine moon's gonna shine like a spoon   You won't regret, you won't forget   To get your shoes off, do not fear   Bring that bottle over here   I'll be your baby tonight   Well the mockingbird's gonna sail away   You won't regret it   The big fine moon's gonna shine like a spoon   You won't regret, you won't forget   To get your shoes off, do not fear   Bring that bottle over here   I'll be your baby tonight   I'll be your baby tonight.I'm back in my baby's arms again I'm thankful too   I'm back in my baby's arms again that love is true   I'm back in my baby's arms again where I should be   Cause I know where I've been I was lost in sin   But I'm back in my baby's arms again      Well I hurt her so that I had to hide I would stay away not to face my pride   But she saw me through to the truth inside   And I'm back in my baby's arms again with the love that I stole   I'm back in my baby's arms again God bless her soul   I'm back in my baby's arms again and I know it's real      I pray the Lord I remember when cause it's better now than it's ever been   He came back to me like a long lost friend and I'm back in my baby's arms again   I'm back in my baby's arms again I'm thankful too....But the master of the sea   Heard my despairing cry   And from the waters lifted me   Now safe am I..Mona Lisa, Mona Lisa, men have named you."

"In ""The Mooring Mast"" many of the builders faced obstacles for attempting dirigibles to dock at the empire state building. Many of the reasons had to do with safety. Although the idea to dock dirigibles to the building sounded good many things could of gone wrong. The Empire State building was a enormous structure for it's time, even though it looked ideal for the mast to go on ""winds""  would be too dangerous for even the most skilled pilots to menuver the dirigibles. Also most of the dirigibles from other countrys such as @LOCATION2 used ""hydrogen"" in their blimps. Although the dirigibles were ""hailed"" as the transportation of the future, too many safety precautions had to be taken because of the densely populated area of New York City. For the dirigibles at the time they were a sound and good idea for transportation, but even though the structure of the Empire State building lookd good they still had to be care ful with the building and the people below, and for the German hydrogen filled blimps were not good terms of safety over a populated city..God of the Devils, God of the Devils   Won't you help them pray   God of the Devils, God of the Devils   Is there no other way      Can't you hear their souls calling out in their plight   Can't you see their blood is boiling setting them alight      Thirty years now sleeping, so sound   War raises its head, and looks slowly around   The Sinner is near, sensing the fear   And the beast will start movin' around      Can't you see their souls calling out in their brain   Can't you hear their blood is boiling setting them alight      Sinner, Sinner, Sinner, Sinner!.Brown baby brown baby   As you grow up I want you to drink from the plenty cup   I want you to stand up tall and proud   And I want you to speak up clear and loud   Brown baby brown baby brown baby      As years go by I want you to go with your head up high   I want you to live by the justice code   And I want you to walk down freedom's road   You little brown baby      So lie away lie away sleeping lie away singing   Lie away sleeping lie away safe in my arms   Till your daddy and you mama protect you   And keep you safe from harm   Brown baby      It makes me glad you gonna have things that I never had   When out of men's heart all hate is hurled   Sweetie you gonna live in a better world   Brown baby brown baby brown baby.Through restless foliage and tall trees he leads   To a house in a clearing, a place in her fear she calls home..I'm addicted to feeling   Stealing love isn't stealing   Can't you see that I understand your mind?.I had a spider woman   And she was so good   She chained me   In her web so tight   I lost the freedom   Of release that night   So I stayed right by her      I dreamt I saw a blind man   Who was singing a song   About a guy who   Couldn't take no more   And the meaning of   The words he swore   Told me go find her      She was a spider woman   But she was good to me   Spider woman   But she was good to me      I told her 'bout my vision   But she laughed in my face   So I told her go   And walk in the street   But by the time   She got past my feet   I lost control.Out of all the women in the world,   He belongs to only you..O little town of Bethlehem   How still we see thee lie   Above thy deep and dreamless sleep   The silent stars go by      Yet in they dark streets shineth   The everlasting light   The hopes and fears of all the years   Are met in thee tonight      For Christ is born of Mary   And gathered all above   While mortals sleep the angels keep   Their watch of wondering love      O morning starts together   Proclaim thy holy birth   And praises sing to God the King   And peace to men on earth.You're always there givin' me all you've got..And I tol' ya'   A long time before ya' ever came to be told,   ""You've got somethin'   That they all want to know."
"The builders of the empire state building faced several obstacles in their attempts to allow dirigibles to dock there. One being the changes in wind current. The dirigibles did have steering systems, and could be tethered however the wind could overpower these systems causing it to loose controll and crash. Another obstacle was the fear of another ""Hindenburg"" accident. On May 6, 1937, the hinden burg (a dirigible) that, like all other dirigibles, contained hydrogen (a highly flamible gas) was ignited and burned down, keeping the casualties mainly to the men and women on board, however, if this incident happened above the highly populated @CAPS1.Y.C. the number of deaths would increase due to the pedestrians below..Your blood in mine   We'll be fine   Then your body will be mine      Why would you die   Your blood in mine   We'll be fine   Then your body will be mine.Baby, you said,   Long as rivers flow   Each day you'd love me more..Mo boys, is you right   Done got it right   All I hate about linin' track   These ol' boys are gonna break my back      [Chorus:]   Mo boys, can't you line 'em (track a lack)   Mo boys, can't you line 'em (track a lack)   Mo boys, can't you line 'em (track a lack)   See Eloise gonna line 'em track      Down in the holler below the fleld   Angels working on the chariot wheel      [Chorus]      Mary and the babe was a sittin' in the shade   Thinking on the money that I ain't made      [Chorus]      Moses stood on the Red Sea shore   Gotta batten down the waves with a two by four      [Chorus]      Now if I could I surely would   Stand on the rock where Moses stood      [Chorus]      Matthew, Mark, Luke and John   All them disciples dead and gone      [Chorus]      Mo boys, is you right   Done got it right   All I hate about lining track   These ol' boys about to break my back      [Chorus].Do you want to dance   Would you take a chance with me   Let the music play   Dance your life away, be free   Don't you know that with the music   You're dancing all your troubles away   Do you wanna dance   Would you take a chance today   Do you wanna dance   Would you take a chance today   Come on baby   Do you wanna dance   Come on everybody   You've gotta take a chance   Come on baby   Do you wanna dance   Come on everybody      Please don't be so shy   Come on, just give it a try for me   Don't you feel the beat   It's as easy as one, two, three   Don't you know that with the music   You're dancing all your troubles away   Do you wanna dance   Would you take a chance today   Do you wanna dance   Would you take a chance today   Come on baby   Do you wanna dance   Come on everybody   You've gotta take a chance      Come on, lets, baby,   Please dance with me baby   I know you do it so good   I'll be waiting all night   Just to make you feel right   And now it's up to you   Come on and boogie with me   Come on baby   Do you wanna dance   Come on everybody   You've gotta take a chance.Do you try   To keep in touch?.Pull me up up up up up up up up!.Sleeping with an angel..Is it time for your medication or mine?.Sure weren't thinkin' bout me   Yeah, Sure weren't thinkin' bout me   I'm sure not thinkin' bout you"
"In the nonfiction article The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon Lüsted it gives information of the potential problems from the Mast. In @CAPS1 @NUM1 it says ""The steel Frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened."" This shows that at first the building was not strong enough to hold such weight. Another problem was nature. The workers had to take nature into effect. If they had a dirigible or a blimp up there the wind could potentially harm the dirigible. There was also a law in place that for bid aircraft to fly that low. Finally, workers had to make the height exceed any other height that was taller. In @CAPS1 @NUM2 says ""In December 11, 1929, he announced that the Empire... would reach 1,250 feet..."" John Tauranac also followed by saying ""Their top they said would serve a highe calling."" The builders had a lot to take in to effect they had height issues, frame and law issues. That they had to sort out..I can't find the words to say   Please don't be mad with me....I'm crying..Would you pat me on the back or would you criticize me?.Every dawn becomes a new day   A time to love, a time to cry   Every river knows its own way   And it's the same for you and I   And every heart must have a reason   A winding road, a midnight flight      [Chorus:]   Freedom, freedom   What we all need is freedom in our hearts   Freedom, freedom   What we all need is freedom in our hearts      We fight and die defending honor   The pride and prejudice we hide   A mother's tears, a father's anger   From trying to stop the pain and lies   So we pretend to look for answers   While I blame you and you blame me      [Chorus]      We don't need the pain anymore   To move our mountains, to reach our shores   What I've found is the choice I bring   What I can do to let freedom ring?.Desperate man, desperate times   Desperate heart   Once she was mine   Bad blood, cold sweat   The more I give, the less I get   She picked clean to the bone   Black ice, danger zone      Bad blood runs through her veins   She's got bad blood   She'll never change   I held on long as I could   But that girl, bad blood      Perfect crimes, no clues   That girl's just bad news   I held on long as I could   Bad girl, bad blood   She cut clean to the bone   Tight jeans, danger zone      Girl's got bad blood      Glass heart, fools gold   Her blood is stone cold   Held on long as I could   But that girl's just no good   She picked clean to the bone   Black ice, danger zone.C'mon!.Why?.Born for you, born for you baby..If your feeling froggy leap (oh)   I ain't even losin' sleep (oh)   There's more to me than what you see (oh)   You wouldn't like me when I'm angry      Mr."
"When the idea of making a mooring mast atop the Empire State Building was thought of, builders did not realize the obstacles that would have to be passed. One obstacle was ""nature itself. The winds, on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" This means that if a dirigible were to be tied up for loading and unloading, it could be moved around freely in the sky, making it dangerous for passengers to be on or around it. An example of the dangerous winds would be in 1930, the ""U.S. Navy dirigible Los Angeles approached the mooring mast but could not get close enough to tie up because of forceful winds. A concern for safety was that ""most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" If something wrong were to happen, there could be great consequences for the heavily populated downtown of @LOCATION2. A third and final obstacle that occurred was ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area."" Because of these obstacles, the idea to have dirigibles dock at the top of the Empire State Building seemed impossible, and was never accomplished..Well free you from the ghettos of your minds,   Well free you from your fears and binds,   We know you want things to stay as it is,   Its gonna change, baby..A-ha, me boys a-riddle-i-day!.Gwyneth Paltrow's half-Jewish,   But a full-time Oscar winner,   Jennifer Connelly's half-Jewish too,   And I'd like to put more in her!.Like some god damn fucking freak, I'm so pressured, I'm so worried,   Something takes a hold of me, something I can't believe..Chewed the bone down too low   Got fed on tea and sympathy   Blew the sail like the wind   I wish you were my enemy   I was humble for you   What a fool I've been to have   Laid so low for so long      Into that void of silence   Where we cry without sound   Where tears roll down   Where tears roll down   And where your mother's violence   Sent your soul underground   Where tears roll down   Where tears roll down      Drew the blade way too slow   Was shackled by your honesty   Made a mess, I guess I have should have known   That life was lust and liberty   Not a chance mutation or the last temptation   Laid so low for so long, so low      Into that void of silence   Where we cry without sound   Where tears roll down   Where tears roll down   And where your mother's violence   Sent your soul underground   Where tears roll down   Where tears roll down.Do I have to come right out   And say it, girl   Tell you that you look so fine?.I never did like that apartment it was not a place I like to be   In summertime the place was hot in wintertime I'd sit around and freeze   I never did like that apartment seems to me it always smell like food   People down the hall complained because I liked to pick and sing   And anyway the rent was overdue   Cloudy day this is my cloudy day   One for you and one for him one for her and one for them   This looks like a cloudy day for me   I've forgot the number of the Interstate that brought me to this town   I've been here for seven months and still I do not know my way around   Well I'd like to find a quiet place and trouble is I don't know where it's at   I don't know which way is best but I think I'll be headin' west   So I'll be walkin' where the land is flat   Cloudy day this is my cloudy day....U R The One   Verse 1   It was like 6 of us   3 in the Benz, 3 in the truck   On... 85 headed to the Plush   Ten minutes later when we pulled up   I parked the Benz, hit the alarm, glanced down at my rims   Tucked my pant leg in the tongue of my Tims   Hand in my shirt to reveal my gems   Proceeded to walk in   Just then I saw this   Magnificent misses, sippin' on a glass of Cris   With a couple of her friends gigglin' I knew      [Chorus]   U R the one   I don't give a damn   Even if ya got a man take my hand, girl   U R the one   Girl I know you'll understand   If u just give me a dance, take a chance, girl      Verse 2   Said, I know u got a few with u   Don't even trip I got my crew here too   Keep it real what u wanna do   I really wanna chill with u   Tell ya friends they can hop in the truck, we'll take the Benz   But if we split up maybe we can hook up again   U never know I guess that all depends   If I can get u from the floor to the door of my 6-0-0   2.0 momo's on low Pro's   So finish that Mo', get your coat   Tell ya girls c'mon let's go, 'cause      [Chorus]      U-S-H-E-R, say it   U-S-H-E-R, 1-2-3, say it      [Chorus]      U-S-H-E-R, say it   U-S-H-E-R, 1-2-3, say it.'Cause we've shared the laughter and the pain   And even shared the tears   You're the only one who really knew me at all      So take a look at me now   Well there's just an empty space   And there's nothing left here to remind me   Just the memory of your face   Ooh, Take a look at me now   Well there's just an empty space   And you coming back to me is against the odds   And that's what I've got to face,      I wish I could just make you turn around   Turn around and see me cry   There's so much I need to say to you   So many reasons why   You're the only one who really knew me at all      So take a look at me now   Well there's just an empty space   And there's nothing left here to remind me   Just the memory of your face      Now Take a look at me now   'Cause that's just an empty space   But to wait for you is all I can do   And that's what I've got to face      Take a good look at me now   'Cause I'll still be standing here   And you coming back to me is against all odds   It's the chance I've got to take   Take a look at me now"
"There are a few obstacles the builders faced when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building. One was the violently changing wind currents at the height the docking to place. This would move the blimp and possibly send it into another building, puncturing the side of the balloon. Dirigible after dirigible being docked would put a lot of stress on the building itself. It would disrupt the frame and possibly effect the building as a whole. Also most dirigibles outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium. Hydrogen is highly flamable as seen in the Hindenburg disaster. Due to all these reasons the mooring mast never saw a docked blimp..""Once the rockets are up, who cares where they come down?.In the cool of the evening when everything is getting kinda' groovy   I call you up and ask ""would you like to go and meet to see a movie?"".Lord!.Keep on keeping on, keep on keeping on..If I could stick my hand in my heart   And spill it all over the stage   Would it satisfy ya, would it slide on by ya   Would you think the boy is strange?.Darling, darling stand by me   Oh Won't You stand by me   Oh Won't You Stand, Won't You Stand, Stand By Me   Darling, darling stand by me   Oh Won't You stand by me   Oh Won't You Stand Won't You Stand Stand By Me   When the sky that we look upon crumble and falls   And the mountains tumble to the sea   I won't cry, No I won't cry   No, I won't be afraid   Just as long as you fuckin' Stand by me..Oh, but what good, what good,   Honey, what awfully good can it ever, ever bring,   Cause I can't find you with my love,   And I can't find you babe, oh anywhere..Do you wanna have fun?.Don't you know things can change   Things'll go your way   If you hold on for one more day   Can you hold on for one more day   Things'll go your way   Hold on for one more day      You could sustain   Or are you comfortable with the pain?"
"Many obstacles stood in the way of docking the dirigibles on the empire state. One obstacle the builders faced was the law stating airships couldn't fly too low over urban areas. Also, the builders would have to reinforce parts of the building to support the stress the dirigibles would place on the frame.Lastly, nature would not allow the dirigibles to be safely docked due to the fact the violent winds would shift the back of the dirigible making it sway wildly. These obstacles made sure that dirigibles could not be docked at the empire state..Help, I need somebody   Help, not just anybody   Help, you know I need someone   Help!, Help!.I got the worst seat on the plane (Yeah!).We are one, we are one   Distant rhythm in a troubled sky   Angry clouds divide the sun   Feels like thunder and so do I   Bloody silence has begun   Flying like a wounded dove      Tomorrow comes undone   Surrender don't come easily   We try to get over, over   Falling together, together      Many colors of the spirit   Many lives below the sun   We are colors of the spirit   We are many, we are one      Ask the question, what's goin' on   Why raging children run   Where's the father's legacy   Where's the harvest of the son   Close your eyes and tell me what you see   I see the same thing, same thing      Many colors of the spirit   Many lives below the sun   We are colors of the spirit   We are many, we are one   No, surrender don't come easily   We try to get over, over      Many colors of the spirit   Many lives below the sun   We are colors of the spirit   We are many, we are one   We are many, we are one.Never no more do I wonder,   Why you don't never play with me any more..Call that child James Lewis, call these rooms a home..It's so fast, Faster than sound   It's so fast, Faster than sound, whoa!.After all   We've been thru   We call it quits   And-a I'm about to   Wash my prints   Oh   The little I had left   He said it's over   And I could really go   For a cup of coffee   And an overdose      Leave it all behind me   You'll see it   When you finally find me   Comatose or pretty close   Cover up copy   And an overdose      I pop these pills   Like cracker jacks   And the price   That plays dice   Just watching you react   When your depressed you   Sleep too much   I'm not sure   If I'm waking up      It's over-rated   Over my dead body   Is how this will end   You said it'd over   And I could go   For another chance to do   This over again      So this is it?.You think It's You   Does God bleed on the word?.When I think of the dreams I've let slip through my hands   And the years that I've wasted Lord I've cried from my shame   But when I feel the glow of your love then I know   That I've done at least one thing that was good in my life."
"In the short story, ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles when building the mask. The entire steel frame of the Building would have had to be strengthened to hold the weight of the mast. The mast, which towered at over @NUM1 feet tall, would have stressed the steel frame of the Building, making its foundation weaker. To hold the mast, ""Over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework."" This meant that the builders had to really think through the process of how they were going to get the mast to not bend the steel frame. Another obstacle the builders faced was a new law that forbid airships from flying too low over urban areas, such as New York. Therefore, ""This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the Building or even approach the area. ""Because of this law, the mast was very rarely used. Regardless of what they tried, the builders would have to make big changes to the Empire State Building's framework in order to have the mast. However, the new law prevented airships from docking there, so the mast was not used as often as originally projected.

"Ambitious for its time, the idea of allowing dirigibles to dock at the top of the Empire State Building was doomed from the start.  The engineers and builders of the mooring mast were faced with many obstacles that could potentially inhibit safe docking at the top of the building. The first major obstacle was finding a way to tether the dirigible to the dock. As described in paragraph @NUM1, ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held on by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame.""  Modifications would have to be made to the entire building.  Another obstacle the engineers were faced with was stabilizing the dirigible once it was tethered to the building.  As described in paragraph @NUM2, ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" This would make it nearly impossible for passengers and crew to get on or off the dirigible.  These obstacles, baffled engineers and builders of the Empire State Building until the project was abandoned entirely..Legs scream at bikes and bikes scream at trucks   And motorists curse their lousy luck   Crossing guard's not doing his job   And traffic's not about to stop for the first causality   Of though it's the rules, it's the rules   Super farmer's bent on the cover of Time   The moralist screams he's all mine   So the bard isn't doing her job the vacuum night   The darkest rites the small quarantined thoughts   It's the rules, it's the rules   Salesman says this vacuum's guaranteed it   Could suck an ancient virus from the sea   It could put the dog out of a job   Could make the traffic stop so little thoughts can safely get across   It's the rules, it's the rules   Guaranteed or not it's the rules.Hearts made of stone will never brake   'Cause the love you have for them, they just won't take it   You can ask and plea, please, please, please break   And all your love is there to stay      These hearts of stone will cause you pain   Although you love there has stopped just the same   You can ask and plea, please, please, please break   And all your love is there to stay   But they'll say no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no   You daddy know, I thought you knew, hearts are made of stone      Hearts made of stone will never brake   'Cause the love you have for them, they just won't take it   You can ask and plea, please, please, please break   And all your love is there to stay   But they'll say no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no   You daddy know, I thought you knew hearts are made of stone.Hope you enjoyin' The Truth, The Way, The problem thus far..I told my Doctor something's wrong with me   She said gimme forty dollars and we'll look and see   Hop up on the table now we'll take some blood   Find out what you're dyin' of      She called me in the morning and she said now here are the facts   Well, it isn't your liver and it isn't your back   It's not your blood sugar or the Asian flu   That's not what killing you      You're dyin' of a broken heart   It really wasn't very smart   You lived through Nixon and a drug or two   Just to get your due   Dyin' of a broken heart      I called my analyst said I was a mess   He said gimme hundred dollars and we'll take a test   Lie down on the couch and tell me what you dream   It really isn't what it seems      You're dyin'   You're dyin' of a broken heart   And I'm cryin'   It really wasn't very smart   I lived through Nixon and a drug or two   Just to get your due   Dyin' of a broken heart      You're dyin'   You're dyin' of a broken heart   And I'm cryin'   It really wasn't very smart   I lived through Nixon and a drug or two   Just to get your due   Dyin' of a broken heart      You're dyin' of a broken heart   It really wasn't very smart   I lived through Nixon and a drug or two   Just to get your due   Dyin' of a broken heart   (Get your due)   Dyin' of a broken heart   (Get your due)   Dyin' of a broken heart   Dyin'   Dyin'   Dyin'.'Nother round, fill 'er up,   Hammer down, grab a cup, bottoms up!.When I get home from work, what do I do?.Watching the painter painting   And all the time, the light is changing   And he keeps painting   That bit there, it was an accident   But he's so pleased   It's the best mistake, he could make   And it's my favorite piece   It's just great      The flick of a wrist   Twisting down to the hips   So the lovers begin, with a kiss   In a tryst   It's just a smudge   But what it becomes   In his hands   Curving and sweeping   Rising and reaching   I could feel what he was feeling   Lines like these have got to be   An architect's dream      It's always the same   Whenever he works on a pavement   It starts to rain   And all the time   The light is changing.Well, you can't see where you're goin' in the pourin' rain   When you're runnin' into walls and feeling no pain   We've all done time with the devil and I've done mine   It took a while to get here but, I'm right on time..Only thing about me is the way I walk."
"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lüsted there are many obstacles that the builders stumble across. Many people would have a hard time with creating the docs for the dirigibles for the Empire State Building. One major obstacle that the builders had was ""The one obstacle to their expanded use in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area."" Another obstacle that they could come across is that the dirigibles could take to long to fuel up and could cause a jam with other dirigibles. Even though they had this huge obstacle they managed to get their way and they found a way to actually use the dirigibles without any types of problems..Why leave now?.Julie through the glass   I'm looking forward to   Doing things with you   For many years to come..The way it was in the past   A long, long time ago   Before staff levels dropped   They used to listen to the radio   And listen to the DJ's talk   About the songs they didn't know   As if it really mattered      Hit-pick or phone-in show   I don't want you to go tonight   Ten thousand watts of power   News headlines on the hour tonight   Our music beats the best   You just don't need the rest tonight   Once I couldn't care at all   But I can feel the ratings fall tonight   And 20 years ago   No-one seemed to care   The people must have known   The DJ's role was only there   To fill in space between the songs   That talk of love and other things   As if they didn't matter      Automatic stations came   And sent them all away   And now I'm left alone   I haven't got a word to say   And you're the one who makes the choice   To turn me on or turn me off   But now it really matters      Hit-pick or phone-in show   I don't want you to go tonight   Ten thousand watts of power   News headlines on the hour tonight   Our music beats the best   You just don't need the rest tonight   Once I couldn't care at all   But I can feel the ratings fall tonight      Hit-pick or phone-in show   I don't want you to go tonight   Ten thousand watts of power   News headlines on the hour tonight   Our music beats the best   You just don't need the rest tonight   Ten thousand watts of power   News headlines on the hour tonight.On the eleventh day of Christmas   My true love gave to me   Eleven Lords a leapin'   Ten ladies dancin'   Nine pipers pipin'   Eight maids a milkin'   Seven swans a swimmin'   Six geese a layin'   Five golden rings!.The sky is fallin' and the ground is reachin' up   The river's goin' by and the water's gettin' high and I feel like givin' up   Standin' in the downpour with these rainy day crossroad blues   Got those woods on my left, city on my right, don't want to sleep alone tonight again   Hole in my coat, hole in my shoes, sittin' in Mobile singin' the blues about you   Company people call my house most every day   Won't let a body concentrate   Gotta get some peace that way   Waitin' for that water risin', think I'll put my guitar in my boat   'Cause I'm floatin' to the nearest levy just to lay down   In that sand   Just pickin' wild berries, gettin' stung by honey bees   The Lord above and the devil below havin' a fight inside of me   Thinkin' ' bout my gun, maybe that will set me free   'Cause thunder and lightnin' are trapped inside of me   Innocent darlin' why you treat your daddy this way?.If you believe in me..Bittersweet, you're gonna be the death of me   I don't want you, but I need you,   I love you and I hate you at the very same time      See what I want so much, should never hurt this bad   Never did this before, that's what the virgin said   We've been generally warned, that's what the surgeon says   God talk to me now this is an emergency      And she claim she only with me for the currency,   You cut me deep bitch cut me like surgery      And I was to proud to admit that it was hurtin me   I'd never do that to you at least purposely      We breakin up again we makin up again   But we don't love no more   I guess we fuckin then      Have you ever felt like you wanted to kill her   And you mixed them emotions with tequilla      And you mixed that with a little bad advice   On one of them bad nights   You have a bad fight      And you talkin bout her family her aunts and shit   And she sayin muhfucka yo mama's a bitch   You know domestic drama and shit      All the attitude   Ill never hit a girl but I'll shake the shit out of you      But I'm a be the bigger man   Big pimpin like jigga man   Oh I figure it's      Bittersweet, you're gonna be the death of me   I don't want you, but I need you,   I love you and I hate you at the very same time      See what I want so much, should never hurt this bad   Never did this before, that's what the virgin said   We've been generally warned, that's what the surgeon says   God talk to me now this is an emergency      And my nigga says I shouldn't let her worry me   I need to focus on the girls we gettin currently   But I've been thinking and it got me back to sinking it   This relationship, it even got me back to drinking now      This Hennessey, is gon be the death of me      And I always thought that you havin my child was our destiny   But I can't even vibe wit you sexually   Cause every time that I try you will question me   Say ""you fuckin them girls, disrespecting me?.Why are the armies marching still that were coming home to me?.When you're alone it ain't easy,   You're like a dog that roams."
"The idea to put a mast on top of the empire building @CAPS1 like a brilliant idea. People thought it would be a great idea to dock a dirigible on the mast, expecially because ""New york city was the lack of Suitable landing areas."" But it is easy to @CAPS2 how the mooring mast would never be able to dock drigibles. One reason this could never happen is because @CAPS3 of these drigibles contained hydrogen in them wich is highly flammable. ""When the german dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in lakehurst, New Jersey.... the empire State building realized how much worst that accident could have been."" @CAPS3 people would die if this happened over a highly populated area. Another reason that the mast would never be able to be used is because there was, ""an existing law against airships flying too low or over urban areas."" @CAPS4 even if everything was Set up correctly they would be breaking the law flying there dirigibles @CAPS4 close to the city. But the most obvious reason is that the weather would be to unpredictable above the empire State building. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly Shifting due violent air currents."" The mooring mast would just be a tottally unstable place to dock these drigibles..My eyes, my evidence..It's just another day,   There's murder in the air....Just yesterday mornin', they let me know you were gone   Suzanne the plans they made put an end to you   I walked out this morning and I wrote down this song   I just can't remember who to send it to      I've seen fire and I've seen rain   I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end   I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend   But I always thought that I'd see you again      Won't you look down upon me, Jesus   You've got to help me make a stand   You've just got to see me through another day   My body's aching and my time is at hand   I won't make it any other way      I've seen fire and I've seen rain   I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end   I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend   But I always thought that I'd see you again      Been walking my mind to an easy time, my back turned towards the sun   Lord knows when the cold wind blows, it'll turn your head around   Well there's hours of time on the telephone line to talk about things to   Come   Sweet dreams and flying machines in pieces on the ground      I've seen fire and I've seen rain   I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end   I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend   But I always thought that I'd see you baby, one more time again, now      Thought I'd see you one more time again   There's just a few things coming my way this time around now   Thought I'd see you, thought I'd see you, fire and rain now   Na na na..La la la, la la lala,   La la la, la la lala,   La la la, la la lala,   La la la, la la lala..Are we bound out of obligation?.(All night mover) Just trying to put a little fun in their lives   (Winners, losers) You see them standing on the corner in the neon light - Aow!.I'll pay you well to do the trick      Doctor where's your magic box   There's no one here to count the cost   Name your price and make the sale   There's no-one here to tell the tale      Doctor please don't lock your door   I've never troubled you before   Just a pinch to ease the pain   I'll never trouble you again.I can't live that lie   Hate!.All you need is love, all you need is love,   All you need is love, love."
"The obstacles the builders fact was that they could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof. The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation. The Steel Frame of the Empire state Building would have to be modified and Strengthened to accommodate this new situation. The greatest reason was safety: most dirigibles from outside of the united states used Hydrogen rather than helium, and Hydrogen is highly flammable. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. The back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast. existing law against airships flying too low..This is the way, step inside..If i didn't love you   I'd be safe from harm..All hail the American night!.You see my new jobs a hassle, and the kids have the flu..Some are winners some are losers and some are fighters till the day they   Die some try to make a living some others always give in many are   Stopped before they get to try and many others are forced to leave their   Countries they lose their families they lose sleep as soon as they are   Gone they are forgotten but you see their tears crash on the beach you   Can see their tears crash on the beach you can see their tears crash on      Maybe a winner maybe a loser but I'm a fighter till the day I die   It took a lifetime to cross the breadline to be a victim of accusing   Eyes and many others are forced to leave their countries they lose their   Families they lose sleep as soon as they are gone they're forgotten but   You see their tears crash on the beach you can see their tears crash on   The beach you can see their tears crash on.Ladies of the night   Give me what you've got   I ain't looking for love   Just want some action!.You're no angel, I'm no saint, if we were   We wouldn't be in this place tonight      Lost and lonely, scared and confused   We both have a past, nothing to lose, tonight   Well it cuts like a knife these bad luck blues   We both got scars from the hell we been through   Somebody's gotta win, somebody's gotta lose      So let's roll the dice, one more time   Take a chance on love again tonight   Risk it all, lay it on the line   Let the skeletons fight for life   Tonight, hold on tight, as we collide      Reconnected, feelin' no pain   Seeking shelter like a spark in the rain, tonight (ooh yeah)   Worn and weathered, scared to go home   We're here together, but still all alone, tonight (uh uh yeah)   And there's no need to lie, we've both been abused   The love and the pain, the cocaine and booze, now   Most people don't, but some people do      So let's roll the dice, one more time   Take a chance on love again tonight   Risk it all, lay it on the line   Let the skeletons fight for life   Tonight, hold on tight, as we collide.I'd be frightened   I couldn't cope, just couldn't cope   I'd turn my head..Or if I were a bell I'd go ding dong, ding dong ding!"
"The Empire State building faced many obstacles while attempting to allow dirigables to dock there. This building being so tall, and large wind shifts were a constent worry. Wind shifts, is when the direction of the wind shifts suddenly. One minute its @LOCATION1, the next its @LOCATION2. On may 6, 1937, when German dirigible Hindenburg, caught on fire, people thought, what would have happened if that was over the empire state building. over New York, with such a large population, it would have been hectic.

"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles when it came to allowing dirigibles to dock on the mooring mast of the building. They first had to do modify this top as a mooring mast and the steel frame of the building had to be modified to accomadate the dirigible. They also had to make a docking and ticketing area, which also costed money. They also had the problem if the dirigible hit something or caught fire by its hydrogen gas. Nature itself was the biggest problem because near the building, winds were violent. There also was a law stating that dirigibles or airships couldn't fly too low over urban areas. If the shell broke, the dirigible could hurt many people..Tell me you've had trouble sleeping   That you toss and turn from side to side   That it's my face you've been seeing   In your dreams at night      Tell me that you wake up crying   And you're not sure exactly why   Tell me that something is missing   In your life, in your life baby      Tell me that you live for love   That forever is never enough   That you've waited all your life to see   That you want so badly to believe   Tell me that it's not just me      I could have sworn I saw you smile at me   Standing in the pouring rain   At a loss for words and running out of time   I said this crazy ting (crazy thing), I said      Tell me that you live for love   That forever is never enough   That you've waited all your life to see   That you want so badly to believe   Tell me that it's not just me      Hold me now and tell me that you do believe   In a soul, a soul mate   And tell me, and tell me, tell me      Tell me that you live for love   That forever is never enough   That you've waited all your life to see   That you want so badly to believe   Tell me that it's not just me.It's like I got it back   Runnin' down the road   With a pistol in your hand   Whoa, no, you are the Babylon   Come down   One of one of these days   I'm gonna leave you for   Whoa, no, oh, yeah, go down   Bring it down now, bring it now   Yeah, I want some more, I want some more   Let me know, girl, let me know   Won't you let me know   If you wanna go for a ride?.[Chorus]   You can do ya thang shawty its okay   To floss but its still one rule player don't get caught..No, no, babe, I got blood in my eyes for you,   No, no, babe, I got blood in my eyes for you..It's our last chance   It's our   Last chance""      Now that you're gone I'm trying to take it   Learning to swallow the rage   Found a new girl I think we can make it   As long as she stays on the page      This is not how I want it to end   And I'll never be open again      ""I was gonna move out, get,   Get a job, get my own place,   But, I go into the mall where I   Want to work and they tell me, I'm,   I was too young""      ""Some people, gave advice before,   About facing the facts, about   Facing reality..Girls have picked them every one   When will they ever learn?.The earth dies screaming   The earth dies screaming   Your country needs you, lets strike up the band..I'm gonna kick your butt!.'Cause I could've gone with Charlie   In the side of his Harley   Mamma's on the phone with a stylist (Fuck Charlie!)"
"There were many obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock, there. They had known that the mooring mast wasn't perfect. There were many reasons but the greatest one they said was the safety. The hydrogen in them is highly flammable and after the accident in New Jersey in 1937, they noticed how much more dangerous it would be if it happened right in New York. So they dropped the idea later on and left the transportation to the airplanes..I tried to love you my way,   But I couldn't make it hold..Man deh pon di ends, till twenty-seven past nine..I need you to hear me   I want you to feel this   It should be clear as fear and plain as day   I'm not going to bend now   You're not gonna break me   You'll never be hard enough to scratch my face      I wanted to feel you   I tried to belong here   Well all of the ghosts and faded headlines   But I couldn't read you   No you wouldn't let me   You always pull away   From the ones you can't defy      Are you tired   Of holding up the sky?.What you offer has me   Ask me how it feels to vie      Your an unfenced fire   Over walls we travel   Its you I admire   My living example      Its a photograph discovered a decade after   Its a cannon blast disguised as a firecracker   Its enough to bring a brick wall to its knees   And sing, please      Could you move in slow motion?.If you multiply each love   A million times more,   It won't be half the love   That a mother has for:   Baby shoes, baby shoes,   Mother will never forget them,   You have forgotten   When your feet were bare,   Mother remembers,   She still has a pair   Of baby shoes, baby shoes,   To keep them,   The world she'd refuse..Nothing compares to the promise I have   In you..Maybe if you let a playa hit tonight   I may say   If lickin it right?.Go woman go go woman go   There you stand to tellin' me you're gettin' tired of me   You're sayin' that I've changed up not the way I used to be   Well there's some things I wanna say I think you ought to know   And then I think I'm gonna let you go woman go   [ dobro ]   I stood by and watched you as you tore my honor down   I even bought the clothes you wore to go out on the town   I thought you'd have your fling and settle down but now I know   That all you ever wanted was to go woman go   [ dobro ]   Now there you stand to tellin' me you're walkin' out the door   You're sayin' that you've had it that you can't stand me no more   You're thinking that I'll take you back the way I did before   But not this time I've set your free to go woman go   Woman go woman go woman go woman go.On a quiet summer day long ago and far away   Two tiny tots their game of play did end,   As they gazed into the sky where the lazy clouds go by,   The little girl said let's just play pretend."
"In the short excerpt, The Mooring Mast By Marcia Amidon Lüsted there were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. An obstacle they faced was the space. An example ""The one obstacle to their expanded use in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area."" @CAPS1 saying it was going to be hard finding a place to land. Although that may had been one of their problems that was not the only problem it was the safety. The excerpt says, ""the mooring mast added to the top of the building would allow dirigibles to anchor there for several hours for refueling or service and to let passengers off and on."" Which meant it would have taken along time just land and fueling. Another obstacle was for the dirigibles to be tested in the testing of the mast.Looking back on the memory of   The dance we shared 'neath the stars above   For a moment all the world was right   How

"The builders of the Empire State Building faced a few obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The biggest obstacle was finding a safe way to do it. New York City is a very densely populated area so any type of accident would be horrific, as the owners realized in @CAPS2 @NUM1, ""When the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, on May 6, 1937, the owners of the empire state building realized how much worse that accident couldve been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as @CAPS1."" Another obstacle was nature itself. The wind at the top of the building was too strong as it says in @CAPS2 @NUM2, ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currants. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around the mooring mast."" Safety was clearly the biggest concern.Give me little drink from your loving cup..Union Union Union City blue.Don't want nothing from no one..Or you will be damned to spend your life in hell..I know I should be going somewhere, I just can't arrive ..It doesn't mean that much to me   To mean that much to you..Sittin' in the mornin' sun   I'll be sittin' when the evenin' comes   Watchin' the ships roll in   Then I watch 'em roll away again      I'm sittin' on the dock of the bay   Watchin' the tide, roll away   Sittin' on the dock of the bay   Wastin' time      Left my home in Georgia   Headed far for Frisco Bay   I had nothin' to live for   Looks like nothin's gonna come my way      So I'm just gonna sit on the dock of the bay   Watchin' the tide roll away   Sittin' on the dock of the bay, wastin' time      Looks like nothin's gonna change   Everything, everything remains the same   I can't do what ten people tell me to do   So I guess I'll remain the same      I'm sittin' here restin' my bones   And this lonliness won't leave me alone   It's Two thousand miles I roamrd   Just to make this dock my home      Now, I'm just gonna sit at the dock of the bay   Watchin' the tide roll away   Oooo - wee, Sittin' on the dock of the bay   Wastin' time....Break it down again..Say you won't leave me for no other man   Say you'll love me just the way I am   Say you will baby, now   Say you will, just say you will      When I was born   My mother died   She said,'Bye bye, baby, bye bye   And since that day   I've paid my way   The notorious boy of the wild   Adopted by the wolves   When he was a child."
"During the @DATE1's technology and engineering wasn't quite as advanced. So it's safe to say builders of the Empire State Building had so obstacles.

" The builders of the Empire state building faced obstacles in order to attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. One issue was that the winds at the top of the building were very dramicaclly shifting because of the air currents. Because of this the Dirigible end would swivlle around the top of the building. An other issue was the people walking the @CAPS1 of New York below the building. To stop a Dirigible heavy lead weights had to be used. This was problamatic because one of the weights could very easily come lose and @DATE1. The law that was about a flying airship lingering too low over a city would be broken if a Dirigible had been stationd at the Empire State building..Just listen to teacher   I know it sounds sordid   But you'll be rewarded   When at last I am given my dues!.Just when I think I'm king, I must admit,   (I just begin.).It's decent enough,   You got what you wanted..I'm the wise wizard of the microphone swinging it   Here's a mean joint, all the hip-hoppers are singing it   Doing a dance in tight bike pants   So get up on it (hoe!).Maybe tonight,   I will say what's on my mind,   But the words are, oh, so hard to find..Or is this your way to hide a broken heart?.Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah!!!.My box is full   And my mouth is full   And my life is full   And now my memory's full      In how many ways and words   Can you say nothing   Millions of ways and words   To say nothing      What'd I say?.The last color   The last Canada girls   Who were you?"

"The obstacles the builders had to face where rational, but there are some things you sould think of first, such as peoples safty, aircraft hight limets, and wind. They they thought about how to dock it, How to get the passengers safly to the landing area. What they did work on was smart though, they had the the thing that connects the dirigibles to the dock, the electric winch. They had a baggage, and ticket area. What they thought of was smart, but the other stuff first..Put on your hi-heel sneakers,   Put your wig hat on your head, yeah, yeah..Gimme all of your lovin' - Oh live a bit   Gimme all that you got, whoa, live a bit   You've got to live it, gimme all of your lovin'   Ooh baby live it, gimme all that you got   C'mon and give it, ev'ry bit of your lovin'   Oh come on and give it, never want it to stop      Oh are you gettin' it?.Whatever you've got..But she looks just like you      Oh, you should've seen the way he stroked her hair,   And the smile that lit her face   You shoud've seen the way he kissed her lips   Did it have the same sweet taste?.But life will always go   Around, around, around, around   Around, around, around, around   Around, around, around, life goes around..Goodbye blackberry way   I can't see you, i don't need you..You never tell your family, you never tell your   Family because, you know, ol' Junior, he's got no brains, and what can   You do?.It don't cost a thing 'cause it's everywhere   You can take it back home and nobody cares   You can throw it and kick and it don't even hurt   So a kid's best friend just got to be dirt..Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, yeah."
"The original plan for the Empire State Building was to be tallest building in the world, at @NUM1 feet. Everything was going well until the competition. The Chrysler Building, threatened to steal the title. When Al Smith announced that he was going to but a mooring mast at the top of the Empire State Building, this obviously changed the architects designs. ""The architects desighned a shiny glass & chrome-nickel stainless steel tower that would be illuminated from the inside, with a stepped-back desighn that imitated the overall shape of the building. The rocket-shaped mast would have four wings at its corners... and would rise to a conical roof that would house the mooring arm."" (Lüsted). Two months after the workers started with the new plan, the celebrated because the finished framing the entire building ""The Empire State building was destined to never fulfill its purpose, for reasons that should have been apparent before it was ever constructed. The greatest reason was safety."" (Lüsted).So call me a fool, call me insane..I'll know when my love comes along   I'll know then and there   I'll know at the sight of his face   How I care, how I care, how I care   And I'll stop, and I'll stare, and I'll know   Long before we can speak   I'll know in my heart   I will know and I won't ever ask   Am I right, am I wise, am I smart?.I fell in love down in Mexico,   Thunderbird wine's the only way to go..Out of the darkness the voices are calling   Riding the wings of a song   The fury is screaming and Heaven is falling   I feel it coming on strong..1977 and we are going mad   It's 1977 and we've seen too many ads   1977 and we're gonna show them all   That apathy's a drag      My mind is like a plastic bag   That corresponds to all those ads   It sucks up all the rubbish   That is fed in through by ear   I eat Kleenex for breakfast   And use soft hygienic Weetabix   To dry my tears      My mind is like a switchboard   With crossed and tangled lines   Contented with confusion   That is plugged into my head   I don't know what's going on   It's the operator's job, not mine   I said      My dreams I daren't remember   Or tell you what I've seen   I've dreamt that I was Hitler   The ruler of the sea   The ruler of the universe   The ruler of the supermarket   And even fatalistic me.And god knows that I,   I would finish him,   Diminish him,   End up killing him..How sad the heart when it has won..I'm coming up quick, cause broke niggas need cash   At last, I'm at the top, so I maintain now   Gotta bang now, nigga this Doggystyle   [Snoop Doggy Dogg]   All she ever wanted was a small time, love thang   Got my homey caught up in the dope game, coke game   He so sprung, on top of that he young   He's only thirteen years old, and the world's so cold   He never took the time-out to fall down on his knees   Until he fucked his G, got some keys, now they's enemies   The niggas he grew up with, they put him in the game   Now they 'bout to take him out the game   Man it's a shame, but you know how that shit go   That's life in the fast lane, that's why I roll ??.Who's this gentleman?"
"As the Empire State Building was being built to allow dirigibles, or blimps, to dock there, the workers faced several problems in trying to accomplish this. The first of these obstacles to occurr to the workers was the framework of the building. The building needed to be sturdy enough for the blimp to dock there with the harsh winds constantly pushing the blimb in different directions. Without the proper frame work, it would be extremely dangerous to dock. The next obstacle for docking was the hydrogen gas powering the dirigibles. Hydrogen is extremely flammable, and there had been other previous accidents with hydrogen blimps. The workers realized that an accident with exploding blimps would be very dangerous in a such ""densely populated area."" The final obstacle workers faced was the harsh wind currents at that altitude. The winds were so strong, that the blimps could not even get close enough to dock. The workers suggested weighting down the blimp would lead weights, but seeing as the weights ""would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street,"" it ""was neither practical nor safe."" Trying to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building seemed like a good idea. As time went on the obstacles preventing this became to great and finally shut down the idea. .I got a girl, she lives on the hill..That was funny wasn't it?.All right?.And trust your feelings it easy now..If you just don't talk to me, babe      It flows through my head   The question is she needed   And decide all the man I can ever be..We are a new creation, the old has gone, the new has come..Why don't you open up your heart?.Write a review   Well how objective can I be?.We had a fight   A lover's quarrel   Angry words spoken in haste   Deep in the night   It went out of control   And with tears streaming down my face   I slammed the door and I walked out   Swearing that we were through   Now I'm sitting in a bar   Thinking I've gone too far   Wondering what I'm gonna do   Thinking about calling you      [Chorus]   To my left blue collar   To my right a high dollar man   Across the bar a smooth bartender   Who thinks I'm in the palm of his hand   Well they buy me drinks   Light my cigarette   They're all wondering which one I'm gonna choose   Oh my hand's on my glass   My second margarita   And my mind is on you   My mind is on you      Well I ran away   In a moment of weakness   I couldn't hold my own   I should stay   Because being together   Means more than who was right or wrong   And sitting in a room full of lonely faces   You're the only one I see   If you only knew   I was thinking of you   Would you come and rescue me   Maybe I should call and see      [Chorus]      (My third margarita)      I should of known I could never get along   Outside of your love   It's last call   And I'm out of cigarettes   They are all wondering what I'm gonna do   Oh my hand's on the glass   It's my last margarita   And my mind is on you   My mind is on you   My mind is on you"
"Based on the excerpt, the builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle was lack of suitable landing area; ""so were as long as one thousand feet, the same length as four blocks in New York City."" Another obstacle was the wieght of a mooring mast. ""The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened,"" which means they would have to modify the whole frame to bare the weight of the mooring mast which would cost over sixty thousand dollars.Safety was also an issue. Most dirigibles outside the United States used hydrogen. Hydrogen is extremely flammable, so if it caught fire over a highly populated area such as downtown New York than the accident would be much worse. Another issue was the fact that ""the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" Because of the wind the dirigible would swivel around the mooring mast..In Wiakill in Madrid and Seville they Fandango..I still remember every hour   Every second has been ours   Far away from any burden   We met eyes without a curtain   Headless into a new sensation   Weather brain nor fear or patience   Careless we had a game to play   You crossed my way for twenty days   Why don't you just heal   The yearning that I feel?.I never knew we could be so kind to each other..I've heard it too many times to ignore it..CHOP!!!!.Stand back!.Be what you want to be..All your yesterdays, shining bands of gold   With the Guardian that hangs on the Pine We are Children   of those who left their Mark With the Power to Smash !.Who wins?"
"When constructing a building, workers will face tough obstacles, ecspecially when it comes to building the Empire State Building. In attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there, Al Smith and other architectural builders faced many problems. As stated in paragraph @NUM1, dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State building because there was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. Also, as stated in paragraph @NUM2, the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Both of these obstacles were reasons that explain the failure of the mooring mast. The builders were not successful at their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building..I said baby, baby..Behind!.No mom, I don't know I called her tonight   No, not at home, yeah, you're probably right   Yes I'll take care of myself..Give me a reason to get out alive      Give me a reason cause' I got nothing to gain   So what are we doing now?.Isn't it a lovely ride?.Drive west on Sunset   To the sea   Turn that jungle music down   Just until we're out of town      This is no one night stand   It's a real occasion   Close your eyes and you'll be there   It's everything they say      The end of a perfect day   Distant lights from across the bay   Babylon sisters shake it   Babylon sisters shake it      So fine so young   Tell me I'm the only one      Here come those Santa Ana winds again      We'll jog with show folk on the sand   Drink kirschwasser from a shell   San Francisco show and tell   Well I should know by now      That it's just a spasm   Like a Sunday in T.J.

"In the excerpt of ""The Mooring Mast,"" many obstacles created problems for the builders of the Empire State building and their goal of allowing dirigibles to dock there. The first obstacle that came across the builder's minds was that they ""could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State building's flat roof,"" (paragraph @NUM1) because it would damage the building with the ammount of pressure pulling on the structure. The second problem that the architects faced was safety. Events from the past such as Hindenburg was caused by the use of ""hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable...the owners of the empire state building realized how much worse the accident could've been."" The next problem that came up was nature itself, such as dangerous winds. An event when ""the U.S. Navy dirigible, Los Angeles approached the mooring mast but could not close enough to tie up because of forceful winds."" @CAPS1 there were legal issues, and existing law was against airships flying too low over urban areas, making it illegal..You can't hold me!).I don't want to make you cry..Carl: No you can't, sir..I've been up all night, you've been puttin' up a fight..Let fortune..Well, ride me babe   Hang on to my hat   Ride me babe   Hang on to my hat   I'll howl like a wolf   Scream like an alley cat..My sources say the road is clear,   And street signs point the way..Hallelujah!.Latley I've been spendin' lots of time with my kid   Tellin' him stories   About the things that we did   When we were a family      Long time ago   I've answerd his questions   'Til I'm blue in the face   Wish all that hurt in him      I could erase   But I tell him the truth   Cause he ain't to young to know      [Chorus]   Single father   Part time mother   When I'm not one   Then I'm the other   You used to be   My full time lover   Now I'm a single father   And a part time mother   I spend every minute   I can with my boy   There's no doubt about it   He's my pride and joy      Someday he will grow up   And I won't have him no more   Some things I just find   Too hard to explain      So we go to mcdonalds   Or I buy him a train   And we go put it together   On the living room floor      Such is the life   Of a single father   He says daddy explain   If it's not too much bother      While its just you and me   Living here in this home   I don't understand it   And neither does he      Why there's just two   When there should be three of us   Sharing this moment   Lord I feel so alone      [Chorus]"
"The builders of the Empire state building faced the problem of how to keep the back end of the blimp from swaying in the wind. They were unable to solve this problem, as we see in paragraph @NUM1 where it says: ""Even if the derigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" Another problem with docking blimps on the Empire State building was a law that stopped dirigibles from flying too low over populated areas. There is proof of this in paragraph @NUM2 where it says ""The other practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" One more problem with mooring dirigibles on the Empire State was that it was hard for pilots to dock their ships on the mooring. An example of this is in paragraph @NUM2 where it says ""The U.S. Navy dirigible Los Angeles approached the mooring mast but could not get close enough to tie up because of forceful winds."".Covered the carcass of time with flowers   To send the scent of blame to the grave   Set the darkest thoughts on fire   And watched the ashes climb to Heaven's gates      We hide behind the crimson door   While the summer is killed by the fall   Alive Behind the crimson door   While the winter sings: ""Your love will be the death of me""   ""Your love will be the death of me""      Death served wine for lovers   Brought from the world where devils reign   And intoxicated angels with sorrow   They witnessed in the eyes of their slaves      We hide behind the crimson door   While the summer is killed by the fall   Alive Behind the crimson door   While the winter sings: ""Your love will be the death of me""   ""Your love will be the death of me"".I felt picture perfect   On and off a shelf to a broken frame of mind, a broken frame of mind   It comes back and haunts me   A bullet undercover, it fooled me every time, it fooled me every time      But even if I lose it all   I've got so much left to give, I won't give up, no, no   My heart's on the front-line, I'm not afraid      I will love you   Like I've never been hurt   Run through fire for you   Like I've never been burned..Hello from the gutter..Do you think we can talk about it some more?.Yeah yeah!.Are you dancing with Benjamin Franklin   On the face of the moon?.Well I have a feeling (I had a dream) things ain't going right (I had a dream)   Come over baby (I had a dream) let me tell you about my dream last night (I had a dream)   I dreamed someone else (I had a dream) was here with you (I had a dream)   Doing all the things (I had a dream) that I used to do (I had a dream)   Please don't let this dream come true (I had a dream)   Tell me I'm not losing you (I had a dream)   Baby, say it was a dream (I had a dream, I had a dream)      Well, well you know I came home (I had a dream) and found you gone (I had a dream)   I never felt so (I had a dream) so all alone (I had a dream)   Oh with your voice (I had a dream) ringing in my ear (I had a dream)   I just could not hold (I had a dream) hold back my tear (I had a dream)   Please don't let it come true (I had a dream)   Tell me I'm not losing you (I had a dream)   Oh, say it was a dream (I had a dream, I had a dream)      Well, well, well it seems (I had a dream) that you love me no more (I had a dream)   I never felt (I had a dream) felt this way before (I had a dream)   You were so cold (I had a dream) I wonder why (I had a dream)   You didn't care (I had a dream) how much I cried (I had a dream)   Baby please don't let it come true (I had a dream)   Won't you say that I'm not losing you (I had a dream)..One for the two lump, three lump, four..And every song that sings about it   Says that we can't live without it   Now I know just what that really means."
"Based on the excerpt, the obstacles the builders faced while attempting to build the dirigible dock at the Empire State Building were: finding a way to make this building bigger than the Chrysler Building, Designing the mast and @CAPS1 the reality. Al Smith needed a way to make is building bigger than the Chrysler building. He came up with the idea with putting a mooring mast on the building. The idea seemed great. While designing the mast, architects realized they can't just place the mast right on top of the building. They'd have to modify the foundation. After changing the skeleton of the building, construction went on as planned. Two month later the mast was finished, but the architects forgot that most dirigibles use hydrogen which is highly flammable. All the work the architects put in was for nothing because the mooring mast was never used..I've listened to nothing that life had to tell me,   Watched all my dreams rise and fall..I know you tried your best to love me   You smiled when your heart told you to weep   You tried to pretend that you were happy   But last night I heard you crying in your sleep      You gave the best years of your life dear   And each precious vow you tried to keep   I love you so much I want you happy   But last night I heard you crying in your sleep      Your heart is yearning for an old love   With new love its useless to compete   It hurts me to know you are unhappy   But last night I heard you crying in your sleep      You know that you are free to go dear   And don't mind if I start to weep   I know I can never make you happy   Cause last night I heard you crying in your sleep.Hungry Eyes         I've been meaning to tell you   I've got this feelin' that won't subside   I look at you and I fantasize   You are mine tonight   Now I've got you in my sights      With these hungry eyes   One look at you and I can't disguise   I've got hungry eyes   I feel the magic between you and I      I want to hold you so hear me out   I want to show you what love's all about   Darlin' tonight   Now I've got you in my sights      With these hungry eyes   One look at you and I can't disguise   I've got hungry eyes   I feel the magic between you   And I've got hungry eyes   Now I've got you in my sights   With these hungry eyes   Now did I take you by surprise      I need you to see   This love was meant to be      I've got hungry eyes   One look at you and I can't disguise   I've got hungry eyes   I feel the magic between you   And I've got hungry eyes   Now I've got you in my sights   With those hungry eyes   Did I take you by surprise      With my hungry eyes.I been walkin' the road,   I been livin' on the edge,   Now, I've just got to go   Before I get to the ledge..Religious death, I instigate   From what the bible demonstrates   Does it document creation   Of this hopeless infliction   Of a godless heretic   Not a god-fearing lunatic   Not a god-fearing lunatic   That's why it's become my obsession   To treat God like an infection      My scars insane, my life profane   I deny, defy, and spread a little hate, worldwide!.The guy's a cowboy from some rodeo   Doin' the things that we want to   The girl had once loved him, but now she want to go   Doin' the things that we want to ....Or does it beat for you alone?.Oh baby,   I know your givin' it, I know she's gettin' it..Whatchu want to do?"
"The builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The main obstacle was that the builders couldn't @CAPS1 put the mooring mast on the Empire State Building, because it had a flat roof. The mooring mast would put pressure on the building's fram. To overcome this obstacle the architects had to modify and strengthen the frame. More than sixty thousand dollars' went into the modifications of the framework. The greatest obstacle though was nature, and there was nothing the builders could do about that. The violent air currents caused winds on the top of the building to constantly shift. In open fields dirigibles could be weighted down in the back using led weights, but with pedestrians around it wouldn't be practical nor safe. Without being weighted down the dirigibles would swivel around..It's the return of the motha fuckin' ying yang twins   And you know this is your boy Collipark   And we back on the fifth L.P.

"While building the Empire State Building the architects were faced with many obsticles when the decision was made to use the Empire State Building to talk, load, and refule dirigibles.  How to dock a dirigible to the side of a building was one of the biggest concerns, but the amount of stress this would cause was an even bigger worry.  But the greatest obsticle to this project was the wind, nature itself.  The fear was that the wind would blow the dirigible into a neighboring building, and tethering the dirigible was not an option for safety reasons.  Due to the architect's inability to overcome these obsticles the Empire State Building was never used for it's original purpose..I can't find any shade but   I'll be swayed as long as   I've got a switchblade..With a flick of the tongue   She made her scream   She made her laugh   She made her dance   She was happy for the first time   And you know she wanted more      Now with her legs spread wider   She needed to have Louise inside her   She said ""I'll never forget the first time   You kissed me, now I want you to fist me."".There to approach the glory of my God,   Come towards to seek your face..All I know can be shown by your acceptance of the fact there shown before you..Cold house   Just before dawn   Oh my God   This feels so wrong   Clouds roll in   And cover the sun   A new day begins   Day one      Day one   And it already feels like forever   It's over and done   So what can I do?.Always has a replay,   'N' never tilts at all   That deaf dumb and blind kid   Sure plays a mean pin ball..The darkness bleeds violent sights   It purges from within   Death, it holds you in its arms   And kisses you goodnight      Oh, oh, oh, the darkness comes   Oh, oh, oh, I feel its bite   Oh, it purges from within      It's over, it's over   This haunting, it's over   They cut my wrists, and watch me bleed   Inside a dream      It's over, it's over   This haunting, it's over   They cut my wrists and watch me bleed   They stop haunting me      The darkness bleeds violent sights   It purges from within   Death, it holds you in its arms   And kisses you goodnight      Oh, oh, oh, the darkness comes   Oh, oh, oh, I feel its bite   Oh, it purges from within      It's over, it's over   This haunting, it's over   They cut my wrists, and watch me bleed   Inside a dream      It's over, it's over   This haunting, it's over   They cut my wrists and watch me bleed   They stop haunting me.So it's over to you now   So it's over to you now (now, now, yeah)   And it's over to you now   Can't you see what I'm thinking-king-king?.I'm heading way down South where I can be free   I'm heading Mexico way, no hangman's about to put a leash around me"

"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"", builders of the Empire State Building face obstacles in attempting to allow dirigible's to dock there. The main obstacle was the lack of a suitable landing area. Dirigibles need a large area to land. Al Smith said to add a mooring mast to the top of the building and that would allowed a dirigible to land for several hours. During the time of land the dirigible may get ""refueling or service, and to let passengers on and off."" Passengers could get off and on the dirigible safely by walking down a gangplank to the open platform. Architects had trouble putting a mooring mast on the top of the Empire State Building's flat roof because they were afraid that the load of the dirigible and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted. Dirigibles had trouble with saftly, most of dirigibles use hydroge instead of helium, but hydrogen was highly flammable. The greatest obstacle of mooring mast was nature itself, wind were high due to violent air currents, and it would not be safe for dirigibles. The practical reason why dirigibles weren't allow to moor at @ORGANIZATION2 was law agaist airship flying too low. The idea of dirigible was given away to airplanes. The obstacles the builders of @ORGANIZATION3 faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there was solved..Oh home, Lord Lord Lord,   I will pawn my watch and chain and go home..Well I met a man in Montgomery Alabama   I was waitin' on a bus and he was shinin' shoes and I heard him say   I'm a shoeshine man number one in the land   A shoeshine man make you shine where you stand      Leave me a tip if you can I'm a shoeshine man   Well I can sing I can dance I can play the harmonica too   I got a brand new thing on the South Side Montgomery Blues   You better stick around and watch me cause I'm an entertainin' fool      I'm a shoeshine man number one in the land...

"The obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building by attempting dirigibles to dock there were to many to predicte. The obstacles faced by dirigibles to dock there were because of many variables such as climite, Buildings and most of all the dirigibles them selfs.The climite as said in paragraph @NUM1 consisted with dangerouse and uncontraiable winds and the reason was because of the Empire State building itself. The urban areas around consited of sharp hull breaching spires and due to the winds it made a hull breach @NUM2 times more likely.Finaly there constrousion.

"In the the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in the attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. The architects had to acomidate a lot of thing to allow dirigibles to dock at The mooring mast. For example In @CAPS1 @NUM1 it says ""The steelframe of the Empire State Building would have to modify and strengthen to accommodate this new situation"". Also in @CAPS1 @NUM2 it says ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was natur itself. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"". These factores and many more where the reason the mooring mast was never poot to use do to the feer of safty and law..[Pre-Chorus]   And with the black banners raised,   As the crooked smiles fade..Bitch, who do you love?.I'll be there for you.[Originally by Ramones]      Lobotomy!.Tiddle-dee-dumb, tiddle-dee-dumb   Help Lord, won't You come?.Hey, sometimes in the middle of the day   I get lovin' you on my mind   But as soon as you get home   You read the paper   Ain't got the time      What you been doin'?.and that ain't cool   Huh hey hoe, I heard you shot your woman down   You shot her down now   Hey Joe, I heard you shot your lady down   You shot her down in the ground yeah!.I wanted so badly   Somebody other than me   Staring back at me   But you were gone      I wanted to see you walking backwards   And get the sensation of you coming home   I wanted to see you walking away from me   Without the sensation of you leaving me alone      Time and time again   Time and time again   Time and time again   I can't please myself      I wanted the ocean to cover over me   I wanna sink slowly without getting wet   Maybe someday, I won't be so lonely   And I'll walk on water every chance I get      Time and time again   Time and time again   Time and time again   I can't please myself      So when are you coming home   Sweet angel?.Backwoods killer from a river town   A mixed up kid that let his hair hang down   High school rebel, he's always been bad   And his poor old man's still wond'ring 'bout the lad   But he's gone, gone away to find his fortune."
"In the excerpt from ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, their were many obstacles the builders faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One reason was the safety. Paragraph @NUM1 from the excerpts explains that, ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" It shows us that if an accident was to happen on the mast above a densely populated area like downtown New York, then the accident could get ugly. Another reason why was nature itself. Paragraph @NUM2 explains that the, ""winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" This was another safety issue because the dirigibles would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street. A third obstacle was that there was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. As you can see those were some obstacles builders faced..Then you said hello..Are they drunk down below?.Six o'clock, eight o'clock, nine o'clock, ten,   The neighbors all know that you're at it again..(Hook: Quavo)   Fucking wit the money pronto,   I need my cash on time pronto,   Tell the plug pull up pronto,   Asap, right now, Pronto,   Pronto (I need all my cash right now), Prontooo   I need my cash on time pronto,   Tell the plug pull up pronto, pronto   Right now, asap, Pronto,   Pronto (I need all my cash right now), Prontooo      [Verse 2: Offset)   Started from a brick now I'm in a condo,   Happened so fast, asap, Pronto,   Ain't really worried bout shit nomo,   Running to the money like Usain Bolt,   Sipping on the lean, Now I'm in slow mo,   Meeting wit the plug just to get the pesos,   Can't even wait, gotta go in get the the cake,   Cuz momma told me to put the food on the plate,   No delay, I need it undelay,   Gone just pay for the goons start to spray,   I ain't really trying take the shit that far,   Smoking on the gas that nigga on Mars,   Hurricane wrist got a nigga sea sick,   Paid in Full but my name ain't Mich,   And the trap got gat, and the trap got brick, asap, Pronto, Man a nigga got rich..And what was in those ships all three   On Christmas Day in the morning?.It is the only album it has been released on..""I love to dance""   And I told him, ""They don't take chances   They seem so removed from romance""   ""They've been broken in churches and schools   And molded to middle class circumstance""   And we were rolling, rolling, rock n' rolling      Downtown   The dance halls and cafes   Feel so wild you could break somebody's heart   Just doing the latest dance craze   Gail and Louise   In those push-up brassieres   Tight dresses and rhinestone rings   Drinking up the band's beers   Young love was kissing under bridges   Kissing in cars, kissing in cafes   And we were walking down Main Street   Kisses like bright flags hung on holidays   ""In France they kiss on Main Street""   ""Amour, mama, not cheap display""   And we were rolling, rolling, rock n' rolling      Downtown   In the pinball arcade   With his head full of pool hall pitches   And songs from the hit parade   He'd be singing ""Bye, Bye, Love""   While he's racking up his free play   Let those rock 'n roll choir boys   Come and carry us away   Sometimes Chickie had the car   Or Ron had a car   Or Lead Foot Melvin with his hot-wire head   We'd all go looking for a party   Looking to raise Jesus up from the dead   And I'd be kissing in the back seat   Thrilling to the Brando-like things that he said   And we'd be rolling, rolling, rock n' rolling.I have to sit down for   Ok, we'll, we'll do that for you, just a minute, thank you   There's a young man here at, at uh San Quentin   Tonight that wrote a song that I just   Saw written down on paper for the first time yesterday   He sent me the sheet music on it,   And I don't know anyone that reads music   Except, maybe Helen   And um, I liked the lyrics so much I started singing my own tune to it, you know   The first thing that come to my mind   Hey, lemme see that, let's just try a little bit of it right here      I don't know where I'm bound   I don't know where I'm bound   Whistles calling me away   Leaving at the break of day and   And I don't know where I'm bound      Can't stand locks, bars or doors   Mean cops insanity and wars   Gotta find a place of peace   Till then much travelin' won't cease   But I don't know where I'm bound      There's gotta be a place for me   Under some green growing tree   Clear cool water running by   An unfettered view of the sky   But I don't know where I'm bound      When I die don't bury me   Cause then I must be free   Cremate my body with a grin   Throw my ashes to the wind   Cause I don't know where I'm bound      I don't know where I'm bound   I don't know where I'm bound   Whistles calling me away   Leaving at the break of day   And I don't know where I'm bound      Got myself a little gal   She has been a damn right pall   That ol' highway's calling me   And free I gotta be but   I don't know where I'm bound   I don't know where I'm bound   I don't know where I'm bound      Thank you very much.Upon return, I conjure what was seen."
"The builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock their. An obstacle dealt with if the dirigibles were fit to dock in the Empire State Building. Another obstacle dealt with the mast. These obstacles made this construction a failure such as the author who says, ""The mooring mast of the Empire State Building was destined to never fulfill its purpose, for reasons that should have been apparent before it was ever constructed"" in @CAPS1 thirteen.First of, @CAPS1 five states the dirigibles were actually enormous steel-framed balloons, with envelopes of cotton fabric filled with hydrogen and helium to make some lighter in the air."" @CAPS1 six states that, ""Some were as long as one thousand feet."" @CAPS2 how may a blimp of that size ever managed to land on the Empire State Building. Also @CAPS1 nine says ""A thousand foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame."" This @CAPS1 also states that ""The stress the dirigibles load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below.""These were just a few of the obstacles the builders had to face. The fate of the mast such as in @CAPS1 @NUM1 says ""was neither practical nor safe."" The architects were blind to the potential problems of the mast. In the end the mast was a great attempt, but indeed a failure..Let your left foot lead you,   Let your right head speak to you,   Let your left hand meet you,   Let your right woman kick you..It's amazing   I'm the reason   Everybody fired up this evening      I'm exhausted   Barely breathing   Holding on to what I believe in      No matter what   You'll never take that from me   My reign is as far as your eyes can see      [Chorus]   It's amazin', so amazin', so amazin', so amazin', it's amazin'   So amazin', so amazin', so amazin', it's amazin' (Let's go)      I'm a monster   I'm a killer   I know I'm wrong, yeah      I'm a problem   That'll never   Ever be solved      And no matter what   You'll never take that from me   My reign is as far as your eyes can see      [Chorus]      I'm a monster   I'm a maven   I know this world is changin'      Never gave in   Never gave up   I'm the only thing I'm afraid of      No matter what   You'll never take that from me   My reign is as far as your eyes can see      [Chorus]      So amazin', so amazin', so amazin', it's amazin'   So amazin', so amazin', so amazin', it's amazin'      I'm amazin'   Yeah I'm all that   If i ain't on my grind   Then what you call that?.The sun disappears bringing fears that come only at night   With hopes and dreams that will wither away in the light   And thoughts wander back to the girl with the perfect smile   Who said she would never leave you alone   But she had to spend some time on her own for a while   There's more than one nightmare at large in this city tonight   You know you can't shut out the dark with the neon light   Deep in the town the night birds are walking   And somewhere a heart is being broken   One lonely soul finds a bar that stays open all night   It's alright until the night when you can't forget she went away   It's alright until the night when you can't forget she went away   A song drifts along from a bar where a jukebox plays   And triggers the memory of happier summer days   Drive to the beach, sun on the water   Love was in reach and you never saw that   The sun was sinking and love was fading away.Thoughts keep turning round in my mind   Now I see reason and rhyme..""no, don't....""

"The architect of the new building had three large problems with allowing dirigibles to moor at the top. The first problem was the harsh wind that high up made it extremely difficult to dock the dirigible, ""Fearing that the wind would blow the Dirigible onto the sharp spires of other buildings in the area, which would puncture the dirigible's shell, the captain could not even take his hands off the levers"". Second The back of the dirigible would not be tied down. This problem would lead to safety hazards with people getting off of it, ""The winds on the top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" This effect would also make a challenging and dangerous to take off. The last reason would be that it is illegal to fly aircraft sso low over the city already eliminating the possibility of allowing dirigibles to moor on top. Overall, this idea was not thought out well and was hurried so it would be the first building in the world to have a dirigible mooring mast.I thought You knew, guess I assumed to much   I don't know how, but now where so far out of touch   And I never planned, to so miss understand   But what you needed, you never asked me to give   And I swear as I live      I thought you knew my heart was yours   And that we were so together   That we, would always be   I don't believe, you leavin' me is the answer      I'm not askin' you to let me rush back in and fail again   I'm askin' for one chance, not to assume   So I can say and do all the things I thought you knew      So far where still so far   From where we know we should be   I'm searching for words   And you haven't heard      I thought you knew my heart was yours   And that we were so together   That we, would always be   I don't believe, you leavin' me is the answer      I'm not askin' you to let me rush back in and fail again   I'm askin' for one chance, not to assume   So I can say and do all the things I thought you knew      I thought you knew      Oh god I thought you knew!.It's music to my ears, Oh man!.Five minutes in the closet with you..Fate should have made you a gentleman's wife..Yeah   Yeah      If I knew what I wish I knew   I could've seen what I'm going through   When I first laid eyes on you   You blew me away, yeah yeah      If the timing's oh so right   I'd fear for you every night   It blew me away, yeah yeah      Innocence seems to fade away   Disappear, poof you're gone   Thought I'd lost the key to you   Looking for notes in the song      [Chorus]   This time we got it   Yeah, what I've been looking for   Reached out and got it   I shouldn't ask for anymore   If you could ask for anything more   You could be king for a day   You could be queen for a day   'Bout time you got it   (This time we got it)   This time we got it   Let's take it away      Now I tried for something new   Wasn't rich enough to pay my dues   Was I in the right direction?.I see the snowflakes falling   I hear the drumbeat calling   I am just only lonely Indian girl   Braver than all the brave now   I sit at every pow-wow   I fought a million men for Indian girl      Ten hides and twenty horses   That's what the tribal law says   Too much for me to pay for Indian girl      Oh sun shine on sun shine on   And take my darkness away   Oh sun shine on sun shine on   And bring this girl my way      Far from her lonely teepee   Wind sends her sweetness to me   Too much for me to bear my Indian girl   Gather your things together   And bring your wedding feather   We'll steal away forever Indian girl      Chorus x2.You've left me blind in paradise..We slip, we fumble, and we all fall down   Hearts to mend, sun comes up again..Won't anybody help us, what're we waitin' for?"

Even if there wasn't a law making it ""illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area"" (@NUM4) the attemption of even trying would be very dangerous to the people around and below it, and the building itself..Let our friends say what they want to say   If I'm wrong I'll be the one to pay   No matter if it's true   You'll find that I'm all for you      Let the cards predict we'll drift apart   And the stars forfeit of broken heart   No matter it they do   You'll find that I'm all for you      I only know come what may   You'll always find me by your side   I may be a fool   Time alone will decide      Let them all say that it's just a game   And I'm sure to lose   But just the same no matter if I do   You'll find that I'm all for you.No pain   Inside   You're my protection   But how do I feel this good sober?.Listen girl   Just let me talk to you   I just wanna be with you   So why should I play it cool   You and me, We got a chemistry   So I don't need poetry to say what ya mean to me      See I'm not into buying your affections   With a diamond on a necklace   Theres a realer way to do it girl   I don't need to throw you all these lines   Just so you know I know your fine I'm gonna come right out and say it girl      [Chorus]   I love you, I love you   Whats wrong with saying it the easy way   I love you, I love you   Whats wrong with saying it the easy way      Pretty girl I don't wanna play no more   Been there done that before   I've never been so sure   About what I feel   Lets get it on for real   Why should I hold it back   When all I wanna say is that      See I'm not into buying your affections   With a diamond on a necklace   Theres a realer way to do it girl   I spend all the time I have with you   I never treat you bad   Ain't that enough to show you   That you are my world      [Chorus]      Oh I love you, I love you the easy way   I Love you...

" Acording to the @CAPS1 both the @CAPS2 and the architects came across several obsticles when it came too building an Area Where Blimps could land that made this @CAPS3 unfesable. One of the @CAPS4 Reasons that this @CAPS3 @CAPS5 was due to the Air laws that made it illegal to fly too low in urban Areas. An additional conflict was fact was that @CAPS6 winds could push the tale of the blimp into sharp spires of neighboring buildings that would pop the dirigible as if it where a balloon..Brian: We did that..Time flies but you're the pilot   It moves real fast but you're the driver   You may crash and burn sometimes      [Chorus]   This is why we do it   This is worth the pain   This is why we fall down   To get back up again   This is where the heart lies   This is from above   Love is this, this is love   Love is why we do it   Love is worth the pain   Love is why we fall down   To get back up again   Love is where the heart lies   Love is from above   Love is this, this is love.Of the darkness in men's minds   What can you say   That wasn't marked by history   Or the T.V..Oh spare the spud!.In my hour of need   Ha, you're not there   And though I reach out for you   Wouldn't lend a hand   Through the darkest hour   Grace did not shine on me   It feels so cold, very cold   No one cares for me   Did you ever think I get lonely?.Bloaw!.On the fifth day of Christmas,   My true love sent to me   Five golden rings,   Four calling birds,   Three French hens,   Two turtle doves,   And a partridge in a pear tree..Falling apart,   I can survive,   With you by my side..We'll sing our old Alma Mater   And think of things that used to be      I remember it so well   Back when the weather was cool   We used to have so much fun   When we were walking to school   If we stopped off to hear   The latest songs they sing   And we just make it in   Before the bells would ring      Oh baby doll!"
"Based on the excerpt, builders faced many problems in allowing dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building. First, safety would be a large problem. Back then, most dirigibles used hydrogen (which is highly flammable) instead of helium to power them. This means that if there was a malfunction such as a fire, not only with the dirigible burst into flames, but the Empire State Building could too. Another obstacle builders had to confront was mother nature. According to paragraph @NUM1 of the reading, the location of the Empire State building has ""violent air currents"" with shifting winds. This problem would cause the dirigible to not stay stable. Although solutions like lead weights being hung from the back of the dirigible were offered, this only lead to more problems. If the lead weight fell, where would it land? The answer would be in the streets of @ORGANIZATION2 where pedestrians could be harmed. The final obstacle builders would have had to get through if they continued their plans for the dirigibles would be a law. The law stated (according to the reading) that airships could not fly too low over urban areas. So in theory, all of the plans the builders of this concoction had to be put to rest due to the governments law. In conclusion, many problems arose as building, and plans to make the ""Dirigible dock"" were made..And if your love was not a game, I only have myself to blame..What can I do, what can I say   Running down this suspicious highway   I can't forget how love let me down   And when we meet it still gets in my way..Hey!.

"Throughout the process of building the Empire State Building with dirigibles dock there were many complications. At @CAPS1 the building was unable to simply put a mooring mast on top of the building. The roof was flat, therefore the dirigible would add stress to the building. They would need over @MONEY1 to modify the building framework. Then they realized that most dirigibles used hydrogen rather than helium, hydrogen is highly flammable which would be unsafe. They ran into a problem with nature itself. At the top of the Empire State Building the winds constantly shifted because of the violent air currents. Even if they were to tether the mooring mast, the back of the ship would spin around and around the mooring mast. Therefore with people all over the streets in @CAPS2 this was neither possibly or safe. There was also an exisisting law against flying airships too low over urban areas. All this gave way to airplanes, so even though dirigibles didn't work it helped..Tell me, tell me yeah   Don't tease me..Lying in my bed I hear the clock tick,   And I think of you   Caught up in circles confusion   Is nothing new      Flashback warm nights   Almost left behind   Suitcases of memories,   Time after      Sometimes you picture me   And I'm walking too far ahead   You're calling to me, and I can't hear   What you've said      Then you say go slow   I fall behind   The second hand unwinds   If you're lost you can look and you will find me      Time after time   If you fall I will catch you I'll be waiting   Time after time   If you're lost you can look and you will find me      Time after time   If you fall I will catch you I'll be waiting   Time after time   After my picture fades and darkness has      Turned to gray   Watching through windows you're wondering   If I'm OK   Secrets stolen from deep inside      The drum beats out of time   If you're lost you can look and you will find me   Time after time   If you fall I will catch you I'll be waiting      Time after time   You said go slow   I fall behind   The second hand unwinds      If you're lost you can look and you will find me   Time after time   If you fall I will catch you I'll be waiting   Time after time      If you're lost you can look and you will find me   Time after time   If you fall I will catch you I'll be waiting      Time after time   Time after time   Time after time   Time after time.You can't begin to feel, can't begin to feel, can't begin to feel..All night long!.Punjab: We got Annie!.Damn... we was spose to rule the world baby   We was unstoppable!.Just another woman   In my life   Just another woman   Lost in the night   Just another woman   Keepin' in touch with a man      Knock upon my window   Late at night making me believe   that something's not right   I look through the window but all I can see   Is the rain   Standing on my doorstep   Not very old looking so helpless   And looking so cold   A woman in need of some help   Most have lost her way      She was tall   She was lost   She could smile   And her words got crossed      Just another woman   In my life   Just another woman   Lost in the night   Just another woman   Keepin' in touch with a man      As we sat by the fire   The flame just grew   Talking about just the things we knew   Watching a new day arise outside my room   The more I listened the more she told   And in fascination my heart was sold   Weaving in and out of my mind   With a skidder off now      She was tall   She was lost   She could smile   And her words got crossed      Just another woman   In my life   Just another woman   Lost in the night   Just another woman   Keepin' in touch with a man.Burn in a gasoline dream, burn away my love..I've pulled down my lace and the chintz."
"The builders of the Empire State building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle was that countries other than the United States used hydrogen rather than helium. Hydrogen is highly flamable, if it caught fire above a city, the results would be diasastrous. Another obstacle was that at such a hieght,  the winds would blow the back of the dirigible around. Perhaps the most obvious obstacle in allowing dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building was the law that airships could not fly below a certain hieght over cities. All of these obstacles combined to make the project impractical and impossible.Overwhelming as they are   Breeding hope by counting stars   Merge the bitterness the pain   Which I'm sure   You can explain again      One gets hurt when she feels small   (And she's longing for some peace )   Being the center of it all   (Slow attack but fast release )   Hear the difference in vain   Out of tune but just not quite the same      Overwhelming as they are   (With their mystifying glow )   Breeding hope by counting stars   (As they hunger for the show )   Hear the difference in vain   Out of tune but just not quite the same.Ohh   All the plans we made don't work if you're not around   So tell me, what am I gonna do with forever now?.Lonely days go on and on forever   Like the memories of you in my mind   No, I can't forget you now   It's impossible   'Cause I'll miss you more than now tomorrow      Ooh   Will these lonely days   Will these lonely days   Will these lonely days ever end?.Do you have the time to listen to me whine   About nothing and everything all at once   I am one of those   Melodramatic fools   Neurotic to the bone   No doubt about it      Sometimes I give myself the creeps   Sometimes my mind plays tricks on me   It all keeps adding up   I think I'm cracking up   Am I just paranoid?.The things I can do I've been thinking of   That I should have done alone   Yet all these things I've been thinking of   Are no good to do alone..I twirl through the driveway with angelic grace 'til I slip on the sidewalk and fall on my face,   This peppermint winter is so sugar-sweet,   I don't need to taste to believe,   What's December without Christmas Eve?.Right here, right now, let's have a party,   We'll never stop, so won't you get me      Give me some more,   I need it right now, get it now,   Give me some more,   I need it one more time      Give me some more,   I want it right now, get it now,   Give me some more,   I want it one more time      I never wanted to be more than who I am,   I'm just a lucky son from an unlucky man,   You'd get me more than anything I ever had      Take away my faith,   Take away my name,   Give me one more, one more pain      [Guitar Solo]      Give me some more,   I need it right now, get it now,   Give me some more,   I need it one more time      Give me some more,   I want it right now, get it now,   Give me some more,   I want it one more time      Give me some more,   I need it right now, get it now,   Give me some more,   I need it one more time      Give me some more,   I want it right now, get it now,   Give me some more,   I want it one more time.Cheers!.But I've got to set you free."
"The builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous obstacles in attempting to allow  dirigibles to dock there. The unforeseen safety issues lead to the downfall of the creative use for the building. ""The greatest reason was one of safety. Most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable"" (@CAPS1). They saw some of the dangerous affect of hydrogen when the German dirigible the Hindenburg was destroyed in a fire. ""Owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse the accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York"" (@CAPS1). Other problems that the builders of the building faced were those of mother nature. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"" (@CAPS1). This made it hard for the dirigible to dock to the mast safely. ""Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast"" (@CAPS1). Not only was nature playing against the builders, but the law was also. This is almost negligence on the builders part to not realize that they would be breaking a law by constructing this mooring mast. ""This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area"" (@CAPS1). Although the idea for a dirigible mooring mast on top of the empire State building seemed innovative and practical, it was irrelevant due to the many obstacles that obstructed the builders of the Empire State Building..I was like a rolling stone      Walking alone, a street with no phone   Could I be younger most of the time?.For the rest of your days I'll be the road that takes you home..One two, one two three four   ...are wondering about   It's a hit!.For ever and ever babe   Is that when it stays for you and me?.You've been dreaming   If you're thinking   That I still belong to you   I've been dying,   'Cause I'm lying to myself      Say it's over   Yes it's over   But I need you anyway   Say you love me but it's not enough.I do not care..Seen all good things and bad   Running down the hill   All so   Battered and   Brought to the ground   I am hungry again   I am drunk again   With all the money I owe to my friends      When I'm like this how can you be smiling   Saying   How can you be sure?.Give me these moments back..The yellow raven sipped the air   Of thunder and of rain   The yellow raven sipped the air   Gentle eyes kissing the rain      Where do you go, fantastic dream bird?"
"By attempting to construct a mast on the Empire State Building, builders encountered all sorts of problems. The purpose of this mast was to allow dirigibles, or blimps, to dock. Many of these problems however, were the effect of the dirigible itself. In paragraph thirteen, line @NUM1, the author talks about some of the dangers of the dirigible, ""Most dirigibles... used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" Another obstacle is location. It was thought to be very unsafe because if a blimp caught fire it would land in the middle of New York City, not some remote cornfield And finally, the winds changed frequently that high up. It was an unwise decision to dock at this area if the dirigible would be blown around the building..Where your heart wants to play   And your feet want to dance,   Where the close of each day   Brings a night of romance..Yeah!.Move why'self to go again   Cold water in the face   Brings you back to this awful place   Knuckle merchants and you bankers, too   Must get up an' learn those rules   Weather man and the crazy chief   One says sun and one says sleet   A.M., the F.M..If I am dead, why am I dreaming?.We will be the forgotten ones   They will shake their heads and pity us   We who sacrificed our sons and daughters   With the sweet taste of victory on our lips   They will cry, but their tears will come too late   There is no redemption for the ones   Who choose to walk in the shadows      Oh sweet redeemer will you save a place for me   I am tired and I'm seeking restitution   Oh will you heal me, will you take away my pain   What I'm looking for is absolution   Getting out of Purgatory   Is no small accomplishment   And the price is high   And it comes with its own set of conditions   The choice is never clear and difficult to make   But it will not change them   They will just go on the way they always have      Oh sweet redeemer will you save a place for me   I am tired and I'm seeking restitution   Oh will you heal me, will you take away my pain   What I'm looking for is absolution.Sometimes it's a whisper,   Oh, sometimes it's a storm,   Sometimes it reaches forever   With it's everlasting arms..Down by the bay..Shout it loud from the rooftop high   Let it burn inside   And try only to fade and die      If I knew all there was to learn   Every twist and turn   Why do I still try?.Kid Rock Yeahhhhh      'Cause I'm a bad mama jamma from Detroit city   Rock from southern Alabama back to Macanow city   I'm raw and greedy, show me, gimme, I'll nick it   Gimme a slimmy and a jimmy I'll stick it      Pick me up lady or beam me up scottie   Late night shaddy let me slip it in your body   I'ma scramblin' ramblin' straight travelin' man   Spreadin' Moejo Sam, please understand      From Detroit to New Orleans   I love the life but I never sold my soul   All them late nights, and early mornings   Let me show you what I learned out on the road   Let me show you what I learned out on the road      You know I've tried a thousand times and I've tried to explain   And I've cried a thousand times over things that I can't change   I've learned a lot you know, I grow each passing day   And I blame nobody but myself for mistakes that I have made      He's a bad maama jamma from Detroit city   Rock from southern Alabama back to Macanow city   I'm raw and greedy, show me gimme, I'll nick it   Gimme a slimmy and a jimmy I'll stick it      Pick me up lady or beam me up scottie   Late night shaddy let me slip it in your body   I'ma scramblin' ramblin' straight travelin' man   Spreadin' Moejo Sam, please understand      From Detroit to New Orleans   I love the life but I never sold my soul   All them late nights, and early mornings   Let me show you what I learned out on the road   Let me show you what I learned out on the road      Lord knows when your not here, I get so damn bored of me   And I've spent some lonely nights that did not have to be   And if you could only see, I swear I'd show you true   And although I carry a load out on the road,   I want to come back home to you      From Detroit to New Orleans   I love the life but I never sold my soul   All them late nights, and early mornings   Let me show you what I learned out on the road      From Detroit to Carolina   I love the life but I never sold my soul   From London town down to China   Let me show you what I learned out on the road   Let me show you what I learned out on the road"
"Dirigibles, or blimps, were seen as the transportation of the future. In order to add height and yet serve a purpose, architects of the Empire state Building decided to build a mooring mast upon the building to accommodate ""aviation pioneers."" @CAPS1 the mast was built and gave the building its desired height, the usage of it as a docking station for dirigibles would never be fulfilled. The obstacles that builders had in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock included the height of the building, wind speeds, and the safety of civilians. The height of the building was 1,250 feet, thus having violent shifts in air currents. ""The wind s on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigibles were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" Dirigibles also used hydrogen for fuel and lead weights to be weighed down; however, by using the mast, hydrogen and the use of lead weights provided a safety hazard to civilians below. Builders had created the mooring mast to dock dirigibles, but the idea caused problems and was never fulfilled..Hush now, my baby   Be still love, don't cry..Because You're mine the brightest star I see   Looks down my love and envies me   Because you're mine   Because you're mine      Because you're mine the breeze that hurries by   Becomes a melody and why   Because you're mine   Because you're mine      I only know for as long as I may live   I'll only live for the kiss that you alone may   give me   And when we kiss   That isn't thunder dear   It's only my poor heart you hear   And it's applause   Because you're mine      And when we kiss   That isn't thunder dear   It's only my poor heart you hear   And it's applause   Because you're mine.How can I love you?.Don't ever let it end..And likewise there is no moon..Don't count the waves,   Don't count the waves..He's a wise guy, when guy   Don't like my eye spy   Always a snipe try   Never a green guy   Loathed by everyone   But loved by his mother      Give you a calls   For the   Thing upstairs   She brings him his night time brown and flask   Sews up his nighttime brown and mask   You bleed in my eye   You bleed in my eye   White track      Grass sliding, slasher   Brain dead fucker   Rips of himself and steals from his brother   Loathed by everyone   But loved by his mother      (kiss kiss)      Why then should you do it again and again and again..[Chorus]   Its not that I don't wanna love you   Its not that I'm really over it, you know (you know)   Its just that I can't watch us bleed to death   When we used to be   Brooklyn Nights happy..The more that I've tried   The more that you've pried   Yourself away..."
"In ""The Mooring Mast"", by @ORGANIZATION2 it revealed many problems with docking dirigibles on top of the Empire State Building. Al Smith, the Architect working on the Empire State Building thought the mooring mast would go up with no problems. Architects soon realized that the mooring mast would add stress to the buildings frame work and cost @MONEY1 in modifications. After seeing what happened to the German dirigible ""Hindenburg"" in Lakehurst, Architects soon realized that having dirigibles filled with highly-flamable hydrogen over the densely populated New York City wasn't a good idea. Nature itself would not allow the mooring mass to be built.There was such violent air currents at the one thousand and fifty foot tall @ORGANIZATION1 altitude that made Architects aware that this idea couldn't be upheld. The dirigible would swivel around because it couldn't be weighed down like in open landing fields. They couldnt use these weights because having weights suspended over pedestrians heads was neither practical nor safe. There is also a law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This would make it illegal to try and dock a dirigible on top of the Empire State Building. In the end, the idea of having dirigibles dock on the Empire State Building and become the new way of modern transportation was soon abolished..Well if you've been a married woman   And things didn't seem to work out   Divorce is the key to bein' loose and free   So you're gonna be talked about      Everybody knows that you've loved once   They think you'll love again   You can't have a male friend   When you're a has been of a woman you're rated X      And if you're rated X   You're some kind of goal   Every man might try to make   But I think it's wrong   To judge every picture if a cheap camera makes a mistake      And when your best friend's husband says to you   You've sure started lookin' good   You should've known he would   And he would if he could and he will if you're rated X      Well nobody knows where you're goin'   But they sure know where you've been   All their thinkin' of is your experience of love   Their minds eat up with sin      The women all look at you like you're bad   And the men all hope you are   But if you go too far you're gonna wear the scar   Of a woman rated X   And if you're rated X   You're some kind of goal   Every man might try to make   But I think it's wrong   To judge every picture if a cheap camera makes a mistake      And when your best friend's husband says to you   You've sure started lookin' good   You should've known he would   And he would if he could and he will if you're rated X.Sha, sha, sha      I probably shouldn't say this   But at times I get so scared   When I think about the previous   Relationship we shared   It was awesome, but we lost it   It's not possible for me not to care   And now we're standing in the rain   But nothing's ever gonna change until you hear   My dear      The seven things I hate about you   The seven things I hate about you   Oh, you   You're vain, your games, you're insecure   You love me, you like her   You made me laugh, you made me cry, I don't know which side to buy   Your friends, they're jerks, and when you act like them, just know it hurts   I wanna be with the one I know   And the seventh thing I hate the most that you do   You make me love you      It's awkward and it's silent   As I wait for you to say   But what I need to hear now your sincere apology   When you mean it, I'll believe it If you text it I'll delete it   Let's be clear   Oh, I'm not coming back   You're taking seven steps here      The seven things I hate about you   You're vain, your games, you're insecure   You love me, you like her   You made me laugh, you made me cry, I don't know which side to buy   Your friends, they're jerks, and when you act like them, just know it hurts   I wanna be with the one I know   And the seventh thing I hate the most that you do   You make me love you      Compared to all the great things   That would take too long to write   I probably should mention   The seven that I like      The seven things I like about you   Your hair, your eyes, your old Levi's   When we kiss, I'm hypnotized   You made me laugh, you made me cry, but I guess that's both that I'll have to buy   Your hand in mine when we're intertwined, everything's alright   I wanna be with the one I know   And the seventh thing I like the most that you do   You make me love you      Sha, sha, you do, oh.Have you ever thought about your soul - can it be saved?.I need you near to me   More than anyone could ever know..Damnit we just cause   Seems this lovin's   All for nothing   Baby, you know      [Chorus]   A heart ain't a brain   But I think   That I still love you   A happy endin'   Makes it right   Cause it ends   When you don't want to   And it makes perfect sense   To end it like the start   How do I explain   This nonsense to my heart?.North and South, their both the best..Help me, oh help me, please help me my Jesus..I'm off again in my World      I never spend less than an hour,   Washin' my hair in the shower,   It always takes 5 hours to make it straight,   So I'll braid it in a zillion braids,   Though it may take all friggen day,   There's nothin' else better to do anyway..Ignited by a spark."
" the obstacles the builder of the empire state Building faced were... When the were planning to build a mask for the Dirigibles. When they first tried to build it they figured out that the structure of the Empire State building could not hold the mask. The Empire State building had to souport both the mask and the Dirigibles. Then at the end of the story the figured out there was no way to do it. That was one of the obsticals..I love you..Who's the mack?.Give me an old fashioned Christmas, an old fashioned Christmas   Family faces, wide open spaces, covered with snow   Right now my mom there in the kitchen, basting the Christmas bird   You'll have to take my word, you can't find that at the automat   An old fashioned fireplace, give me an old fashioned fireplace   My heart remembers smoldering embers, warming your glow   I'd trade that whole Manhattan skyline, the shimmering steel and chrome   For one old fashioned Christmas back home.There's a way to live that's right for us   Like Mayans in Manhattan and Los Angeles   I'm scaling up, I'm breaking down   And I'm doing lunch all over town      Networking, I'm user friendly   Networking, I install with ease   Data processed, truly Basic   I will upload you, you can download me      There's a long, hard road and a full hard drive   And a sector there where I feel alive   Every bit and every byte   Is written down once on the night      Networking, I'm user friendly   Networking, I install with ease   Data processed, truly Basic   I will upload you, you can download me      There's a prayer each night that I always pray   Let the data guide me through every day   And every pulse and every code   Deliver me from the bypass mode      Networking, I'm user friendly   Networking, I install with ease   Data processed, truly Basic   I will upload you, you can download me.When the snowman brings us snow   Well he just might like to know   He's put a great big smile, on someone elses face   If you jump into your bed   Quickly cover up your head   Don't you lock the doors   You know that sweet Santa Claus in on the way      Well I wish it could be Christmas, every day   When the kids start singing and the band begins to play   Oh, I wish it could be Christmas, every day   Let the bells ring out for Christmas      When we're skating in the park   If the snow cloud makes it dark   Then your rosy cheek's gonna light my merry way   Now the frosty paws appear   And they've frozen up my beard   So we'll lie by the fire   'Til the heat simply melts 'em all away      Well I wish it could be Christmas, every day   When the kids start singing and the band begins to play   Oh, I wish it could be Christmas, every day   So let the bells ring out for Christmas      When the snowman brings the snow (when the snowman brings the snow)   Well he just might like to know (well he just might like to know)   He's put a great big smile on somebody's face   So if Santa brings that sleigh (Santa brings that sleigh)   All along the Milky Way (along the Milky Way)   I'll sign my name on the rroftop in the snow   Then he may decide to stay      Well I wish it could be Christmas, every day   When the kids start singing and the band begins to play   Oo-oh, I wish it could be Christmas, every day   So let the bells ring out for Christmas      Okay you lot -

"the obstacles the builders of the empire state @CAPS1 face. was that their expanded use in @LOCATION1 was the lack of a suitable landing erea. Al Smith saw an opportunity for his empire state Building.A mooring mast added to the top of the building would allow dirigibles to anchor there for several hours for refueling or service, and to let passangers off and on. Dirigibles were docked by means of an electric winch, which hauled in a line from the front of the ship and then tied it to a mast..It gets me through yeah....I'll be loving you eternally (eternally)   There'll be no one new, my dear, for me (eternally)   Though the sky should fall   Remember I shall always be   Forever true (true)   And loving you (you)   Eternally....Is this some kind of love   That only hate would understand?.Well, you ain't so big   You're just tall, that's all   Got me working, boss man   Working 'round the clock      I want me a drink of water   But you won't let Jimmy, stop      Big boss man   Can't you hear me when I call?.I'm gonna shout it every day   Gloria!.Petticoats rustle, working shoes scuffle,   Hustle on down to the bars..Life on the run has set me free, me free now..Plow in the world, but my hoe's still missin', my hoe's still missin', my hoe's still missin'..Doesn't it ever stay   Must it always fade away   Couldn't love ever be   Something tangible and real   Farewell, fair weather friend   Abandonment returns to taunt me again      I only wanted you to stay   Linger and mean the words you said   Foolishly I romanticized   Someone was saving my life   For the first time   I only wanted you to be there when I   Opened up my eyes      I was caught in your masquerade   Wish I'd stayed beneath my veil   But it just seemed so easy to   Open up myself to you   Once more into the wind   The embers scatter   And the chill settles in      I only wanted you to stay   Linger and mean the words you said   Foolishly I romanticized   Someone was saving my life   For the first time   I only wanted you to be there when I   Opened up my eyes      Oh   I only wanted you to stay   Linger and mean the words you said   Foolishly I romanticized   Someone was saving my life   For the first time   I only wanted you to be   The one to get me through that night      I only wanted you   To be there when I   Opened up my eyes   Oh   Doesn't it ever stay?"
"In the process of building the dock for dirigibles, builders faced some obstacles. The first obstacle builders faced, was the lack of suitable landing area. If there wasn't area to land, there was no reason or way to build it. Also, the builders would have to remodel the whole building. After the building was framed to the 85th floor, they couldn't build the mast until the roof was done, so it took even longer.The greatest obstacle the mast dealt with was nature itself, because the winds on the tops of the buildings were constantly shifting, so there was no way for a dirigible to land or stay in place without crashing. The final obstacle builders faced was a law against airships flying too low to the urban areas, which made it illegal for a ship to ever tie up or even approach the building.As you can see, there were many obstacles, and the mast wasn't useful. It was a great idea. But in my opinion it was a waste of time and money..I have an ear for mu-Sic, and I have an eye for A maid..Now you're talking in headlines   Up to the minute and free   Stop press, hold the front page   Up as a mirror   Are you reading me?.So, let me hold you tight   And wile away this winter night..Hopelessly drifting,   Bathing in beautiful agony..Why'd'ya have to leave me there   Hanging in my infant air   Waiting?.I'm sittin' in a magic hat   With smoke and mirrors   And tire rubber fires   Watch me disappear   What made it slow you down   Sucking on a ball and chain   Another motherfucker goes down the drain   Hard headed fuck you all   Just add it up to the hot rod death toll      Sick in the head sick in the mouth   And I can't hear a word you say   Not a bit, and I don't give a shit   I got the glass, I got the steel   I got the love to hate   All I need is your head on a stake   Hard headed fuck you all   Just add it on the hot rod death toll.Walking, waiting alone without a care   Hoping and hating the things that I can't bear   Did you think it's cool to walk right up   To take my life and fuck it up?.Here I am   Just for You, only You   Here I stand   Wanting You, only You      In Your presence Lord   I will find my strength   You're the breath in me   You're my everything      With my heart bowed low   And my hands held high   All consuming fire   You're my one desire      You're name, oh You're name   Let it stay on my lips   I will seek Your face   God, it's You, only You      In Your presence Lord   I will find my strength   You're the breath in me   You're my everything      With my heart bowed low   And my hands held high   All consuming fire   You're my one desire      In Your presence Lord   I will find my strength   You're the breath in me   You're my everything      With my heart bowed low   And my hands held high   All consuming fire   You're my one desire      It's You, God   It's You   It's You, only You      My heart will always sing   I love You, I love You   My heart will always sing   I love You, I love You   My heart will always sing   I love You, I love You   My heart will always sing   I love You, I love You      In Your presence Lord   I will find my strength   You're the breath in me   You're my everything      With my heart bowed low   And my hands held high   All consuming fire   You're my one desire      In Your presence Lord   I will find my strength   You're the breath in me   You're my everything      With my heart bowed low   And my hands held high   All consuming fire   You're my one desire      It's You, God   It's You   It's You, only You      Lord, it's You, God   It's You   It's You, only You      Yeah, it is You      My heart will always sing   I love you, I love you   My heart will always sing   I love you, I love   My heart will always sing   I love you.There's a miracle waiting, there's a ticket worth taking   There's a reason to believe your eyes   An ounce of conviction is the only admission   Yeah, it's risky, but it's worth the ride   And all the dreams that you've held inside   Yes, they're waiting to break out, you just have to try      Make it shine, let your heart beat right in time   Make it shine, lay your whole world on the line      Find a clue and unfold it, shake the dust off and hold it   If it tells you something let me know   So much is forgotten, so much worth unlocking   Won't you tell me how to break the code   And never worry 'bout the things you read   It's so easy to tear down, so hard to believe      Too may dreamers are fading, shine on, shine on, shine      Live, there's a life to live   Give, there's a gift to give   Yes, there's a reason to make it   Shine on and make it true,   Work, make it work for you   Yes, there's a reason to make it shine      Find a secret and learn it, find a key there and turn it   Do whatever you do through the night   A skill in your fingers like a memory lingers   You gotta do it till it comes out right   You never know till you take a chance   If you're out on that wire you might as well dance"
" The builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle was safety because outside the U.S dirigibles were using hydrogen instead of helium which is highly flammable. The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting because of violent air currents. One more obstacle was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. The law said it was illegal for a ship to approach or even be tied up to a building..You don't know how beautiful you are      Sexy boots   I don't wanna talk about wars between the nations   Sexy Boots yeah!.Is it me now, is it him baby?.They put the finger on you,   Finger gang..I gave her money, said she knew someone..Age 39, looking over from my hotel window,   Trying to tackle away with heart of clay..Gants   Charme du ghetto, sur les photos   Joue les pachs, J'serre des tis-m?.It's like a normal Times Square day on 42nd Street   I feel like trashing some windows and crunching some feet   I watch society crumble and I just laugh (hee hee)   They soon will see what it's like to be the other half      But I'm trying   Said I'm trying to forget   And it ain't happened yet   I must of woke up this morning with a bug up my ass      I think I'll just haul off and belt the next jerk that I pass   My old man says I'm just a stoned little punk   But he keeps himself a pistol and he's always drunk   I know      Something's gonna give   Pretty soon   I know it   Something's gonna give      I want to live   I want to mess thing whole world around   Go on and poison all the water, use up all the air   Blow your stupid heads off, see if I could care      Put me down but don't blame me for what you did   'Cause inside everyone is a heavy metal kid   I was a sweet little kid once   Now I'm a full grown crank      And when I die I'll probably come back as a Sherman tank   I know that I could make this world so peaceful and calm   If I could only get my hands on a hydrogen bomb.She only loves in stereo!.Roll me over and turn me around, let me keep spinnin till I hit the ground."
"One of the obstacles they faced were the strong winds. Because of the violent air currents the winds were constantly shifting. The dirigible would constantly be moving around. They couldn't even weigh it down, because there would be people far below them, and they could fall. A second obstacle they faced were the laws against it. There were existing laws about airships flying too low over the city. It was illegal for the airships to even come into the city.           Those two obstacles stop them using the dock for dirigibles..Hate me,   I'll be the, I'll be the end that you deserve..I can tell by the look in your eye   You've never seen the man with nothing to say   I can tell by the look in your eye   You'd better watch yourself, St. George is on his way   I can tell by the look in your eye   You've never seen the man with nothing to say   I can tell by the look in your eye   You'd better watch yourself, St. George is on his way   I can tell by the, I can tell by the   I can tell by the, I can tell by the   I can tell by the, I can tell by the   I can tell by the look in your eye.When I was thirteen   I had my first love   There was nobody that compared to my baby   And nobody came to between us,   No-one could ever come above   She had me going crazy   Oh I star-struck   She woke me up daily   Don't need no Starbucks   She make my heart pound   I skip a beat when   I see her in the street and   At school on the playground   But I really wanna   See her on the weekend   She knows she got me dazing   Cuz she was so amazing   And now my heart is breaking   But I just keep on saying      (Justin)   Baby, baby, baby oooh   Like baby, baby, baby noo   Like baby, baby, baby oooh   I thought you'd always be mine      Baby, baby, baby oooh   Like baby, baby, baby noo   Like baby, baby, baby oooh   I thought you'd always be mine, mine      Baby, baby, baby oooh   Like baby, baby, baby noo   Like baby, baby, baby oooh   I thought you'd always be mine, mine      Yeah Yeah (5x)   Now I'm all gone, gone, gone, ooh   I'm gone, ooohh.I just can't get through you despite all the ways I try   Or any of the things I do maybe I'd better off talking to a wall   Cause you ain't making any sense at all I'm walking and I'm talking   And I'm trying and I'm lying but I just ain't getting through to you   Am I just wasting all my precious time cause I ain't wasting a breath   On you or any of your kind if you had any brains you would open   Your mind but I guess you're just afraid of what you gonna   Find it's a malfunction.Down town the young ones are growing..Perfect   Yeah   Said you can see the cracks in Mr..Not this stuff baby.Seen you before, I know your sort   You think the world awaits your every breath   You'll be my friend, or so you say   You'll help me out when the time comes      And all the time we're getting rich   You hang around to help me out      But when we're skint, oh God forbid!.They do it, they do it, they do it, they do it!"

"The builders of the Empire State building faced many obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. For example the building had to be reframed because its original frame could not support the weight of a dirigible on top it. Also the materials inside dirigibles are highly flammable so an accident above an urban area thats highly popuated would have been costly/fatal. Another obstacle was the wind, since the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents the dirigible would be swiveling around and unstable, thus making the idea for docking dirigibles on top of the empire state building unpractical and unsafe..I try to relax,   'Cause I must maintain my cool..Just because I ask a friend about him   Just because I spoke his name somewhere   Just because I saw him, then went all to pieces   He thinks I still care   He thinks I still care   He thinks I still care   He thinks I still care.She won't satisfy another man..Lick the alphabet, Chet..I think to much about you baby   You've on my mind more than you should   I would do without you now   I would walk away now if I could   I never needed anybody baby   I'm the one who never thought I would      I keep telling myself I don't need you   I keep telling myself I don't want you, now   I'd tell myself anything to make me believe   That I don't love you baby   But I can't lie to my heart      Something's got me running to you   Something tells me I can't run away   Even if I thought of leaving   The thought of you would only make me stay   No one's ever gotten to me baby   I'm the one who always got away      I can't tell the sky that it's not blue   How can I tell you that I don't love you?.You do this, and I oblige   And I fight..Hey, hey!.I believe in hope, I believe in dreams, I believe in luck, I believe in schemes   I believe in fate, I believe in time, I believe what I believe ain't worth a dime..I never felt like this with someone, I never knew I could feel this way at all   Predestination by appointment, storybook realities are coming true   I was scared, you look so helpless, the lust was dressed in good disguise      I took you on to meet my mother   Just like me, she fell straight in love with you   You took me to your own apartment, was it me or does the night do things to you   You read from Venus and Adonis, so honey how could I resist      C'mon baby we've got tonight, no one loses when two tigers fights   I lift you up, never let you down   I'll be the jester, babe, and you'll be the crown   We're instinctively impulsive, we're animals      A body like yours should be arrested, honey I should be locked up in a cage   We are flesh, we are carnal cut, oh we are human   Oh babe got these eyes we can't contend   Smoke alarm is going off again, I guess I'm gonna have to cool you down      Say come on baby, we've got tonight, no one loses when two tigers fight   You'll be fire, I'll be the ice, so come on baby melt me ooh so nice   Instinctively impulsive, we're animals      Some girls may turn me up, but only you, baby, turn me on   When we touch it's so explosive, it seems my life's been leading to this      Say come on baby, we've got tonight, no one loses when two tigers fight   You'll be fire, I'll be the ice, so come on baby melt me ooh so nice   Is it rhythm, is it magic, we're animals   Ooh baby, we're animals."
"Based on the excerpt to the dirigibles were not ever able to dock atop the Empire State building because @CAPS1 it was a question of safty. The passage reads that most dirigibles from outside the United States are fulled with hydrogen which is flamible. This caused the Hindenburg a German made vessel to burst into flames in New Jersey, and when this happened the owners of the empire state building realized how much worse the accident could have been if it had happend in the densly populated New York City. Also this was a question of safty because the winds on the top of the building would blow the dirigible all around. Lastly there is a law prohibiting the flight of airships in low urban aeras so the ships could not fly in New York City.Slipping into stockings,   Stepping into shoes,   Dipping in the pockets of her raincoat..Who's that lurking in the shadows?.Turn it inside out so I can see   The part of you that's driftin over me   'Cause when I look you're never there   But when I sleep you're everywhere   You're everywhere      Tell me how I got this far   Tell me why you're here and who you are   'Cause everytime I look   You're never there   And everytime I sleep   You're always there      'Cause you're everywhere to me   And when I close my eyes   It's you I see   You're everything I know   That makes me believe   I'm not alone      I recognized the way you make me feel   It's hard to think that you might not be real   I sense it now the water's getting deep   I try to wash the pain away from me   Away from me      'Cause you're everywhere to me   And when I close my eyes   It's you I see   You're everything I know   That makes me believe   I'm not alone   I'm not alone      When I touch your hand   It's then I understand   The beauty lies within   It's now that we begin   You always light my way   Whenever comes a day   No matter where I go   I always feel you so      'Cause you're everywhere to me   And when I close my eyes   It's you I see   You're everything I know   That makes me believe   I'm not alone      You're everywhere to me   And when I catch my breath   It's you I breathe   You're everything I know   That makes me believe   I'm not alone      And you're everyone I see,   So tell me, do you see me?.I can't sleep   Oh no ....People come and people go   Movin' fast and movin' slow   I'm in a crowd yet I'm all alone   The road is long the road is rough   I do believe I've had enough   I'm gonna turn around and head for home..(Rod Stewart) Sing it to me, Latifah      Oh, I'm singing it to you right now   Cause we're talking about   Moonlight and love songs   Never out of date      Hearts full of passion   Jealousy and hate   Woman needs man   And man must have his mate   That no one can deny      Well, it's still the same old story   A fight for love and glory   A case of do or die   The world will always welcome lovers   As time goes by   As time goes by      Time goes by.Bet you had no idea what your dream would turn out to be..Ding Dong!.The winds of war."
"In the article, The Mooring Mast, by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, the author talks about the many obstacles builders faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State building. The first obstacle they faced involved dropping the mast onto the buildings flat roof. This task would be easy because using a single cable to lower the mast would add a great deal of stress to the buildings frame. Another problem they faced was nature. The violent winds would cause the dirigible to swivel around the mast. The greatest obstacle involved safety. Lots of blimps outside of the @LOCATION2 use highly flammable helium, rather than hydrogen. Helium makes the dirigibles more likely to cause an explosion, and risk many lives of the people of New York. Lastly, existing laws in New York @CAPS1 the balloons to dock. Airships were flying dangerously close over urban areas. Many obstacles were faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building that were mentioned in the article, The Mooring Mast, by Marcia Amidon Lüsted..What, my love, are you contemplating?.[Chorus]   I have to ask myself   like any lover might:   Have you made a fool of me?.Young girl feeling pretty old   Young girl in the band   Rolling into another town   Living the best they can   Across the street, a music store   She gotta find a brand new axe   And there he was, that blue guitar   He was staring her right back, staring her right back   She held him close and he felt just fine   He warmed her up, she know he was just right   Together they cut right through the night   She made herself a local scene   And man that axe could sing and scream   Crying for a big breakthrough   Only small time local news   Just about to pack it in   Mr. Money Biz rolled in   Paid the way and broke the band   A living one night stand, living one night stand   She held him close and he felt just fine   He warmed her up, she know he was just right   Together they cut right through the night   Like touching fire   Like holding desire   Like touching fire   Like holding desire   Take this platinum, take this gold   Burn too hot, it turns you cold   Nothin' left to hold on to   But that guitar was always true, that man was always true   She held him close and he felt just fine   He warmed her up, she know he was just right   Together they cut right through the night   Like touching fire   Like holding desire   Like touching fire   Like holding desire.Eya, pietatis occulo placato,   Cene ligatos fune peccatorum   Ne infernorum ictibus graventur,   Said cum beatis tua prece vecentur.Frosted window panes, candles gleaming inside   Painted candy canes on the tree   Santa's on his way he's filled his sleigh with things   Things for you and for me      It's that time of year when the world falls in love   Every song you hear seems to say   ""Merry Christmas, may your new year dreams come true""   And this song of mine in three quarter time   Wishing you and yours the same thing too      Happy holidays there is snow in the air   Silver bells and sleighs everywhere   People that you meet on any street will smile   It's the season to care      There are songs to sing every family?s a choir   Toys to wrap and bring to the tree   Your own wishing star is not so far from view   Wish a wish or two and I promise you   Christmas wishes can and do come true.Somebody took the papers   And somebody's got the key   And somebody nailed the door shut   That says hey what you think that you see   But me l'm down around the corner   You know I'm lookin' for Miss Linda Lee   Because she's got the power   To love me by the hour   Gives me double you L-O-V-E      Hey baby if you want it so fast   Don't you know that it ain't gonna last   Of course you know   It makes no difference to me      Somebody's got the time time   Somebody's got the right   All of the other people   Tryin' to use up the night   But now me l'm out on the corner   You know I'm lookin' for Miss Linda Lee   Because she's got the power   To love me by the hour   Gives me double you L-O-V-E      Ooh if you want it so fast   Don't you know honey you can get it so fast   But of course you know   It makes no difference to me      Oh oh oh you'd better cool it down   You know you'd better cool it down   You know you'd better cool it down   You know you'd better cool it down      Oh hey if you want it so fast   Now lookie baby don't you want it to last   But of course you know that   It makes no difference to me      Oh you'd better cool it down   You know you'd better cool it down   You know you'd better cool it down.Fare thee well, my honey, fare thee well..You are the sunshine, baby, whenever you smile   But I call you Stormy today   All of a sudden that ol' rain is fallin' down   And my world is cloudy and gray   You've gone away      Old Stormy Stormy   Old Stormy Stormy   Old Stormy Stormy   Old Stormy Stormy      Yesterday's love was alive, the warm summer breeze   But like the weather you changed   Now things are dreary, baby, windy and cold   And I stand alone in the rain   Callin' out your name      Stormy Stormy   Stormy Stormy   Come back to me Stormy   Stormy Stormy      Bring back that sunny day      Yesterday's love was alive, the warm summer breeze   But like the weather you changed   Now things are dreary, baby, windy and cold   And I stand alone in the rain   Callin' out your name      Whoa!.Into the strangers eyes      And who are we to criticize or scorn the things that they do?"
"In The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, it describes many ways the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. It was hard enough for the builders to build the Empire State Building but on top of that they must make a mooring mast at the top. Four term governor of New York Al Smith said it best, ""One set of engineers here in New York is trying to dope out a practical, workable arrangement and the Government people in Washington are figuring out some safe way of mooring airships to this mast."" Another obstacle builders faced was having a thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, only held by a single cable tether, was simply not safe. With this being said, the steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened, costing over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications. No matter how the builders built the Empire State Building they still face nature as an obstacle. These are examples builders faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there..What have I done?.Cannabis   High princess      Where's my stache?.By David Jones   I wake to the sun shining,   Orange and blue skies   Oh, what a feeling deep inside,   It's so hard for me to hide..Night and day, day and night   I do my best to do things right   Never meant to ever hurt nobody   And if I should in some small way   Ever rain on your parade   I will make it up to you I promise      Ever since I met that girl   There's no one else in the whole wide world   Said she'd stay and be with me forever   Mysteries have long been told   About the girl with the heart of gold   And you know I think that I have found her      Chorus      Because every time she looks my way   I lose control, what can I say   She's everything I've ever been after, oh,      I found the girl with the heart of gold   I found the girl with the heart of gold   I found the girl with the heart of gold   I found the girl with the heart of gold.Chorus:   Hip hop rules   And if ya didn't know   Hip hop rules   Kick the ill flow   Hip hop rules   I'm breakin all the news   Hip hop rules   From the old to the new school   Big black skinny nigga   6'4"" with the .44   Got the slow flow it sound like coke dough   In the Benzo smokin on Coco   My blood niggas say I'm true Vatos loco   For real had a Land Cruiser before my deal   Then I copped a 400 Lex and I'm set   Moving through the projects like Tyrannosaurus Rex   Shootin Tex at sets make a ho clits wet   Now I cash big checks tryin to own assets   Built like the Aztecs   Why you niggas ass bet   Remember Ice Ice Baby   Drove you crazy then I was big as Jay-Z   I got paid and I got swayze   Eatin' shrimp with my feet up made me lazy   I bought about 10 cars and about 5 cribs   Out in the woods nobody knows where I live   Got a beautiful wife and two kids   But I'm married to hip hop and that's how it is   Cause   Chorus:   Hip hop rules   And if ya didn't know   Hip hop rules   Kick the ill flow   Hip hop rules   I'm breakin all the news   Hip hop rules   From the old to the new school   It's been a long time since you seen me   On the TV V-Ice is here for sheezy   Takin' what's mine   Cause it's my time to hit y'all with a new style of rhyme   Yeah   This is hip rock it can't be stopped   Bomb tha system   Straight to the top   Millions of dollars I been spendin' em   I love rap, I paved the way for Eminem   Needless to say I rap back today   Y'all forgot about me like y'all forgot about Dre   But I'm still here   With no fear I say what I want and make sure its clear   Yo   I play ball break jaws break all types of laws   Militant haters wanna kill me with a cause   Feel me   I been nice since the P was free back when KRS was runnin shit   Wit BDP   I spit rapnology wack rappers follow me   Let me take you to my Shaolin temple where scholars be   Studying astronomy and the world's prophecy   Giving sight to the blind enabling them to see   It's me GOD equal 4 plus 3   Coped a 6 with the V for the year 2G   Stay blowin on trees, how many guns?.Joey, Joey,   King of the streets, child of clay..Along the coach roads I did ride   With sword and pistol by my side   Many a young maid lost her baubles to my trade   Many a soldier shed his lifeblood on my blade   The bastards hung me in the spring of twenty-five   But I am still alive..Word up   Jealous, jealous,   Yo, it's crazy, I am the one   Bust it      Oh yeah, now I'ma wind it up   It's time to move on and end the Jealousy cut   and head off with a bang that sang and kicked your brain in   I flowed like water now I'm finished explainin   In the spotlight tonight his name was Jealousy   And for some strange reason, it seems fellas be   falling for him, I hope you understood   Stay away from him he ain't no good      You know what I'm saying man yo (that's word yeah I hear that)   Yeah word up (can't hang out man)   Yo it ain't nothing yo ya know what I'm saying   cause we goin' do this (we goin' do it right)   (get involved man) Yo get the champagne man   (just chill).Will you've saved the world two years in a row do you think you have some sort of supervalistic complex   I'm sorry brother supervalistic   Yeah look it up I ain't got time I'm keeping it real I mean do you feel that your supervelous than everybody else   Wait hold hold on hey Charlie Charlie why don't you escort Mr Real inside sow him to a real nice table   Easy easy   You take care Keith"
"There were many obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced when they were attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The first obstacle was the safety of the people. The author states, ""Most dirigibles outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. When the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, on May 6, 1937, the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York."" This would have been a major problem. Another obstacle was the violent air currents that made it hard to land. In this essay it says, ""Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" This quote shows why landing would be dangerous. Finally, it was illegal to fly airships too low over urban areas. The text explains, ""This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building, or even approach the area."" this shows how even if everything worked, they wouldn't be able to do it These are just three of the obstacles that prevented the builders of the Empire State Building from docking dirigibles..Goodbye, no use leading with our chins   This is where our story ends   Never

"Some of the troubles builders came into play with while constructing the empire state buildings mooring mast, were structure, how it would be built, and how it could physically hold a blimp without being ripped out. One problem was figuring out how to reinforce the mast so that the lead could transfer to the foundation instead of ripping off the top half of the building..[Verse 1]   I guess I'm the bad guy   The fingers is pointing   Nigga, I don't go in no clubs without bringing my joint in   They be asking fellas why (why?).(I like you, I like),   (A-M-E-are-I-C-A)..Little Farley   Why you hangin' out so long   I can tell by the people   You're runnin' with   That you're singin' a different song      Little Farley   What you hidin' in your drawer   Don't you know that I know what you're doin'   And it ain't worth dyin' for      Little Farley   Why you takin' that to school   Livin' out your life in Angola   Really don't sound too cool      Little Farley   Why you want to take a life   That little girl they laid to rest today   She coulda been your wife      Little Farley   You know that don't belong to you   What you took in less than a minute   Mighta took him a month or two      Little Farley   A boy don't have to be a man   If you can't decide what you want to be   Then I'm tellin' you no one can      Little Farley   Think about it....The evidence before the court is   Incontrovertible, there's no need for   The jury to retire..And the rocket's red glare, the bombs bursting in air,   Gave proof through the night that our flag was still there..Will you, won't you, will you, won't you, won't you join the dance?.I was cold till you touched me   Fear had no place to hide   I felt nothing but sadness   Love is the great divide      Felt like someone was counting   The tears that rush from my eyes   I was broken and doubting   Love and my own sweet pride      Come clean, come clean   You know where you've been   Slipping and stepping inside   Come clean, come clean   I know that's a dream   Love is the divide      Felt a rush from the mountain   Oh lord, i pushed you aside   I felt nothing but sadness   I'll be alone tonight      How can we lose?.Show me how you question, questions   Lead the way to my temptation   Take my hand and give it cleaning   As I eat cow, I am not proud..Terrorize frozen eyes stare deep in me   Paralyzed inside death breeds on your pain   Pretty lace lie in hate you wear my scars   Terrified you find that you push me too far   Your repulsiveness reminds me of dead flesh   Rotting corpse the smell of your putrid fucking soul      Petrified that I decide the moment of your death   Belongs to me the taste is sweet it's so unreal      Your God weeps, it bleeds, it begs for me   God is letting you recover      Welcome to my Black Serenade   The entrance to my hell your pain   Scream your Song the Black Serenade   Live in fear a mind insane      Voice inside my head   Your face still shows itself to me   Telling me you're dead   Staring at your lifeless body   I saw you fucking die   My mind's tearing itself apart   Screaming from the inside   Release this pain from my fucking heart      Destroy the empty shell   Smash away the haunting fear   I hate your endless stare   Watching as I fuck your corpse      Welcome to my Black Serenade   The entrance to my hell your pain   Walk on through a tortured mind   You'll scream your song in time      Welcome to my Black Serenade   The entrance to my hell your pain   Flesh is burnt the Black Serenade      Live in fear no coming back      Welcome to my Black Serenade   The entrance to my hell your pain   Walk on through a tortured mind   You'll scream your song in time      Welcome to my Black Serenade   The entrance to my hell your pain   Flesh is burnt the Black Serenade   Live in fear death is back"
"The builders of the Empire State Building attempted to create a mast where dirigibles could dock. At first I thought it was a great idea, then realized there were obstacles. First obstacle discovered was ""most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium"" (Lüsted). This was an issue because hydrogen is very flammable and if it were to catch on fire in New York, thousands of people would be hurt/killed. The greatest obstacle was the wind. The amount of wind changed constantly and even if the dirigible was attached properly, the back would continue to move around, which would lead to danger on the streets. The dirigible would be dangling over the pedastrians (Lüsted). One other reason was a legal reason. It was illegal to fly a dirigible too low over urban areas, therefore the dirigible was not allowed to get low enough to land on the building Two tried and neither of them were successful. The constructors of the mooring mast were oblivious to these issues at the beginning, than realized them after. The Empire State Building could not be used to land dirigible due to the fact that non-U.S dirigibles used Hydrogen, the current of the wind changes frequently, and it was illegal to fly the dirigible low enough to attach..Need a chump more that chump?.Two, two, three I was alone   Went to my baby when I get home   Tell my baby the night's away   Come on baby feel like that   Said hey, bo diddley,   Hey, bo diddley, yeah!.Hey!.Doctor, won't you tell me, am I going insane   Was it something I ate or something wrong with my brain   See, I'm naked in church when I meet a dinosaur   Try to run, but my feet have been nailed to the floor   Then a midget pushes me through a revolving door   And I'm back in the very same place I was before      Now I'm stuck in a closet with Vanna White   I'm stuck in a closet with Vanna White   Night after night after night after night      And I can't bust out and I can't break free   And it's gettin' just a little too stuffy here for me   And I can't go home and I can't get loose   And I try to escape but it's just no use      And I can't ever leave and I can't ever win   And we're runnin' outta air and the walls are closin' in   And I can't go back and I can't get through   But Vanna since you're here, why don't you let me buy a vowel from you      Come on Vanna, come on!.I should've been kissing you..Knocked to the floor, left wanting more..I come alive (date with an Angel)      Everyday I prayed that I would find a lover   Then I looked into your eyes and I discovered   Something was changing in my life   Turning the darkness into light      When I'm with you I come alive   I feel I'm living in heaven   You make the wrong turn out so right   I'm gonna love you forever      There is not a thing that I would change about you   And my life was never quite the same without you   You made the rain clouds go away   Bringing me sunshine everyday      When I'm with you I come alive   I feel I'm living in heaven   You make the wrong turn out so right   I'm gonna love you forever      In your arms you make me warm   You give me strength to carry on   I know I won't be alone   As long as I'm with you.I'm feeling cold today   Not hurt just fucked away   I'm devastated and frustrated   God I feel so bound   So why I'd feel the need   I think it's time to bleed   I'm gonna cut myself and   Watch the blood hit the ground      Right now   Can't find a way   To get across the hate   When I see you      Right now   I feel it scratch inside   I want to slash and beat you      Right now   I rip apart the things inside   That live beside you      Right now   I can't control myself   But I fucking hate you!.Shiit, i'm rappin on a dead mic      Chours."
"Many of the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were issues that should have been thought about before construction began. At such a height their whirlwind issues that could push the derigible in undesired directions. ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air current."" (@CAPS1 @NUM1). After the Hindenburg exploded the concerns for the same thing happening was a large safety concern. ""The owners of the Empire State building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York.""

"From the story the Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, the builders faced huge problems when they tried to make it accessable for dirigibles to land. One major factor was the winds at such high altitude, ""The winds on top of building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" The builders not only had to think of a way for the ships to be secure and not low around, but also needed a way to support the weight of the dirigible because of the already heavy building. These are only some of the great problems the builders needed to deal with..page      Hey now, hey now   Don't dream it's over   Hey now, hey now   When the world comes in   They come, they come   To build a wall between us   We know they won't win      Now I'm walking again to the beat of a drum   And I'm counting the steps to the door of your heart   Only shadows ahead barely clearing the roof   Get to know the feeling of liberation and release      Hey now, hey now   Don't dream it's over   Hey now, hey now   When the world comes in   They come, they come   To build a wall between us   We know they wont win...Could you ever know that out somewhere   There's a boy who really hurts?.My father was reading, the holy books in his room,   My heart was just bleeding, I knew I had to go soon,   He smiled and pointed at an old wooden chair,   I wanted to hold him, but then I just wouldn't dare..I said that I'll be loving you, always   with a love that's true, always..C'mon and take the time..I got the gauge, a uzi and the mothafuckin 22   So if you wanna blast, nigga we can buck 'em   If we stick 'em then we stuck 'em so fuck 'em!"".Juda-ah-as!.Perfect."
"The builders of the Empire State building faced many obstecles in attemping to allow dirigibles to dock there. The one obstacle to their expanded use in New York City was the lack of suitable landing area. to solve this problem, Al Smith built a mooring mast.

"The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles (Blimps) to dock there was that there were way too many risks that were being taken to make this mast and it was just too dangerous.I think that the mast opposed too many risks because for one it would be flying too low and two, if it caught on fire or was hit by lightning it would explode and people would get seriously hurt, OR the mast could snap off!As @PERSON1 said, ""The as yet unsolved problems of mooring air ships to a fixed mast at such a height made it desirable to postpone to a later date the final installation of the landing gear.""@CAPS1 @PERSON1 Clavan means is that the fact that there are so many problems with mooring air ships to this ""mast"" that it just isn't safe to go through with right now!.The things you're liable   To read in a bible      Ain't necessarily so..My driveway looks somethin' like a parkin' lot..One day you'll understand      [Bridge]   So hear me out, hear me out   I won't go, I won't go   No goodbyes, no goodbyes   Just hello, just hello   And when you cry, I will cry   And when you smile, I will smile   And next time when I look in your eyes   We'll have wings and we'll fly      [Hook 3]   Hello my only one, just like the mornin' sun   You'll keep on risin' 'til the sky knows your name   And you're still my chosen one   Remember who you are   No you're not perfect but you're not your mistakes      [Outro]   Hey, hey, hey, hey   Tell Nori about me, tell Nori ab (I just want you to do me a favor)   Tell Nori about me   Tell Nori about me   Tell Nori about me   Tell Nori about me   Tell Nori about me   Tell Nori about me   Tell Nori about me   Tell Nori about me   Tell Nori about me.Take time, take it easy..But when I look in your eyes and see the harmonies   And the heartaches soften      I'm getting in tune   Right in tune   I'm in tune   And I'm gonna tune      Right in on you (right in on you)   Right in on you (right in on you)   Right in on you      I've got it all here in my head   There's nothing more needs to be said   I'm just bangin' on my old piano   I'm getting in tune with the straight and narrow      (Getting in tune with the straight and narrow)   Getting in tune with the straight and narrow   (Getting in tune with the straight and narrow)   Yeah, I'm getting in tune with the straight and narrow   (Getting in tune with the straight and narrow)      I'm singing this note 'cause it fits in well   With the way I'm feeling   There's a symphony that I hear in your heart   Sets my head a-reeling      But I'm in tune   Right in tune   I'm in tune   And I'm gonna tune      Right in on you (right in on you)   Right in on you (right in on you)   Right in on you      Baby, with you   Baby, with you   Baby, with you   Baby, with you   Baby, with you      I've got it all here in my head   There's nothing more needs to be said   I'm just bangin' on my old piano   I'm getting in tune with the straight and narrow      [Repeat: x2]   Getting in tune with the straight and narrow.His eyes   Were made of meatballs and his name was Aikendrum..You chase the light in front of you, nightfall close behind..[Chorus]      Why is it when I say I love you,   You shy away from me,   When lovin's all I want to do?.A week went by, the summer came down,   Soon another girl on the island he found."
"When building the Empire State Building, the builders had to overcome many obsticles. One obsticle, for example, was a lack of suitable landing area. The dirigibles were very large, some spanding @NUM1 feet, therefore in a city of buildings, there were not many suitable areas to land. Another obsticle they had overcome was the fact that the city did not allow the dirigibles to be that close to rural areas. Although these reasons are plenty enough, the article mentions that perhaps the greatest obsticle was nature itself. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"" (pg. @NUM2-paragraph @NUM3). All in all, the idea to land dirigibles in this place was too unrealistic..To grow..Everybody wants to go to heaven but nobody wants to die   Everybody wants to go to heaven but nobody wants to die   Once upon a time there lived a man and his name was Isaac   He walked with God both day and night but he didn't wanna die   He cried oh Lord please let me live death is close I know   God smiled down on Isaac and gave him fifteen years to go   Everybody wants to go to heaven but nobody wants to die   Lord I wanna go to heaven but I don't wanna die   So I long for the day when I'll have new birth still I love the livin' here on earth   Everybody wants to go to heaven but nobody wants to die   [ guitar ]   When Jesus lived here on this earth he knew his father's plan   He knew that he must give his life to save the soul of men   When Judas had betraied him her father heard him cry   He was brave until his death but he didn't wanna die   Everybody wants to go to heaven...

" The obstacles that the builders of the Empire state building faced attempting to make the dock for dirigibles.The architects desgned a shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel tower. They would have to make the Empire State Building strong enough to have the wind blowing around up on top. In the late run they would have to face the law. These are the obstacles that the builders had to face..It could be ..Don't be cool, don't be slick, you just keep on swingin', keep on swingin'   Keep on swingin' swing!.Sacrifice the virgins, spiritual rites..I've got sunshine on a cloudy day   When it's cold outside I've got the month of May   I guess you'd say   What can make me feel this way?.Singing this song to you   Aw shucks   If you can hear me sing   You better come home like you supposed to do      Can you see me?.We're on our own, cousin,   All alone, cousin..Well, I ain't no cheatin' man   Don't try to fool no girls   I ain't no cheatin' man   Don't try to fool no girls   It's my regular lovin'   That gets me by in this world....Better by far this way..You might see me in the spot   Ya boy think I'm hot   So I came up in here to get what you got   I'm hot like the block   Uh huh, you like that   Know you wanna bite that   Uh huh, yeah, right there   They love the young girl   They wanna give it to me   Wish I was in a flick   And I ain't talking movies   If ya young, if ya hot, girl   Shake what ya got, girl   I keep 'em singing...

"There were many obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced. One of the obstacles faced was when trying to dock on top of the building. Since it was so tall, there were very harsh winds that the dirigibles could be controlled. When the Los Angeles tried to dock there, it couldn't, because ""[it] could not get close enough to tie up because of forceful winds."" Also, ""the @CAPS1. could not even take his hands off the control levers."" because the dirigible might bump into other buildings if he did. Another obstacle they faced was that New York was densely populated and the mooring mast was surrounded by other buildings. If it caught on fire like the Hindenburg it could be a huge problem. ""... how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area."" The third huge obstacle they faced was that there was an actual law against anything flying that low in cities. There was, ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" This meant that the dirigibles couldn't even get close enough to tie up since they were allowed to fly down to it. Since there were so many apparent obstacles and flaws in the plan, the builders should've caught it before and never built the mooring mast above the Empire State Building.I'm a devil or an angel who come running when you need her..Homemade love..- We'll touch the sky   But why the tears there?.And why must we grow up so fast?.Some kind of monster....And radiate your sweet temptation..Ba-ba-ba-Bah!.We can't go on pretending day by day   That someone somewhere will soon make a change..Tommy Mottola lives on the road   He lost his lady two months ago   Maybe he'll find her, maybe he won't,   oh, oh, never, nooo   He sleeps in the back of his grey Cadillac, oh my honey   Blowing his mind on cheap grass and wine   Oh ain't it crazy baby, hey   Guess you could say hey, hey   This man has learned his lesson, oh hey   Now he's alone   He's got no woman and no home   For misery, oh, oh   Cherchez la femme   Miggie, Miggie Bonija's very upset   She's sick and tired of living in debt   Tired of roaches, tired of rats, I know she is oooh   So her noble man says,   ""Baby I understand, oh my honey""   Now he's working two jobs at Eighth Avenue bars   Oh ain't crazy baby   Now she complains   That her man is never present, no   She goes next door, I know that she's just playing the whore   Hey for misery (my friend)   Cheechez la femme   They tell you a lie with a colgate smile, hey baby   Love you one second and hate the next one   Oh ain't it crazy, yeah   All I can say , ay, hey, og one thing I am certain, oh, oh   They're all the same, all the sluts and the saints For misery (my friend), ""Cherchez la femme"""
"The @CAPS1 of the Empire State Building in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there was a lot of work. They had to spend a whole lot of money and it wasn't a easy job. They spended over sixty thousand dollars on just modifications. I know this because in paragraph @NUM1 it said ""over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications had to be made to the building frame work. @CAPS2 you can see they spended a lot of money on the mooring mast.Also it wasn't a easy job to make everything work there was a lot of things they had to worrie about like safety issues.

"While attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State building the workers faced many obstacles. One of the obstacles was safety. While the dirigible, or zeppelin, was docked its body would sway in the breeze. This lead to a question of safety for the passengers getting on and off. Also there was no safe way to weigh the dirigible down, like when the dirigible lands in a field. Any weights used would be hanging over pedestrians.  Another obstacle was the law prohibiting airships flying low over urban areas This law made it illegal for dirigibles to dock or approach the area The main obstacle was nature itself. There are very violent winds at the top of the Empire State Building which would cause the dirigible to sway. Docking at the Empire State Building was too complicated for the idea to be completed..But can ya' lean low, bitch to the flo'?.So if you are confused and don't know which way to go..Cause we know that you love all that power   Is it on then, are we on the brink?.Shame shame shame on you Miss Roxy   Shame shame shame on you Miss Roxy   Shame shame, shame on what you done, yeah      You made me sweaty   Talkin' I was skin and bones   You cause your lovers grief   Oh, look at me now      Shame shame shame on you Miss Roxy, that's right   Shame shame shame on you Miss Roxy   Shame shame, a shame on what you done   You know what ya done   You wanna butt   You wanna what   You want to, hey, hey, hey, hey      Yeah, well I was offered dice   I gav'em a touchin' hymn   But then the game broke a loose   Oh, you were the reason      Shame shame shame on you Miss Roxy   Yeah, shame shame shame on you Miss Roxy   Shame shame, shame on what you done, hey, hey, hey, hey      And now you're talkin' back   Well I can tell your plan   You oughta eat my words down on your knees      Shame shame shame on you Miss Roxy   Yeah yeah yeah yeah, shame shame shame on you Miss Roxy   Shame shame, a shame on what you done, well      Shame shame a shame on you Miss Roxy   Shame shame shame shame   Shame shame shame shame, you shame on you,   Shame on what you done, yeah   Shame shame, shame on what you done, who yeah who yeah, yeah.I'm really sorry that I can't be there but work comes first, I'm sure you'll understand..For the ones who abuse his name   There'll be no chance to escape   On judgment day      In the name of God, the fight for gold   These were the changes..We're squirrels..Mr. Rockefeller I could use a few   If you'd like to send a few down my way..Faster, faster, to welcome disaster   Faster, faster, to welcome disaster."
"In the excerpt The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, it describes many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building had to face in order to allow dirigibles to dock there. The first obstacle they had to face was the constant change in nature and how it could affect the dirigibles. The dirigibles would ""swivel around"" because of the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" This could put pedestrians on the street in danger because the ship is on top moving and could be unstable. Another obstacle is safety. Outside the United States the dirigibles ""used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" Other countries ships could set on fire in the United States and put people in danger. Also the fact that the loading dock was more than 1,250 feet and loading off could be unstable because of the winds. The last obstacle faced was the ""existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas"". Therefore it was illegal to get the dirigibles close enough to the buildings safely. All these obstacles faced made the workers and planners realize this idea could not be achieved without harming anyone or putting people in danger..let me prove it to you..I come home in the morning light   My mother says when you gonna live your life right   Oh mother dear we're not the fortunate ones   And girls they want to have fun   Oh girls just want to have fun      The phone rings in the middle of the night   My father yells what you gonna do with your life   Oh daddy dear you know you're still number one   But girls they want to have fun   Oh girls just want to have      That's all they really want   Some fun   When the working day is done   Girls they want to have fun   Oh girls just want to have fun Some boys take a beautiful girl   And hide her away from the rest of the world   I want to be the one to walk in the sun   Oh girls they want to have fun   Oh girls just want to have      That's all they really want   Some fun   When the working day is done   Girls they want to have fun   Oh girls just want to have fun,   They want to have fun,   They want to have fun....Long as it's always ""we""..And I'm looking to get wet   You f-cking with the keys and I play the clarinet   I guess you musta heard I'm the baddest bitch around   So it is going down like a muthfa-cking frown   And this is going up when you see me in my skirt   When they see me, they go uhh, leave them bitches in the dirt   When they see me they go ohh yeah bitch there puts in work   And I'm f-cking with the?.That means we're heading into   Brand new unknown territorys y'all..Your father was a rounder   He played that rock and roll   A leaper and a bounder   Down to his gypsy soul   The music was his angel   And sorrow was his star   And those of us who follow   Might hope to reach as far      They're walking slow in Houston   Speechless in D.C..Don't feel guilty, master writing      Somebody said that they're not much like I am   I know I can   Make enough of the words for you to follow along   I sink and then some      Slippery pessimist hypocrite master   Conservative communist apocalyptic bastard   Thank you dear God for putting me on this earth   I feel very privileged in debt for my thirst      Hold me down in restitution   Living out your date with fusion   Is the whole fleece shun in master?.How can you mend all the heartaches that you've made ?.Everyday goodbyes   (Repeat)"
"When the architects and builders were planning on how to build the mast onto the Empire State Building, they faced many obstacles.  An example of an obstacle they faced was they had to construct the mast so it wouldnt fall off when a dirigible docked.  They couldnt use cable.  tether to hold the mast down because it put to much stress on the building's frame and foundation.  Another obstacle the builders had to face was how to strengthen the Empire State Building's frame.  In order to get the Empire State Building's frame strong enough to hold the mast, it would cost over sixty thousand dollars.  Those are some examples of obstacles builders had to face..Flow to the sea,   You know where to go..A day late a buck short   I'm writing the report   On losing and failing   When I move I'm flailing now      And it'll happen once again I'll turn to a friend   Someone that understands   Sees through the master plan      But everybody's gone   And I've been here for too long   To face this on my own   Well I guess this is growing up      Well I guess this is growing up      And maybe I'll see you   At a movie sneak preview   You'll show up and walk there   On the arm of that girl   And I'll smile and you'll wave   We'll pretend it's okay   The charade it won't last   When she's gone I won't come back      And it'll happen once again I'll turn to a friend   Someone that understands   Sees through the master plan      But everybody's gone   And I've been here for too long   To face this on my own   Well I guess this is growing up      Well, I guess this is growing up [4x]   Well, I guess this is growing up.What, I'm still in love with you baby..Sometimes it's hard   When I don't know where you going   Or where you bin   I got a broken heart   Let me know you care for me   My heart will ment      Darlin' I can't wait forever   You got to let me know   Or let me go   All I'm seein' is   You can't keep playin' with   A heart been love you so who know      [Chorus:]   Security   That's what we need to keep our love strong   Security   Don't make me wait to long   Security   And gotta let me know if this is what you want   Security   Don't keep me hanging on      I'm sure you know   If you take the time to think about it   You would realize hold it or not   Do long ago are used to care around that's lover   You're my only die   Wecy bell you waits your situation   That it check up your pryority   You got to get to it straights your vesitation   If what you want is me      [Chorus: x2]      Darlin' I can't wait forever   You got to let me know   Or let me go   All I'm seein' is   You can't keep playin' with   A heart been love you so uh ho      [Chorus: x2]      Security   I can't wait forever   Tell me   Security   Are we gonna be together you got to let me know   Hey hey   Security   Hey hey   You know what I need   Security don't keep me hanging on      No baby no darling   If you tell me that your lovin'   Can't you show me what you need   No baby you got to give to me uh.Can you show me where it hurts?.Slow down your rhymes and try to reason   Can't make things move any faster,   By second wishing them to death..In the early mornin' rain   With a dollar in my hand   And an achin' in my heart   And my pockets full of sand      I'm a long way from home   And I miss my loved one so   In the early mornin' rain   With no place to go      Out on runway number nine   Big 707 set to roll   But I'm stuck here on the ground   Where the pavement never grows      The liquor tasted good   And the women all were fast   Well there she goes, my friend   She's movin' out at last      Hear the mighty engines roar   See the silver wings on high   She's away and westward bound   High above the clouds she'll fly      Where the mornin' rain don't fall   And the sun always shines..Where do they go?.Oh Dindi ."
"The Empire State Building faced numerous problems in allowing dirigibles to dock there. The most important reason was the safety of the people. Most dirigibles used hydrogen instead of helium to power their dirigibles and hydrogen is extremely flammable The death toll would be astronaumical over a dense population as downtown New York. Another obstacle faced in this creation was nature. The winds at the top of the Empire State Building were constantly shifting and the idea of a dirigible dangling high above pedestrians was not safe. The last reason that the dirigibles were not safe was the existing law in the U.S. At the time of the building of the Empire State Building, a law existed that prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas. Therefore, the dirigible was to close to the ground and was not allowed to dock. The idea of dirigibles docking at the Empire State Building is a phenomenal idea, however, there are to many obstacles prohibiting it..Said you're everything I never wanted to want, it's you..La vie moi, dans mes yeux mouilles oh   Feuilles oh, sauv?.Terrified of being wrong..How could I turn into stone?.I've been down, I've been down too far to care   I keep getting in my car but I'm not going anywhere   And I've been had, well at least that's how it looks   And it's not funny like on TV and it's not smart like it is in books   And I wonder, yeah, I wonder how the world keeps spinnin' around   Where's a boy with bad intentions gonna settle down?.CROWD   EVITA!.I love the the Lord, he heard my cry   And pitied every groan, long as I, I live   And troubles rise, I hasten to his throne      [Chorus]   Oh, I love the Lord   I sure do, surely do love the Lord   He heard, he heard my cry   And pitied every groan, yes he did   Every groan   Long as I live, long as I, I live   And troubles rise, troubles rise   I hasten to to to to to   I'll hasten, I'll hasten to his throne   I'll hasten to his throne hold on hold on   Tears are streaming down my eyes   I'll hasten, I'll hasten to his throne      Yes I will, I'll run   I know I can go to his throne   I know I can go, I know I can go   I'll hasten, I'm gonna run   I know I can go, I know I can go   I'll hasten, I'll hasten to his throne      See I can run, Lord you know I will   When there is nowhere to go I know I can go to you   I know I can run to you oh   I'll hasten, I'll hasten to his, his throne   Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah   I'll hasten, hasten to his throne   Surely gonna be here.Easy as one, two, three   It's like counting up to three   Or simple as Do re mi   Sing a simple melody   That's how easy love can be!.I find hard to breathe   As life just eats away   At the faces that surround me   They look tired today   The lady at my table   Doesn't want me here   I just want to talk to her   But would she laugh to my accent   And make fun of me   It doesn't seem like   The blue sky's here for me      There are no girls in here   As far as I can see   Only pin-up posters   Looking down at me   Watching papercups of coffee   Growing cold before my eyes   All the things I see   That makes me realize   I'm in this big world without you   Nothing tomy name   I never knew that   Blue sky meant such pain      I'm dying to be different   In the coffee shop   I lived to double strength   Now my supplies are cut   Oh, I'm older than my looks   And older than my years   I'm too young to take on   My deepest fears   I used to be confused   But now I just don't know   Since you left I've been watching   Blue skies come and go"
"The main problem in the original design of the mooring mast was that ""the architects could'nt just drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof. A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame. The stress of the dirigible's load & the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the buildings foundation."" Another obstacle the builders faced with the construction of the mast could be another example of the German dirigible ""Hindenburg"". With some dirigibles using the highly flammable hydrogen instead of helium another ""Hindenburg accident"" could prove to be fatal in a ""highly populated area such as downtown New York."" @CAPS1 perhaps the greatest obstacle would be ""nature itself."" The high force winds on top of the empire state building would cause the dirigible to swivel around the mooring mast. Although the dirigibles could be weighted down, the weights would be hanging over pedestrians, which ""was neither practical nor safe."".c'mon....Miss Otis regrets she's unable to lunch today..Harry Braff..May I take a liberty   And say that it' s a shame to me   Not to live in harmony   We're all just hoping   Someone will step forward singing...

"In the 1930's, the idea to have a mooring mast mounted on the top of the Empire State Building for dirigibles to dock was a very popular theory. However, there were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced, such as existing laws concerning airships, flammable, hydrogen dirigibles, strong winds, and the stress a moored dirigible would add to the buildings frame. Existing ""air traffic laws would make it illegal for a ship to tie up to the Empire State Building or even fly near it, since airships couldn't fly too low over urban areas (paragraph @NUM1). The destruction of the Hindenburg, a hydrogen dirigible, helped the owners of the Empire State building realize how dangerous dirigibles could be, especially if they combusted over downtown New York City (paragraph @NUM2). Strong winds also would be hazardous to dirigibles moored to the empire state building, seeing as the aircrafts couldn't be way down in the air (paragraph @NUM3). The steel frame of the building would also have to be modified to accommodate the stress added by a moored dirigible. All in all, it was very unrealistic to more dirigibles to the Empire State Building, as it would be unsafe..Refrain:   Hallelujah, hallelujah   Is the jubilant refrain   God is sending us a Savior   Peace on earth, good will to man..Don't you know things can change   Things'll go your way   If you hold on for one more day   Can you hold on for one more day   Things'll go your way   Hold on for one more day      I know that there is pain   But you hold on for one more day and   Break free the chains   Yeah I know that there is pain   But you hold on for one more day and you   Break free, break from the chains      Some day somebody's gonna make you want to   Turn around and say goodbye   Until then baby are you going to let them   Hold you down and make you cry   Don't you know?.Oooh..Ooooh   I tell you it will shake the earth beneath your feet   The light that shines will redefine your old beliefs   What you reap is what you sow and so it goes   Where you plant your needs is where your garden grows   Before you think about yourself   Think of someone else, it will make you feel      Each day ain't wine and roses   I doubt it's meant to be   Always a cross to bear salvation don't come free   A heart that beats is a heart that bleeds   And you know that's true   So don't deny yourself of something good for you   Before you do it for yourself, do it for someone else   That makes it real      [Chorus]   'Cause when you love someone   It don't matter what you say   When you love someone   You will dance the night away   When you love someone   There ain't nothing you can't do   Ain't that right   Yeah I want to love someone tonight      Will you believe in love or just sit around and judge?.Its so much easier   When sea foam green is in fashion   You you oh   Are you in?.""who's this guitar-playing sonsa bitch?.Does your group have more cavities than theirs?.9 coal   And the store boss said well bless my soul..Out on the town kicking around feeling bluesy   It's getting late I can't afford to be choosy   Should be home and dry by now   Tried every trick in the book but      Another night Saturday night and I'm losing   Another night Saturday night and I'm losing      The DJ plays a song from the past I remember   I hold her tight in my arms she surrenders   It's the same old record playing   But it's a different girl that's swaying      [Chorus:]   As we move around the room   Whispering things with my eyes closed   I feels that you're here   Then the music stops I open my eyes   My fantasy ends we're not even friends      So leave me to catch my ride pay my fare on my way home   The same thing every week on my own   Next time around you might be there   My luck might change but until then      [Chorus:].Will the world ever be   A place of peace and harmony   With no war and with no brutality?"
"The builders of the Empire State Building in New York faced many obstacles while attempting to allowed dirigibles to dock. One obstacle of the builders was creating the Empire State Building with the strength to hold the dirigible, swaying in the wind, without the building falling over. The weight of the dirigible would have to be transferred to the bottom of the building which was almost eleven hundred feet below. The largest obstacle, however, was holding the dirigible in place while it was docked atop the building. The winds were ""constantly shifting due to violent air currents"" and would make the dirigible fly wildly around the top of the building (@CAPS1 paragraph @NUM1).

A dirigible is a blimp, giant steel balloons that are filled with hydrogen and helium. Dirigibles had a lack of suitable landing area in New York. Al Smith was a four-term governor of New York. He came up with the idea that a mooring mast being added to the Empire State building would allow dirigibles to anchor there, fuel up and passengers could safely get on and off the dirigible. The architects and builders had to consult with experts so they took workers at the @ORGANIZATION2, tested the mass and met with president of a recently formed airship transport company. After all those obstacles they could finally build the mooring mast.I Got The Law (x23)      Feeling Dove beyond con-pen (Convict Penitentiary)   Nobody can take it there   Feel it now and do yourself until you're gone   Tomorrow never more....Tell the people that you saw me passing through..So he is all you need   I'm sayin' all on top of me   I say I'm tryin' to mean   So get your ecstasy   I know it ain't no remedy   You'se addicted to my pussy   I'm the only vaccine   For you aeropostale code   My lust infectious   My lust infectious   My lust infectious   Gotcha beggin' for more   My lust infectious   My lust infectious My lust infectious   Gotcha sweatin' for more   My stomachs' got him turnin' back   Got the bottle baby just relax   Watch me put on biggy C's   There's no shirt no panties   I know baby this ain't my train   Glad you make it shh on me   You know I'm gonna make it rain   So come and fill my heart with la-a-a-a-ove.children yeah!.The world's had enough of Eminem (Jiggy jiggy)   Even his girlfriend's cheatin on him..One he got a dream of love,   Deep as the ocean..Ooh, Bernadette, Bernadette..Just shine a light into the wreckage, so far away, away   [Chorus]   Cause I'm still breathing   Cause I'm still breathing on my own   My head's above the rain and roses   Making my way, my way   Cause I'm still breathing   Cause I'm still breathing on my own   My head's above the rain and roses   Making my way, my way   My way to you      [Verse 2]   I'm like a junkie tying off for the last time   I'm like a loser that's betting on his last dime   Oh, I'm still alive   I'm like a son that was raised without a father   I'm like a mother barely keeping it together   Oh, I'm still alive      [Pre-Chorus]   Am I bleeding?.I see your smiling face, by the open door   There's the morning light   Shining in your hair, and in your eyes      And just a little way behind that smile of yours   I see another one, oh so far away   If only for one second, I could hold you close to me   When the Master calls for me again   There's nothing I can say, or I can do      Goodbye, my love   Time has come to say farewell   I hear the call again   Goodbye to the world   I've shouted for so long   Oh there's so much my love, that I can never say      And in a little while, in a little while   There's nothing left to see      As the years go by and I have not returned   And the night has come, falling all around   Ooh if you count the stars you'll know   How many have gone out   And when the Master calls for me again   There's nothing that I can say   Or I can do      Stand in the sun   Shut your eyes and feel the world   It's changing every day   Goodbye my love   Each day will seem so long   Ooh there's so much I feel, that I can never say      I can't see you   I can't feel you anymore   I've just a memory of that open door"
"The-builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock there. Safety was the biggest concern at each stage. The recent explosion of the Hindenburg showed potential problems in docking these aircraft. If a blimp was to explode in downtown New York, it could be a disaster. Another obstacle that would be faced is nature. The winds on the top of the building were constantly changing. The unpredictable wind atop the building made the idea of mooring a zeppelin very illogical. At this time, laws against flying low in urban areas were coming around. These would make for docking the airships to be illegal. The idea for making the Empire State Building a mooring post was an engineering feat but the actual usage of it was not practical..Had a thought that you might be coming home   Made myself up while I was alone   You said one thing and now it's a shame   That you're leaving without anything   To say   You believed that the stars come from the left   I have something you might need to know the rest   You believe   It's okay   Everybody's just looking out north   For that one dream that comes every night   In your smile there are many a ways to cut   Your pain   Uh-huh.What may appear   Might easily be explained,   But given the situation   Of info saturation,   What you feel can never go away..I got money stacks credential, now still ain't spent old bred,   If you wanna gladly pour some change on your own head..Boo, hoo, hoo, boo, hoo, hoo,   Cry, cry, cry, cry..There is a bill being discussed right now   That would bring the army into the interior of our country   And do you know where we'd be then?.I went looking for the answers from someone I heard believes that life gets easier..I'll walk home this evening   Through the lonely market place   I'll sleep well, I'll dream well,   Because tomorrow I can say ""Buongiorno Teresa""   I love you more each day!.Some say love it is a razor   That leaves your soul to bleed..When nothing else could help   Love lifted me."
"The obstacles the builders faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock is that a thousand-foot dirigibe moored at the top of the building would add stress to the building's frame. Also the stress of the dirigibe's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted. It would need to transmitted to the buildings foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below. The steel frame would have to be modified and strengthened this would be over sixty thousand dollars..little dreamer dreamer on!.You're my only shawty, yee yee yee (baby, come clean! ).And did you say that she loves you?.I've played many parts   And I'm the first to agree   That I'm still lookin' round for the man that is me      I'm a dreamer by nature   And I've always been   Looking for something not there   My financial position   Don't bother my dreams   'Cause in fairy tale money   I'm my own millionaire      What is the part   That I'll play today   Beggar, a business man, king for a day?.Say the word, say the word but don't say no   Skydive, you and I, with just these clothes   The secret's safe with me   There's no right time or place   'Cause anyone can see we'll do it anyway      'Cause we got all night   We're going nowhere   Why don't you stay   Why don't we go there?.Yes, we do what we want..Go on let me go easy..Our love was a star to wish upon..An overaged boy of 39 has left the wing today   The first time in his life he's made that step   Be numbed by the society and plagued by insecurity   He's entered in a race that must be won   One of the animals has left its cage today   In search of better things, so it seems to be   But in this land of polyurethane,   things are apt to get a bit hot      As the toys go winding down      C.G."
"The builders of the Empire State Building faced tremendous obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. First, new friends would have to include more money. Anything done so top of a building so large would have to be balanced by strengthening the foundation. According to paragraph @NUM1, ""over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework."" Another large obstacle the builders would have to deal with was finding a way to neutralize the violent wind currents atop the @DATE1 ft. building. Even if the front of the dirigible was anchored to the mooring, the back would be left to sway in the wind, Any accident or damage done to a dirigible over such a highly populated area such as downtown New York would have devastating results. In conclusion, the risks of allowing dirigibles to dock atop the Empire State Building outweighed the rewards. When dirigible travel became less practical, the plan was scrapped completely..It's my time to shine, do it my way cuz it's my time baby   It's my time to burn, start a fire, be the one and only   I said it   I meant it   I never will forget it   Change never happens by itself   It's my time to burn, my time to shine..Lord help the mister who comes between me and my sister,   And Lord help the sister who comes between me and my man..Stick it up, mister   Hear what I say, sir, yeah   Get your hands in the air, sir   And you will get no hurt, mister, no no no   I said, ""Yeah""   (I said, ""Yeah"")   What did I say?.Where is the love you once gave me?.If it stayed I'd never leave it   If that turned around I'd grieve   The special dirty things   That we used to talk about   I mean that loving you is strange   And adored by me throughout   Oh no it's you again   Someday soon you'll find that someone   Waiting for the chance to beat you   Drooling on the set to feel you   Blessing you with every kiss      Tying yourself to me, stitch up my emptiness   Cause you're the death of me   So precious loving the thrill   Tying yourself to me, stitch up my emptiness   Cause you're the death of me   So precious loving the thrill      Such the patient one who needs me   The spoiled one who wins   So shocking where's your sense   Don't you know I hate you so   Unsatisfied you little girl      Tying yourself to me, stitch up my emptiness   Cause you're the death of me   So precious loving the thrill   Tying yourself to me, stitch up my emptiness   Cause you're the death of me   So precious loving the thrill      Rolling dice and seeming queer   Bastard love a sick affair,   Lets see what new disease you'll fetch,   I mean that fucking you is strange   And adored by me thoughout   Oh no it's you again   Blessing you with every kiss      So precious you know this hate of mine exploded   I'm so deranged you know   I will never be the same      Tying yourself to me, stitch up my emptiness   Cause you're the death of me   So precious loving the thrill   Tying yourself to me, stitch up my emptiness   Cause you're the death of me   So precious loving the thrill      So precious loving the thrill      So precious loving the thrill      Cause you're the death of me      So precious loving the thrill.Goodbye romance can't take a chance   On love's painful games   I've called too many times on a sweetheart tree      Lady lost now I count the cost   Nothing seems to change   I've called too many times on the sweetheart tree      Too many times   Ooh love you made a fool out of me   You won again   So lovin' set me free      I need some time to change my mind   Before I try again   I've been too many times to the sweetheart tree      Some go some then lay in tow   But love just don't come free   I've called too many names on the sweetheart tree      Too many times   Ooh love you made a fool out of me   You won again   So lovin' set me free      Too many times   Ooh love you made a fool out of me   You won again   So lovin' set me free      Goodbye romance can't take a chance   On love's painful games   I've called too many names on the sweetheart tree.There's a lot of people   Spreading nasty rumors 'bout me   Every word is a lie   So I'm singing this song   'Cause the history books   Have been telling it wrong!.(Feat..My heart would never lie down, down,   'Cause that's the way my arrow flies,   And that's the way that I want it."
"In this excerpt from ""The Mooring Mast"", @ORGANIZATION2 describes the architectural, chemical, and legal challenges that prevented the construction of a mooring dock for dirigibles on the top of the Empire State Building. Despite the readiness of then- @CAPS1 Al Smith, who publicly announced the plan, and of John Tauranac, who reported that the top of the Empire State Building ""would serve a higher calling [than] to add a desired few feet,"" @ORGANIZATION2 contends that the failure of the mast ""should have been apparent before it was ever constructed"".According to the article, the mast, and a moored dirigible, ""would add stress to the building's frame."" More than sixty thousand dollars was spent to accommodate the pressure. Foreign dirigibles also contained hydrogen, which was more flammable than American-used helium. An explosion above the Empire State Building would be devastating to the city. An existing law prevented dirigibles from ""even approach[ing]"" the building. @ORGANIZATION2 uses these reasons to detail the unrealistic nature of the mooring mast..Grab the microphone and say a check one two   The kid's solo   Unafraid of any crew   ''cause I'm the type of mother with the maddest   Status   Statue or poll   Paid in full   No bull never dull   Always in control   Taking no shit like I was Manute Boll   Ugh...

"The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there where difficult. One of the obstecles they faced was fixing the Empire State Building and the cost was high. For example in the excerpt it said ""The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate the new situation over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework."" The plan never fully went thru because safety was an issue. Fire and people getting hurt on the streets was a big risk they could not make. It was also illegal for airships to fly too low over urban areas.

"There were three main obstacles in building a dock for dirigibles on top of the Empire State Building. The first problem was safety. Most dirigibles from outside of the U.S. were flammable because they ""used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" When the Hindenburg was destroyed, they realized that it would have been much worse over a highly populated city. Another problem was nature. Winds were ""constantly shifting due to violent air currents,"" and the back of the dirigible would ""swivel around and around the mooring mast."" The third problem was that there was a law in place. As Lüsted says, ""[there] was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas.""the building would have to be much taller in order for the ships to even approach it..Give it up!.I was in the army   But I never dug a trench   I used to bust my knuckles   On a monkey wrench   Then I'd go to town and drink   And give the girls a pinch   But I don't think   They ever even noticed me..Fuck is up, now man I'm in this hoe,   Life is moving fast, where the fuck do all these minutes go,   Mixtape dropped then I started getting 10 a show,   Now I get a hundred what the fuck you think I'm in it for,   Young money forever, I bet Gudda, Jae and Mack agree,   Fuck you to the haters that just spend their time attacking me,   Shout out to your girlfriend nigga lately she distracting me,   Wondering if I'm the best, Will I..Hey, bride of mine   I love you   So why'd you find another   Who would make   Love with you?.Burn the schools!.Confront your enemies, avoid them when you can..Or do they navigate in dark?.Follow me instead..When you finally get back up on your feet again,   Everybody wants to be your old long-lost friend."

"Al Smith and the engineers faced many obsticles attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building. One obsticle that they faced was that most of the dirigibles used hydrogen, hydrogen is a very flammable chemical, this could have led to the Empire State Building burning down and killing millions. Another obsticle they faced was mother nature, In a height like 1,250 ft, theire are incredible winds blowing, and someone even unexpected, they can blow the dirigible into the building, causing it to be fatal. Findly, the law prohibites the dirigible to be ""flying too low over urban areas."" therefore doing this would be illegal. the building faced many obstacle, it got through most of them, but in the end it would be extremly unsafe to go on with mast..Baby, you're cool   And even though you've never been to school   I know you're fine   But then you change your mind   Then you start on driftin'   And fall on behind      You've been my girl   You've been mine   All of the time      A bad night   Its gonna be   A bad night   I guarantee   Tonight I'll have   A bad night   I know I shall      Ah, 'cause you left me waiting in the corner   And I know you're never gonna come back for me   And though you said you loved me   And said you needed all of my love   A bad, bad, bad, bad, bad night   Its gonna be      A bad night   It's gonna be   A bad night   I guarantee   Tonight I'll have   A bad night   I know I shall      Maybe if the weather was just a little better   It might not have happened that way   But the situation was gettin' pretty bad, bad   A bad bad bad bad bad night it's gonna be      A bad night   It's gonna be   A bad night   I guarantee   Tonight I'll have   A bad night   I know I shall   I know I shall.And the candle dies..And send it to me, ah   Put it in a letter   If that'll make it better   And send it to me, haa   Stick it in a bottle   It's always getting hotter   Send it to me, haa   Nothing gonna stop it   So shoot it like a rocket   And send it to me, ahh      Deep in the night, I turn around   And wish you were here with me   I grab the sheets and make up a fantasy   Can't you see   That you're the one that I love?.Our songs, Our style   Our hair, Our smile   Our laughs, our heart   Our grace, our smarts      Lets get crazy..I can remember the very first time I cried   How I wiped my eyes and buried the pain inside   All of my memories - good and bad - that's past   Didn't even take the time to realize      Starin' at the cracks in the walls   'cause I'm waiting for it all to come to an end   Still I curl up right under the bed   'cause it's takin' over my head all over again      Do you even know who you are?.[Pre-chorus]   [Chorus]   Ohhohohohohoh!.When you've had enough..I like misty water,   I like fog and haze..Hey, take a listen   Tell me do you like what you hear?"
" There were many obstacles the builders had to take. One obstacle was the steel frame of the Empire State building would have to be modified because the dirigible's load and wind pressure would have been transmitted all the way to the buildings foundation. they had to pay ove sixty thousand dollars worth of modificautions in to the buildings framework..That I get a   Kick out of you      (Some like the perfume from Spain)   (I'm sure   That if I took even one sniff)   (It would bore me terrifically too)   (But I get a kick out of you)      (Some like the bop-type refrain)   (I'm sure that if   I heard even one riff)   (It would bore me terrifically too)   (But I get a kick out of you)      (Some they may go for cocaine)   (I'm sure that if   I took even one sniff)   (It would bore me   Terrifically too)   (But I get a kick out of you)      I get a kick every time   I see you   Standing there before me   I get a kick though   It's clear to see   You obviously do not adoreme      I get no kick in a plane   Flying too high   With some gal in the sky   Is my idea of nothing to do   But I get a kick out of you.Gonna cash my check before the drive-through closes   Get my baby a couple Quick-Sak roses   Put five dollars worth of gas in my pride and joy   Another Friday night in the life of a country boy   Gonna take her out to the Tasty-Freeze then   We'll go dancing at the American Legion   When ole Bobby does Elvis, you swear it was the real McCoy   Another Friday night in the life of a country boy   Aw there ain't much to do in the one-light town   But we don't let that slow us down   If it's too quiet, we make our own noise   Now you can bet your boots by the end of the week   My pretty little girl is ready for me   Another Friday night in the life of a country boy   When we've had enough of that shakin' and a shoutin'   We go fog up the windows in the Smoky Mountains   Have more fun than a couple of tourists and a Polaroid   Another Friday night in the life of a country boy   Aw there ain't much to do in the one-light town   But we don't let that slow us down   If it's too quiet, we make our own noise   Now you can bet your boots by the end of the week   My pretty little girl is ready for me   Another Friday night in the life of a country boy   Another Friday night in the life of a country boy.Great is Thy faithfulness   O God, my Father   There is no shadow of turning with Thee   Thou changest not   Thy compassion's they fail not   As Thou hast been,   Thou forever wilt be..I guess I'm just like a turtle   That's hidin' underneath it's horny shell..As someone once remarked to Schubert,   ""Take us to your Lieder""...

"When the idea of creating a moring post for dirigibles on top of the empire state building there were several problems engeneers failed to reconize. The first was the problem of using highly flamable hydrogen to fill the dirigibles. The Hindenburg accident showed how horible it is one one of these explodes. The situation would have been much worse had it been over @NUM1 stories in the air. Secondly violent wind gusts would have made it  imposible to dock the dirigible atop the building, especially when the use of custimary lead weights would be both unsafe and not pratical. Lastly there was a law imposed before this project was ever a thought making it unlawful to fly any airship that low to an urban area..Stabbed them all like that   I stab people I know, I stabbed Alex, my manager   He was like, ""WHAT THE FUCK?!"".(Jones, Capo)   Cash Money (Santana)   Dipset (Lil Weezy)   Let's Ride      'Cause real g's know the feeling (It's Murda)   It's hard body, no remorse for the killing (Watch It)   Cause real g's know the feeling (It's Murda)   It's hard body, no remorse for the killing (Weezy)      Mad trees and bitches in dungarees   The city under seas, kitchen 100 degrees   I love that summer breeze, I'll stand in it until it freeze   I'm from another breed, them sss, southern g's   I sip phemetrazine, I lean, I stand tall   I'm mean, I'm mad raw, I'm coming like fastball   Steee-rike, Yup, so get it right   Nigga, one of my sniplets'll end your whole life   You ain't nothing but a riblet to a nigga with a knife   In a fork, I'm a pig myself, I eat schwork   So be smart and play your own part   If you don't love yourself, I'll make you see your own heart   And we don't like the narcs, stay away from the cell   Hey, I'ma shoot it out if I'm facing the ail   Yea, so tell your girl to come and make me rich   Weezy Baby nigga, 9 to 5, 10 to 6      All night, I can't sleep, I toss and turn   Got my hand on my pistol, when will these motherfuckers learn?.But I guess your chances come but once and boy I sure missed mine..Are you playin' a game?.You spend every sentence as if it was marked currency!.Why are we running?.Went through the attic today   Found a note you wrote packed away..I haven't seen forever   Don't even know her name   I call on dreams and other schemes   To try and win that game   Now that it's over, darling   Look into my eyes   Seein' your own reflection   Much to your surprise   We're seein' mirror to mirror   Face to face   We look but we cannot see   Mirror to mirror   Seems to trace   What happened to you and me   And though we tried in earnest   The distant silence yells   We call on wings and other things   To try and break that spell   Now that it's over, darling   Truth in the common cause   We stare at our own indifference   By seeing the other's flaws   We're seein' mirror to mirror   Face to face   We look but we cannot see   Mirror to mirror   Seems to trace   What happened to you and me   Oh, mirror to mirror, mirror to mirror   Mirror to mirror, what's come over me   As we look inside, there's nowhere to turn   There's nowhere to hide   Now that it's over, darling   Look into my eyes   Seein' your own reflection   Much to your surprise   We're seein' mirror to mirror   Face to face   We look but we cannot see   Mirror to mirror   Seems to trace   What happened to you and me   Oh, mirror to mirror, mirror to mirror   Mirror to mirror, what's come over me   Mirror to mirror, mirror to mirror   Mirror to mirror, what's come over me.I'm wishing you a well...mind at peace within yourself..."

"There were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock. One of those obstacles was that there was a lack of suitable landing area in New York City. Another obstacle was that the architects couldn't drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof. A dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame. However, the greatest obstacle was nature. Wind on top of the building shift constantly caused by violent air currents. The back of the ship with swivel around the mooring mast while it was tethered..Oh..Long ago a young man sits   And plays his waiting game   But things are not the same it seems   As in such tender dreams      Slowly passing sailing ships   On sunday afternoon   Like the people on the moon I've seen   Are things not meant to be      Where do those golden rainbows end   (where do the rainbows end)   Why is this song so sad   (why is this song so sad)   Dreaming the dreams I dream my friend   (dreaming the dreams I dream)   Loving the love I love      To love is just a word I've heard   When things are being said   Stories my poor head has told me   Can not stand the cold      And in between what might have been   And what has come to pass   Are misbegotten guests alas   And bits of broken glass      Where do your golden rainbows end   (where do the rainbows end)   Why is the song I sing so sad   (why is this song so sad)   Dreaming the dreams I dream my friend   (dreaming the dreams I dream)   Loving the love I love   To love to love to love      Where do your golden rainbows end   (where do the rainbows end)   Why is the song I sing so sad   (why is this song so sad)   Dreaming the dreams I dream my friend   (dreaming the dreams I dream)   Loving the love I love   To love to love to love   Whoa no no no no no.You ain't gotta spend no money,   Just a little time with me honey,   That will let me know you love me so..Ugh!.What if the world was crazy and I was sane   Would it be so strange   I can't believe that I am alone in saying   The things I'm saying   I am a part of you      These are universal truths   We're all part of the light that flows through everything   This is a different kind of love song   Dedicated to everyone   Different kind of love song-oh,oh   What if the world calmed down and we could all breath   Together easily   Connecting the sky and the ground with you and me   And everything in between   I am part of you      We have living proof   There is some kind of light that flows through everything   This is a different kind of love song   Dedicated to everyone   Different kind of love song-oh,oh   This is a different kind of love song   A higher plane we can flow on   Different kind of love song-oh,oh.But it's gone on for too long   I know how much it hurts to hear   You show it and I know it   So there's no reason for the tears..I'll have to accept that you're not coming back   No, no more, no more, no more, no more...

"The builder's of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the mast. For example, when the builder's decided to construct the mast they knew that it could not just be placed on the roof. It had to be somehow attatched to the foundation of the building because the dirigible, ""would add stress to the building's frame."" Also, after the Hindenburg disaster the builders realized that the hydrogen inside the dirigible ""is highly flammable."" If a dirigible were to explode over New York City it would not only kill the people in the dirigible, but on the ground as well. Finally, the biggest obstacle of the mooring mast ""was nature itself."" The wind at the top of the building are very strong and would have swiveled around the mast. The many obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building never allowed any dirigibles to land there..My cryin's through, I'm moving on..Everytime from the 1st day of December to the 25th The time goes so slow The excitement takes over, the presents and cards, Advant calenders prepared to be opened, the special moments ooh   chorus: ooh the count down is always the best, as advant calenders are waiting to lead the way, the chocolates for everyone ooh the count down ooh yey yeah the count down to christmas!.Church bells will chime,   And they will know you are mine..Don't you want me, oh   Don't you want me, baby?.I'll wait."".Have you seen me when I didn't see you?.Never meant to hurt you, I don't know why   You come with your lawyers and your alibi   How can you look me straight in the eye   When you know      The clock on the wall is singing our song   The love in my heart is all dead and gone   You know why   You know why      There you go with your confidence trick   I'm much too wise, you don't fool me a bit   Feeling so low and looking so high   We both know that your truth is a lie      I never really knew you all these years   You lied to my face while I undressed your fears   Then you set me a-sail on an ocean of tears   Said goodbye      The clock on the wall is ticking real slow   There's nothing to say and there's nowhere to go   You know why   You know why      There, there you go with your confidence trick   I'm much too wise, you don't fool me a bit, no no   Feeling so low and looking so high   We both know that your truth is a lie      It's a lie      Looking up to the truth of what you are   Blinding all colours and beauty   And the sparkle in your eye is blinding      The clock on the wall is singing our song   The love in my heart is all dead and gone   You know why   You know why   Why, why, why, why, why, why      There, there you go with your confidence trick   I'm much too wise, you don't fool me a bit   Feeling so low and looking so high   We both know that your truth is a lie   It's a lie, lie      [Repeats]   (The truth is, the truth is a lie)      And you never stopped loving me   Choking back tears for you   So lovable   And we never go   And we never know   See I'm over   But I'm under   I don't ever wanna come down   I don't ever wanna come down   I don't ever wanna come down   To where you are.Is That what you really want?.I said I'm goin' on down to Brownsville   Gonna take, take, take your ride and roll,   Whoa, if you see me my baby, comin', oh, come on, comin' home,   Alright!"
"The builders of the Empire State Building were challenged the obstacles of construction, safety, and nature that did not allow dirigibles to dock there. These dirigibles or blimps were large balloons that were capable of carrying passengers but needed a great landing area. In order for dirigibles to be used as transportation, architects needed to design a suitable mooring mast. However, the weight and pressure of a blimp on a mast would cause a large amount of stress to the building's frame. The builders of the Empire State building were faced with producing ""over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications"" to the building's framework. Not only was attempting blimps to dock there a lot of work and very costly, builders were challenge with safety issues. As experienced to the German blimp ""Hindenburg,"" dirigibles that use hydrogen are ""highly flammable."" If any incident occurred over the Empire State building in New York, involving a dirigible, it would affect the enormous population in the area by killing so many lives. Flying too low over the city was another challenge to safety that a law would make illegal and unsuccessful for blimps to be used. Lastly, nature was an obstacle the builders faced in docking dirigibles. At mast times, the ""forceful winds"" would cause the back of the ship swivel which could lead to it hitting the sharp spires and be punctured. Lead weights were also not safe when dangling over pedestrians. These obstacles made it difficult to create gear that would allow dirigibles to dock on the building..(Did you ever think)   Did you ever think we'd all believe the hype?.Can't tell you the truth   'Least I don't lie about that   Kind of comfort in you   Comes when you lie right back      Safe from such a strange point of view   To hear your own words on you      How much do you go to be gone?.Merry Christmas Everybody..Should have been there..Ever homeward, ever homeward, yearns the weary rover..One good ride from start to end   I'd like to take that ride again, again!.Lazy days calling to you   Come out to play   The future lies with you   Now you can be sure love is the cure   What we're searching for   Is to have a jolly good time      Crazy days but you'll get me through   And here I'll stay holding on to you   Now you can be sure   Our thoughts unpure   Will unlock the door   And we will have a jolly good time      It can happen in any season   We don't need any reason   To sit around and wait   The world can change in a second so   I find the sunshine beckons me   To open up the gate   And dream and dream      Lazy days don't let them get you down   Wear your smile   I don't want to see you frown   Don't let them get you down      It can happen in any season   We don't need any reason   To sit around and wait   The world can change in a second so   I find the sunshine beckons me   To open up the gate   And dream and dream      Then we will have - a jolly good time.They're messin' with me, Come on, come on, come on..It was getting dark in a snow-covered park   I thought I saw you smiling   You left town to marry a Texas millionaire   I wonder how you are doing      You were a New York woman   New York woman   New York woman   I love you      I heard him on the air discussing world affairs   And something about his global vision   That's when I wondered if you made the right decision   I want to know what you're thinking      You were a New York woman   New York woman   New York woman   I miss you      You were a New York woman   New York woman   New York woman   I miss you      I miss you, I miss you, I miss you   I miss you, my friend      I miss you   Oh, I miss you   Oh, I miss you   Oh, I miss you"
"During the times of the Empire State Building and it's claim to fame with height, it's @CAPS1 Al Smith, faced more than one obstacle with accomplishing the mooring mast's completion. From the very beginning of it's construction, the mooring mast was not properly thought out and did not have the proper design. Al Smith realized this even before he finalized the process of building. Once he finally did complete the mooring mast, he faced obstacles. The dirigibles had problems with docking, due to the wind and the elements, the dirigibles had a hard time staying stationary once docked. Another obstacle was fuel, due to the recent Hindenburg crash, dirigibles needed to be fueled with helium rather than the more flammable hydrogen. Finally, the laws that were in place about airships not being allowed to fly low over urban areas caused the mooring mast to fail. Eventually airplanes took the dirigibles position and the mooring mast was retired. Due to these obstacles, Al Smith gave up with the mooring mast but still helped the record for the highest building..Look at you now, look at you now,   you're put in your place, put in your place oh,   all medicine, all medicine is smacked in the face,   smacked in the face again!.The world's sweetest lady   Live around my way   And I think that I'm in love   Hey there sweet one   You don't know what you've done   I was once so lonely   Now I only think of love, of love sweet love   And you're the sweetest one      [Chorus I:]   (The sweetest one) I've ever known   (Sugar and honey) You're the one   (You are the one) The sweetest love   (The sweetest one and only)      Said I'm in love forever   With the sweetest lady   And I know she love me too      Hey there sweetness   Girl, believe me you're the best   You are quite amazing   I'll forever stay in love, in love sweet love   'Cause you're the sweetest one      [Chorus II:]   (The sweetest one) I have known   (I've ever known) Everyone   (Everyone) Says it's love   (Says we belong together) Yeah   (The sweetest one) The sweetest love   (Sugar and honey) You're the one   (You are the one) And I'm in love   (The sweetest one and only) Yeah      Hey there sweetie pie   People never ask me why   'Cause it's so easy to see   Why I'm so sweetly in love, in love sweet love   And you're the sweetest one.My hands are red   Admittedly, the cross is mine   The time is come   Forsake the brine   Alone with the void for a thousand years   I am the first of the reptillian rocketeers   Doom shins it's bitter brink   Its goblins casting stench to pave the way   I'm going off to seek the soul   Who'll teach me of the day   A boy will be born in the garden   I'll wait on a patch of green grass   Somehow he'll know to find me there   And place a star upon my crust   We'll trace the crescent's rim   Pawn's pursuit of deliverance   My soul a satchel for musical vim   Then I'll return to save my race.And when you come I promise   To be your very own!.And if I have to crawl upon the floor..She's him, too..I'm cleaning, I'm cleaning again..(I will see it no more.).I tried but I can't find you   Tell me now what do I do   I tried but I can't find you   Tell me now what do I do."

"Based on the article The Mooring Mast, the builders of the Empire State Building faced challenges in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there, such as the lack of landing area, being practical, and ensuring safety. The lack of landing area was of the the challenges. ""The one obstacle to their expanded use in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area"". Since no dirigible could land on the Empire State Building without some fish and landing space this was a challenge the builders of the building faced. Another challenge was making the dock practical, ""one set of engineers here in New York is trying to dope out a practical, workable arrangement.."". This shows that a practical arrangement of the talking has yet been made, and therefore it was another challenge the builders faced. Lastly, the builders of the Empire State Building faced safety issues, "".... are figuring on some safe way of mooring airships to this mast""-this informs that the safety of docking dirigibles has not been unsured yet, that it was still a challenge the builders faced area altogether, the builders of the Empire State Building faced challenges such as the lack of landing areas, being practical, and ensuring safety..Beat out the black and white   Place I could meet you by   A place on the other side   I'll let you know when I go   When I'm gone      It's not me   Buried wreckage my soul   It's not me so who am I now?.Come on, come on now,   Yeah!.The hardest thing in the world      Holland it don't please   I never wanted to leave   Searching for a perfect day   It never happens that way   Ahey hey hey      I'm sick and tired   It's so obscene   Will heaven help me be clean?.Why ain't we livin',livin' together instead of being so so far apart   Why ain't we livin',livin' together instead of being so so far apart   Why ain't we livin' together, livin' together instead of bein' alone   Why ain't we livin' together, livin' together instead of bein' alone      I lay my heart on you and you can show the way   I give my everlasting love until my dying day   Take this lonely soul , the water or the wine   A chance to make you mine   I lay my body on the line      Why ain't we livin', livin' together instead of bein' so so far apart   Why ain't we livin', livin' together instead of bein' so so far apart   Why ain't we livin' together ,livin' together instead of bein' alone   Why ain't we livin' together ,livin' together instead of bein' alone      My life was emptiness until you came along   I nearly fell apart , you took my heart and made me strong   I need all of you to get me through the night   A chance to see the light   I lay my body on the line      Why ain't we livin',livin' together instead of bein' so so far apart   Why ain't we livin',livin' together instead of bein' so so far apart   Why ain't we livin' together instead of bein' alone   Why ain't we livin' together instead of bein' alone      Why ain't we livin', livin' together instead of being so so far apart   Why ain't we livin', livin' together instead of being so so far apart   Why ain't we livin' together , livin' together instead of bein' alone   Why ain't we livin' together, livin' together instead of bein' alone      Why ain't we livin' livin' together instead of bein' so so far apart   Why ain't we livin' livin' together instead of bein so so far apart   Why ain't we livin' livin' together instead of bein' so so far apart(fade).Oh well, I don't wanna be a soldier mama, I don't wanna die   Well, I don't wanna be a sailor mama, I don't wanna fly   Well, I don't wanna be a failure mama, I don't wanna cry   Well, I don't wanna be a soldier mama, I don't wanna die   Oh no, oh no, oh no, oh no, oh no.THAT'S IT!.Builds within my body..Get the bow going!.Waters all over these pages."
"In the excerpt of ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION2, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles when trying to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle that prevented the docking of dirigibles at the Empire State Building was the use of Hydrogen rather than helium in dirigibles from out of the United States. This was a problem because hydrogen is very flammable. When the german dirigible was destroyed in New Jersey the architects of the Empire State Building realized how dangerous it was. Another obstacle faced by the builders was the weather. The weather affected the use of the mooring mast because ""The winds on the top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" A practical reason why the mooring mast could not dock dirigibles At the Empire State Building was because of the law against airships. The law said that airships could not fly too low over urban areas making it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to a building. These are a Few of the many obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building which prevented the use of the mooring mast..There's a hurt in me I don't understand   What have I done?.Sp00l   Turn another turn!.Thenardier   You will have a job to catch him   He's the one you should arrest   No more bourgeois when you scratch him   Than that brand upon his chest!.Chorus   It's ok sometimes to whisper   But hey, listen to me mister   The way we act can anybody tell?.that's great   Two legs ain't bad   Unless there's a crate   They ship the parts   To mama in   For souvenirs: two ears (get down!).I called you today   Wanting a change   I never meant to hurt anyone   Never meant for you to pull out your guns   But feelings won't stay   In this meager parade   You're beating to a different drum   In this lack of all the luster we've become      Save your breath   You know we've both   Tried our best   But it's leaving      This might as well be done   I'm falling with the sun   When the hours getting sour won't save with time   I'm waving off the one   Who wouldn't let me run   Though we tried, it's a lie I can't keep dragging on   I'm untying this sinking stone      Don't sit on the fence   Living past tense   Holding on to wishes and words   Folding out a picture we blur   'Cause here in the end   I'm losing a friend   Fighting back a tear when it burns   Dividing up the pieces that we were      Save your breath   You know we've both   Tried our best   But it's leaving      This might as well be done   I'm falling with the sun   When the hours getting sour won't save with time   I'm waving off the one   Who wouldn't let me run   Though we tried, it's a lie I can't keep dragging on   I'm untying this sinking stone      I can't say you're all alone   I'm accepting what I own   Here lies a blanket and not a bandage      I'm unable to restrain   When the wake that we became   Is drawing me under      This might as well be done   I'm falling with the sun   When the hours getting sour won't save with time   I'm waving off the one   Who wouldn't let me run   Though we tried, it's a lie I can't keep dragging on      This might as well be done   I'm falling with the sun   When the hours getting sour won't save with time   I'm waving off the one   Who wouldn't let me run   Though we tried, it's a lie I can't keep dragging on   I'm untying this sinking stone...Here I am   Shooting for the sky   You say youve settled in   Yeah well I guess thats good for you   But Im still trying to tear myself free   Well I could take it or leave it   You know thats what Ive said to myself   But then I start to tremble   And Im lost to a powerless cause      Im losing touch   Sometimes my memories   They just seem to fade fast away   Ive been losing too much   Losing the feel for the dreams I once thought I had   Sometimes I feel like theyre all circling around   They keep calling to me and I keep falling down   Id rather be alone and lonely lying on the ground   Than in those grips again      Theyre so cruel   Taught me to fly   Then they stole my sky   Taught me to love   Then they broke me down   Till there was nothing left but emptiness   And dont you ever feel like theyre all circling around   They keep calling to me and I keep falling down   Id rather be alone and lonely lying on that ground   Than in those grips again      Well I could take it I could leave it you know hah   Thats what Ive said to myself   Ive been down there so many times you know   And it hurts like nothing else   Cause Im losing touch   Ive been slipping away   Ive been losing too much.Good Christian, fear, for sinners here   The silent Word is pleading."
"In theory, the idea of creating a mooring mast on the top of the Empire State building was a great idea. However in reality, it didn't turn out so well. There are many reasons why a dirgible could not be docked to the Empire State Building. For example: ""Most dirgibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen instead of Helium"" (paragraph @NUM1) This was dangerous because hydrogen is extremely flammable, and if for some reason an accident occurred, it could be catastrophic over a densely populated city like New York. Possibly the most dangerous obstacle was the climate around the Empire State Building. There is a constant powerful wind that shifts a lot due to all the different air currents the building creates. If a dirigible docked there, it would be blowing all over the place, if it could even dock at all. Most dirigibles that were moored in open fields were weighted down with lead weights in the back, but this would be too dangerous to try over a city teeming with people. Lastly, there ""was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas... this would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area.""

"The mooring mast of the Empire State Building was destined to never fulfill its purpose. In the short excerpt of ""The Mooring Mast by @ORGANIZATION2, many obstacles were clearly stated to why the mast was not a good idea. The building of the mast was rushed. Al Smith had realized that he was close to losing the title of the worlds tallest building and quickly put the mast to mind. Problems quickly arose The first problem that had arose was the lack of a suitable landing area. Al Smith stated that passengers could safely swing in the breeze. This problem was ignored and soon other problems arose as the building of the mast continued. The greatest problem that should have been thought about before building the mast was nature itself The winds were horrible at the height of the building and architects soon realized that landing would be a major issue. The mast was still questioned and architects and engineers were doing all they could to make it work until something was brought upon them, a law. It is illegal for airships to fly too low over an urban area. The law that was realized marked the end of Al Smith's idea and by the late 1930's, the idea of using the mooring mast for dirigibles and their passengers have quietly disappeared..Are the type to leave them all hanging, and run like a bitch?.As he confirms what Fermat   Jotted down in that margin,   Which could've used some enlargin'..A.1..The plans already in motion,   it happens whether we say..Too many stars!.That you should care for me!.Non dimenticar means   Don't forget you are my darling   Don't forget to be   All you mean to me   Non dimenticar, my love   Is like a star, my darling   Shining bright and clear   Just because you're here      Please do not forget   That our lips have met   And I've held you tight, dear   Was it dreams ago   My heart felt this glow?.Roll, roll, roll brother trucker,   Get back on your wheels again..Just strap me in   Behind the wheel   And bury me with   My automobile."
"The obstacles that builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock had some consequences. One of the obstacles to there expanded use in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area. Also, the Architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire state buildings flat roof because a thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the buildings frame. The greatest obstacle to successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself. The winds on the top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. The last obstacle why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. The U.S. Navy dirigible Los Angeles approached the mooring mast but could not get close enough to tie up because of forceful winds.And what have they done?.[Big Boi]   Well here's a formal introduction   Something to make you ponder   The situation's ugly, like ""In Living Color""'s Wanda (word up!).All the lies we were told,   All the lies of the people running round,   They're castles have burned..What have I, what have I, what have I done to deserve this?.(Didn't he do it, well didn't he?).Everything about us looks wrong but I swear it feels right..How can you sleep here?.Why did you grieve me?.How did you know?"
"The main obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there stemmed from the bad location. The dirigibles would be docking 1,250 feet above one of the busiest cities in the world. This would create three problems for the docking of the dirigibles. The first problem is hydrogen is what was used in dirigibles and it is extremely flammable. If a dirigible were to explode above downtown New York many people would be killed. This means not many people are going to want the dirigibles docking there. If the Empire State Building had not been above such a densely populated area they may have not had this problem. The next difficulty would be the fact that at that altitude in New York City there are violent wind currents that are always changing. This makes it hard for the conductors to dock the dirigible and it also could possibly cause the dirigible to hit something and pop. So again the dirigible is falling into downtown New York and killing many people. This is another reason it was a bad location. It needed to be in a place where there were more stable wind currents. The final obstacle was there was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This meant that even if the other to factor disappear there was a law the builders should have known about that forbade their plans. Like the author said the Empire State Building was destined to never fulfill its purpose..Well, now, times got hard   And I didn't draw the card I needed   So, I proceeded to bang it on down the line   Hitchhike, turnpike   And if you got room, won't you let me ride?.Friday night butterflies   Like clockwork they'd arrive   A little chill and the October sky   Nervous till the kickoff game   4 quarters win or lose   Spent Saturdays black and blue   But it was what I love to do   And it was more than just a game      It was my life and it was fun   Another season of my life is done   Another race I'm glad I got to run   Another chapter of my life it's over   No I'm never gonna feel like that again   Times rushin by me like the wind   Never be as young as I was then   No I'm never gonna feel like that again      Practice dancin in my garage   Two left feet and a white corsage   Daddy let me borrow the dodge   Said don't bring her home on empty   Swung by and picked up Cindy Lou   Took her to the prom for a dance or two   Then we drove down to the water blue and that's where she kissed me      It was my life and it was fun   Another season of my life is done   Another race i'm glad I got to run   Another chapter of my life it's over   No i'm never gonna feel like that again   Times rushin by me like the wind   Never be as young as I was then   No i'm never gonna feel like that again      I got a call one July day   Cindy Lou was in that way   Had a big decision to make   And I couldn't take it lightly   At first I thought of leavin town   But I couldn't let our families down   Now I'm out here throwin this ball around   With a boy that looks just likes me      Its my life and it's sure fun   Another season of my lifes begun   Another race I'm glad I get to run   Another chapter of my life I'm writin   No I'm never gonna feel like this again   Times rushin by me like the wind   Got to grab each moment that I can   Cuz I'm never gonna feel like this again   No I'm never gonna feel like this again   Nooooooooo I'm never gonna feel like this again.Dance to the beat   Of the living dead   Lose sleep baby   And stay away from bed   Raw power is sure to come   A runnin' to you   If you're alone   And you got the shakes   So am I baby   And I got what it takes   Raw power will surely come   Running to you   Raw power got a healin' hand   Raw power can destroy a man   Raw power is more than soul   It's got a son called rock and roll   Raw power honey just won't quit   Raw power I can feel it   Raw power baby can't be beat   Poppin' eyes and flashin' feet   Everybody's always tryin to tell me   What to do   Don't you try   Don 't you try to tell me what to do   Look in the eye   Of the savage girl   Fall deep in love   In the underworld   Raw power is sure to come   Runnin' to you   If you're alone   And you got the fear   So am I baby   Let's move on out of here   Raw power is sure to come   A runnin' to you   Raw power got a magic touch   Raw power is much too much   Happiness is guaranteed   It was made for you and me   Raw power honey just won't quit   Raw power I can feel it   Raw power honey can't be beat   Get down and kiss my feet   Raw power's got no place to go   Raw power honey it don't want to know   Raw power is a guaranteed OD   Raw power is laughin' at you and me   And this is what I want to know   Can you feel it?.Two hearts, born to run   Who'll be the lonely one?.can't see how I can   Turn around what has been done   I was just like a child   With my eyes wide open      History and any cause   And my eyes are still open   But my mouth my mouth is shut   I'm closing off the lies      Making my own mind up   When I can I will   How many dirty little secrets   Were kept behind my back?.Leave you here, never let you down..I don't want to be lonely tonight..Baby, I Love You - It's True      Oh, Baby - Don't Let Me Down   Oh, Baby - Don't Fool Around   Oh, Baby Don't Stop - My Love Is Hot   Take Me, Oh Take Me Tonight.....

"The builders of the Empire State Building faced multiple obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. If they were to succeed, they would have become a major aviation accommidation for transatlantic routes and new routes that were yet to come. In order to allow dirigibles to dock at the top of the building, the mooring mast needed to be constructed and put on to the top of the building. Simply adding the masts to the building was no easily reached task. The Empire State Building's frame needed to be modified so it could withstand the stress from the dirigible mounted onto the mooring mast. Over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications were made to adjust the building's framework. Once the framework was adjusted, architects designed a shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel tower that was illuminated from the inside. This tower served as a mast for the building to come. Before the mooring mast could be constructed, the roof of the building had to be completed. Once the roof was constructed, the mooring mast was added with its own skeleton of steel. Once the entire project was finished, the owners of the Empire State Building realized that docking dirigibles would be much too dangerous. After all the rigorous work put into the mooring mast was completed, it became clear that it would never be used for its original purpose..Some are wise,   Some are strong,   Some are everything   You could dream of..But the land was already claimed by a people   When the cowboy came and when the soldiers came   The story of the American Indian is in a lot of ways   A story of tragedy, like that day at Wounded Knee, South Dakota   Big Foot was an Indian chief   Of the Minneconjou band   A band of Minneconjou Sioux   From South Dakota land   Big Foot said to Custer   ""Stay away from Crazy Horse""   But Custer crossed into Sioux land   And he never came back across   Then Big Foot led his people   To a place called Wounded Knee   And they found themselves surrounded   By the 7th Cavalry   Big chief Big Foot   Rise up from your bed   Minneconjou babies cry   For their mothers lying dead   Big Foot was down with a fever   When he reached Wounded Knee   And his people all were prisoners   Of the 7th Cavalry   Two hundred women and children   And another hundred men   Raised up a white flag of peace   But peace did not begin   An accidental gunshot   And Big Foot was first to die   And over the noise of the rifles   You could hear the babies cry   Big chief Big Foot   It's good that you can't see   Revenge is being wrought   By Custer's 7th Cavalry   Then smoke hung over the canyon   On that cold December day   All was death and dying   Around where Big Foot lay   Farther on up the canyon   Some had tried to run and hide   But death showed no favorites   Women, men, and children died   One side called it a massacre   The other a victory   But the white flag is still waving   Today at Wounded Knee   Big chief Big Foot   Your Minneconjou band   Is more than remembered here   In South Dakota land.Don't you try..Je n'ai jamais avant   Aimee un enfant   Sans controle..I wasn't born in the morning, no   I must have been born in the night   I've done my load and I'll carry my load   And all I own is my life      I wasn't born to be lucky,   Cause luck had no future with me   I've done my wrong and I'll sing, sing, sing my song   and stand beneath the hanging tree      Bury me down by the river   Let all the towns people see   Their enemy's dead, let me lay, lay my head   Just put me down and set me free      I wasn't born as a rich man, no   A rich man I never, I never could be   I've done my wrong and I'll sing, sing, sing my song   And stand beneath the hanging tree (Everybody sing now)      Bury me down by the river, lord no   Let all the towns people see, see   Their enemy's dead, let me lay, lay, lay my head   Just put me down and set me free   (I want to hear everybody sing)      Bury me down by the river   Let all the towns, let all the towns people see   Their enemy's dead, let me lay, let met lay, let me lay my head along   Just put me down and set me free (set me free).Anything   Catch a kangaroo?.Cause at the end of the day,   Aren't we all just boys and girls?.Mighty Hogweed is avenged..With the price of oil,   The war of the spoils."
"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The first obstacle they had to overcome was that if a dirigibles, which could reach up to a thousand feet in length, was moored to the tops of the building it would add stress to the building's frame. This meant the steel frame of the building had to be strengthened and modified to deal with the added stress. The cost of the modifications was over sixty thousand dollars. The next challenge was discovered after the building was finished. This was the fact that having dirigibles moor at the Empire State Building was unsafe. This first reason why it is unsafe is that most dirigibles, not from the United States, used hydrogen into helium and hydrogen is highly flammable. This meant an accident like that of the Hindenburg could happen above the highly populated downtown area of New York. Another problem that arose after the construction was that the shifting winds on top of the building were too violent for the dirigible, which would swivel around the mooring mast. All these challenges along with an existing law they did not allow airships to fly too low over urban areas were the obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building and is why only one dirigible was ever moored there..the Rockies, nestled in the trees,   I fell in love with Lake Louise   smiling with her sparkling emerald eyes   Soon we'll reach the sea   and there I'll stand   With nothing but the blue between me and japan   Now I'm at the end of the line,   Out of track, out of time,   Conductor makes his final round   All the people and places past   They went by just a little too fast   How I wishI could've slowed this engine down..Close every door to me,   Hide all the world from me   Bar all the windows   And shut out the light   Do what you want with me,   Hate me and laugh at me   Darken my daytime   And toture my night      If my life were important I   Would ask will I live or die   But I know the answers lie   Far from this world      Just give me a number   Instead of my name   Forget all about me   And let me decay   I do not matter,   I'm only one person   Destroy me completely   Then throw me away      If my life were important I   Would ask will I live or die   But I know the answers lie   Far from this world      Close every door to me,   Keep those I love from me   Children of Israel   Are never alone      For we know we shall find   Our own peace of mind   For I have been promised   A land of   A land of our own!.She holds back, at first, but as this duet ends, they sing together for the first time, and their first word is ""Love."".I see astray   I pick up a furious pace so I can get away   Don't smile a purple pleasure hangs the cape   Oh Me, Oh My, It was the great escape   The situation, it's still to me a bit of a scandal   Every time I see a purple smile within my underwear..But she's a woman to me   On fire now I'm on fire now   On fire now I'm on fire now   All over all over   On fire now I'm on fire now   All over all over   I'm on fire now I'm on fire now I'm on fire now   I'm on fire fire all over   Ah baby on fire now.How do you say it, I just don't know   When it comes to leaving you're on your own   How do you tell someone you're letting go?.Well I woke up this morning   On the wrong side of the bed   And how I got to thinkin'   About all those things you said   About ordinary people   And how they make you sick   And if callin' names kicks back on you   Then I hope this does the trick   'cause I'm sick of your complainin'   About how many bills   And I'm sick of all your bitchin'   'Bout your poodles and your pills   And I just can't see no humor   About your way of life   And I think I can do more for you   With this here fork and knife   Eat the rich   There's only one thing that they are good for   Eat the rich   Take one bite now - come back for more   Eat the rich   I gotta get this off my chest   Eat the rich   Take one bite now - spit out the rest   So I called up my head shrinker   And I told him what I'd done   He said you best go on a diet   Yeah, I hope you have some fun   And a don't go burst the bubble   On rich folks who get rude   'Cause you won't get in no trouble   When you eats that kinda food   Now they're smokin' up their junk bonds   And then they go get stiff   And they're dancin' in the yacht club   With muff and uncle biff   But there's one good thing that happens   When you toss your pearls to swine   Their attitudes may taste like shit   But go real good with wine   Eat the rich   There's only one thing that they are good for   Eat the rich   Take one bite now - come back for more   Eat the rich   I gotta get this off my chest   Eat the rich   Take one bite now - spit out the rest   Believe in all the good things   That money just can't buy   Then you won't get no bellyache   From eatin' humble pie   I believe in rags to riches   Your inheritance won't last   So take your gray poupon my friend   And shove it up your ass   Eat the rich   There's only one thing that they are good for   Eat the rich   Take one bite now - come back for more   Eat the rich   I gotta get this off my chest   Eat the rich   Take one bite now - spit out the rest   Eat the rich   There's only one thing that they are good for   Eat the rich   Take one bite now - come back for more   Eat the rich   Don't stop me now, I'm goin' crazy   Eat the rich   That's my idea of a good time baby.He wants to dream like a young man   With the wisdom of an old man..Oh boatman, taker and giver,   Can you deliver me?"
"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles when they attempted to allow dirigibles (blimps) to dock there. The greatest obsticle was nature itself. With violent changing winds and climate, it made it extremely hard to tie dirigibles down to the mooring mast. The other main reason why dirigibles could not moor on the Empire State Building was the existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. The dirigibles will never be tied down to the moor because it would break the law. Safety was also a big reason why the dirigibles could not be tied down to the moor. Dirigibles outside of the @LOCATION2 used hydrogen rather than helium to fill their dirigibles. The hydrogen is very flammable so people feared if it were to catch fire over a busy city like New York, all hell would let loose. These were a few examples of the struggles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building..I only wanna get up there   A bad bitch rollin' up some good   Light it up and hand me it   All I wanna do, trouble up   Extendo doubled up   Tired as fuck ain't no more work   Ease my mind, that's where it hurt   Pull up in somethin' that go skrrt   Fishtailin' like we Dirk   Feel like Ray J for the purp   Come and let me hit it first   I'ma pass it if it's some gas   I'ma pull up, might forget to ask   Smokin' Ivory, passin' plenty tabs   Roll the 'Wood up so it can last      [Chorus: Starrah]   Blunt after blunt after blunt after blunt   After blunt after blunt after, hey   Cup after cup, gotta double that up   I've been waitin' on this all day   Nigga pass that shit, yeah   Nigga pass that shit   Bunt after blunt after blunt after blunt   After blunt after blunt after, hey   Cup after cup, gotta double that up   I've been waitin' on this all day   Nigga pass that shit   Nigga pass that shit   Nigga pass that shit, yeah   Nigga pass that shit.And me I run Toronto holla at me when you done laps..that was hazy cosmic jive      There's a starman waiting in the sky   He'd like to come and meet us   But he thinks he'd blow our minds   There's a starman waiting in the sky   He's told us not to blow it   'Cause he knows it's all worthwhile   He told me   Let the children lose it   Let the children use it   Let all the children boogie      I had to phone someone so I picked on you   Hey, that's far out so you heard him too!.Please don'tcha do it to me baby,   Either take the love I offer   Or let me be..I've lost her now for sure,   I won't see her no more,   It's gonna be a drag...Misery!.Suicide machine   A request to die with dignity   Is that too much to ask?.I'm on a diet but I'm doing donuts in a six speed   M M M6 from a M-2   I see a lot of rap bitches on a menu   But I collect 100 thou at the venue   And pop bottles with the team young money til the death of me      I'm about whatever man..Here I am playing with those memories again   And just when I thought time had set me free   Those thoughts of you keep taunting me      Holding you, a feeling I never outgrew   Though each and every part of me has tried   Only you can fill that space inside      So there's no sense pretending   My heart it's not mending      Just when I thought I was over you   And just when I thought I could stand on my own   Oh, baby those memories come crashing through   And I just can't go on without you      On my own I've tried to make the best of it alone   I've done everything I can to ease the pain   But only you can stop the rain      I just can't live without you   I miss everything about you      Just when I thought I was over you   And just when I thought I could stand on my own   Oh baby those memories come crashing through   And I just can't go on without   Go on without   It's just no good without you      Without you, without you, without you   Oh baby, those memories come crashing through   And I just can't go on without, you.There must have been millions   in the world she'd rather see   At least in my mind   as time has gone by   it's always harder to laugh then to cry      Where do I begin today?"

"In a desperate attempt to revolutionize the way people traveled, the idea of the mooring was not thought over as well as it should have been. The number of problems and obstacles mounted higher and higher with the idea of mooring airships to a new mast atop the Empire State Building. One of these main obstacles was, while an airship was tethered to the building it would add stress, ""The stress of dirigibles load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation"". Another obstacle faced with the mooring mast was one of safety. Dirigibles not from the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, which is Highly flammable. Another obstacle to the construction was nature itself, with high, shifting winds due to violent air currents, a dirigible tethered to the mast would swivel around and around the Empire State Building, the only way to prevent this would be to tie the lead weights to the rear end, but massive dangling weights, hanging over one thousand feet above the public, was not the safest idea. A last obstacle that was faced with the fact that there was an existing law that prevented airships from flying too low over urban areas. These were all obstacles that should have been thought through and realized before construction for the Empire State building's mooring mast ever begin..Preacher?.Will ou sleep tonight or will you think of me   Will I shake this off   Pretend it's all okay that there's someone out there who feels just like me   There is.[Chorus]   Tell the angels no, I don't want to leave my baby alone   I don't want nobody else to hold you   That's a chance I'll take   Baby I'll stay, Heaven can wait   No, if the angels took me from this earth   I would tell them bring me back to her   It's a chance I'll take, maybe I'll stay   Heaven can wait      You're beautiful   Each moment spent with you is simply wonderful   This love I have for you girl it's incredible   And I don't know hat I'd do, if I can't be with you   The world could not go on so every night I pray   If the Lord should come for me before I wake   I wouldn't want to go if I can't see your face, can't hold you close   What good would Heaven be   If the angels came for me I'd tell them no      [Chorus]      Unthinkable   Me sitting up in the clouds and you are all alone   The time might come around when you'd be moving on   I'd turn it all around and try to get back down to my baby girl   Can't stand to see nobody kissing, touching her   Couldn't take nobody loving you the way we were   What good would Heaven be   If the angels come for me I'd tell them no      [Chorus]      Oh no, can't be without my baby   Won't go, without her I'd go crazy   Oh no, guess Heaven will be waiting   Ooh   Oh no, can't be without my baby   Won't go, without her I'd go crazy   Oh no, guess Heaven will be waiting   Ooh      [Chorus]      Just leave us alone, leave us alone   Please leave us alone.Story's done it's just history..Holding on just breaks me, worry,   Got to let it go..Once upon a time   Not so long ago   People used to stand and stare   At the spider with the platinum hair   They thought you were immortal      We had our ups and downs   Like brothers often do   But I was there for him   He was always there for me   And we were there for you      How can I put into words   What my heart feels?.Think about it what cha gonna tell your boss?.Can you shake the dust from off my shoes -   Take away these bad weather blues?.Lie down in your bed, your bed of lies   And I knew better, than to look in your eyes   They only pretend, you will be mine   And you know how you made me, believe   You had me caught in every web, that you weaved   But do you ever think of me, when you lie?"
"There were many obstacles that the builders of the empire state building had to face. One obstacle being constructing a strong enough frame for the building so that a thousand foot derigible could be held by the single tether cable. Another obstacle that builders of the empire state building faced was safety how most derigibles from outside the U.S at the time used hydrogen rather than helium, which made it very dangerous since hydrogen is very flammable.

"In an attempt to allow dirigibles, otherwise known as zeppelins or blimps to dock on the Empire State Building, the builders faced many obstacles along the way. Al Smith stated ""... engineers here in New York [are] trying to dope out a practical, workable arrangement"" (paragraph @NUM1). First, they would not drop a mooring mast on top of the building's flat roof. This would add too much stress to the frame and it would have to be modified to accommodate this new situation"" (paragraph @NUM2). Another obstacle was that most dirigibles outside of the @LOCATION2 use hydrogen, which is very flammable. When the ""Hindenburg"" was destroyed by fire, ""the owners... realized how much worse that could have been if it had taken place above a densly populated area such as downtown New York"" (paragraph @NUM3). The most significant obstacle was ""nature itself"" (paragraph @NUM4). Due to violent air currents, ""the winds on the top of the building were constantly shifting"" (paragraph @NUM4) in open areas, dirigibles could be weighted down by lead weights, but this poses a threat to pedestrians on the street, as the weights would be dangling above them.

"The builders of the Empire State building faced four main problems in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One of these problems was solved, the other three were not. The first obstacle was that since each dirigible would be connected to the top of the building by a single cable, enormous stress would be put on the frame of the building. This was solved by simply reinforcing the frame of the Empire State Building, but it cost over sixty thousand dollars to make the modifications. The second obstacle was not so easily solved. Dirigibles from other countries use hydrogen to stay afloat. Hydrogen is highly flammable, and the example of the Hindenburg blimp that burst into flame alerted the owners and builders of the Empire State Building to how dangerous an accident like that, especially in densely populated New York City, could be. The third obstacle also proved impossible to solve - because of the high speed of the winds at the top of the building, there would be no way for a dirigible to @CAPS1 safely. During the only test, the Los Angeles navy dirigible could not get close enough to @CAPS1 because of the high winds. It would have been all too easy for the dirigible to spin out of control and hit a spire on a nearby building. Lastly, there was already a law in place that prevented dirigibles from flying too close to urban areas, which would make it illegal to @CAPS1 or fly a ship in New York City..[Verse One (Tamika):]   The snow is falling like I knew it would,   Carolers are already singing..They say I had a big, red beard   But all you need to know   I was a Scottish rebel   And the English were my foe      William Wallace, Scottish rebel!.You owe me, and I need you   You owe me, and I need you   Party time, one more game, everybody's affected   This is my confession   This is my confession   Party time, one more lie, everybody's affected.I was staring at the sky   Just looking for a star   To pray on or wish on or something like that   I was having a sweet fix   Of a daydream of a boy   Whose reality I knew was a hopeless to be had   But then the dove of hope began its downward slope   And I believed for a moment   That my chances were approaching to be grabbed   But as it came down near   So did a weary tear   I thought it was a bird but it was just a paper bag      Hunger hurts and I want him so bad, oh it kills   'Cause I know I'm a mess he don't want to clean up   I've gotta fold 'cause these hands are too shaky to hold   Hunger hurts, starving works when it costs too much to love      And I went crazy again today   Looking for a strand to climb   Looking for a little hope   Baby said he couldn't stay   Wouldn't put his lips to mine   And a fail to kiss is a fail to cope   I said honey I don't feel so good   Don't feel justified   Come on put a little love here in my void   He said it's all in your head   I said so's everything but he didn't get it   I thought he was a man but he was just a little boy      Hunger hurts      Hunger hurts      Hunger hurts.Hey church I was thinking   The Third World seems to be sinking   Can't you all get over there   And we'll have them all over here      And you can learn to catch your own food   And you can learn to build your own hut   And we'll make up the usual excuse   To keep them in the pubs till they're shut      Hey skin, I just thought   The doctrine Hitler has taught   Is still kicking off in the States   Can't you go and join with your mates      Join up with the clueless clan   Dress up in a bag and a skirt   End up looking like a jerk   Meanwhile we'll have gone mad      And the hidden jukebox plays us a song   For each and everyone   For black, white, straight and the gay   Celebrate you being away      Hey Turk I was thinking   OK so l may have been drinking   You can come drink over here   And we'll fuck them off over there      Whisky for the Greek and the Turk   Gin for the Arab and the Jew   A double arsenic for Mister Le Pen   Cause it's him who soils Europe and not you      And the hidden jukebox plays us a song   Everyone should sing along   With a message that'll ring and ring   These are the words that we sing.Land your punch, I stand my ground,   We break for lunch and a second round..Prying open my third eye..Here I follow the journey backwards, from the body at the river bottom, to the man walking across the desert towards the banks of the Rio Grande..Later we went dancing, staying up all night long - playing all our favourite songs, Cinnamon songs: Oh oh na na na na na."
"Based on the information given in the excerpt, the obsticals that the builders of the Empire State Building had to face were critical to the usage of the dock. Not only is it a challenge to build 102 story building but when factoring in wind and other weather conditions it is not an easy task: In order for the builders of the Empire State Building to create and hoist the dock the top they needed to first reinforce the skeleton of the building itself.

"The were many obstacle's the builder's of the Empire State Building had to face in attempt to allow the docking of dirigible's. There was no way architects could drop a mooring mast on top of the building's smooth roof. If a thousand foot dirigible overshadowed the top of the building with only one cable tether, stress the building's frame would be added instantly. Stress of the dirigible's load and wind pressure would need to be transmitted all the way down to the building's foundation. Another obstacle for the builder's was that the building's steel frame would have to be strengthened to accommodate with this new design. The greatest obstacle in launching this new design was nature. Architects would needed to consider the constant shifting of winds due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigible was tied to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would be unsturdy. The fact that this design would be dangling above the pedestrians on the street, would worry the architects concern of the population. Architects also had to deal with the law against airships traveling too low above urban areas. This law would state the forbidden right of one to tether a large ship to a bulding, or even approach the area. Although there were attempts of dirigible's to reach a bulding, the entire idea was dropped, much to the architects despite..Kiss me again, rekiss me and kiss me   Slip your frigid hands beneath my shirt   This useless old fucker with his twinkling cunt   Doesn't care if he gets hurt      Green eyes, green eyes   Green eyes, green eyes      If it were but a matter of faith   If it were measured in petitions and prayer   She would materialize, all fleshed out   But it is not, nor do I care      Green eyes, green eyes   Green eyes, green eyes      So hold me and hold me, don't tell me your name   This morning will be wiser than this evening is   Then leave me to my enemied dreams   And be quiet as you are leaving this      Green eyes...

"There were many obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the mast. One obstacle they faced was nature itself. It says in the exerpt that ""the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around."" This could have led to major accidents if the dirigibles were allowed to dock here. Another obstacle they faced was that these dirigibles could not fly to low over urban cities. It says in the excerpt that ""these was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area."" But before the idea was even dropped, two dirigibles attempted to reach the building. The first one could not reach the building because of forceful winds. The second airship attempted a stunt to drop off a bundle of news papers. They didn't have the right equipment so they had to have a worker catch the bundle of papers that were attached by a rope. These obstacles were very important to be construction of the mast because it's probably saved the lifes not only the aviators but the people that lived in urban cities below..you got it right   'Cause their cowboy hats was White   So I asked 'em as they pulled their reins towards the settin' sun   I said, ""Before you go, I'd like to know, just where you boys come from?"".One string puppet shows amuse   Your sycophantic friends   Who cheer your rancid recipes   In fear they might offend,   Whilst you loaf on your sofa   Sporting falsies and a toga   Playing Indoor Games, Indoor Games..When it falls away, you'll see we exist as well!.Don't act like you don't want it, come on you can't lie..Let the bullets go!.Play to the crowd   with your big hit sound..What I have to say can't wait, all I need is a day,      [Bridge]   So let's runaway for the day,   And I'll give everything in this moment..Am I coming through just fine?.Set it spinning turning roundabout."
"The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there because dirigibles had a top speed of eighty miles per hour. The one obstacle to their expanded use in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area. Dirigibles were docked by means of an electric winch, which hauled in a line from the front of the ship and then tied it to a mass. Also the body of the dirigibles they could swing in the breeze, and yet passengers could safely get on and off..Too paid to freestyle..Well I've been waiting, waiting here so long   But thinking nothing, nothing could go wrong, ooh now I know   She has a built in ability   To take everything she sees   And now it seems I'm falling, falling for her..At work he is invariably unpleasant and unkind..Yes I've brought the cookies..Workin' on the railroad..Every time I end up waking up   In some hotel without my   Set of keys   Coming to, remembering the way   Your turned me out when I was   On my knees   You think that was   One up for you   But I know I scored something too      When I see the way you have to struggle   Just to do a little simple thing   I feel apologetic   Just because I'm not particularly suffering   So I let you take me down   I'm like your rent-a-clown      When I saw my baby cry   I knew that he loved me   That was some great victory   He cried because of me   He hit me with his belt   But his tears were all I felt   When I saw my baby cry   I knew he loved me      When you try and cut me down   And push me back   If I attack your attitude   I rise up to the challenge 'cause   I like to taste the sugar of your violent mood   Just like a stormy sea   You're natural   Poetry to me      When I saw my baby cry   I knew that he loved me   That was some great victory   He cried because of me   He hit me with his belt   But his tears were all I felt   When I saw my baby cry   I knew he loved me   I knew he loved me.You can leave now if you don't like what's happening..Someday I'll get over you..I just walk along and stroll and sing,   I see better days and I do better things."
"Some problems the designers faced, were the violent air currents that form in urban areas, this would be a problem because the dirigible would be tossed around due to it's light weight. Another problem, is the fact that it would be too dangerous to land a dirigible over a densely populated area like New York City..I should have known when you first started   Runnin' away before my eyes..You?.From the pan into the fire   Now a thread becomes a wire   Under which you must crawl   Through a ditch and over the wall      Emily works her fingers   Right down to her aching bones   While my aching head's got me stuck   In bed working on being alone      Working around the clock   Wishing she had worked it out with me   Poor little emily   How does it feel to be free?.Out!.The first time I saw you   I felt weak inside   I searched my heart and mind   For words I couldn't find   Somehow you seemed to see   What came over me that night   As a love began to grow   That would last for all time   And you said,   I can see it in your eyes   They're the windows to your soul   Sometimes they say more   Than words could ever hold   We could wait a thousand lifetimes   And never feel like this again   But when you look at me that way   I can see it in your eyes   Later on I asked your hand   And I prayed the time was right   I knelt down on one knee   And said would you be my bride?.Yeah, I hit the wall   Woke up this mornin'   And I hit the wall..Close your eyes and I'll kiss you   Tomorrow I'll miss you   Remember I'll always be true   And then while I'm away   I'll write home every day   And I'll send all my loving to you      I'll pretend that I'm kissing   The lips I am missing   And hope that my dreams will come true   And then while I'm away   I'll write home every day   And I'll send all my loving to you      All my loving I will send to you   All my loving, darling I'll be true      Close your eyes and I'll kiss you   Tomorrow I'll miss you   Remember I'll always be true   And then while I'm away   I'll write home every day   And I'll send all my loving to you      All my loving I will send to you   All my loving, darling I'll be true   All my loving, all my loving ooh   All my loving I will send to you.They're so far away   You can't even see what's right in front of you   Flesh wounds heal   Broken bones mend   But you're not my friend   I never want to see you again....There is this rumor about   They say you're leaving Nehalem   Ever since our baby died      You've been seen with another guy   The whole damn town is talking now   They say you're leaving Nehalem   Hey don't you want me to go?"

"Based on the excerpt, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle was that United States dirigibles used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. If the dirigible was ever destroyed by fire above a densely populated area like downtown New York the accident could be very dangerous. One of the grestest obstacle of using the mooring mast was nature itself. The author says ""The winds on top of building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" Dangling lead weights to weigh it down over pedestrians on the streets was niether practical nor safe. The Mooring Mast by @ORGANIZATION2 tells a few obstacles the builders had to face to allow dirigibles to dock the Empire State Building..So full of joy, why am I absurd   Even Chingy would tell you   'Yea boi don't curr'      See us come to award shows we're like (Oh yeah)   Can we get more of those, they're like (Oh yeah)   See us keep blowin' up, we're like (Oh yeah)   See Jimmy can crack corn but I don't care   See me in your videos, I'm like (Oh yeah)   See me right up close, you're like (Oh Em)   And where is D12 at, they're like (We over here)   And where the fuck we goin', we're like (Nowhere)      Yo' homie got clapped on, man I don't care   The cops in my nana crib, but I'm not there   It is what it is dawg, man life's not fair   Yo' friends shoulda known not to front 'round here   You see kid, where I'm from, the wolves smell fear   They'll strip yo ass, of your jewels, right here   Man I'm a say this one time, now get this clear   Man you can catch a hot one like outta no where   A beautiful day, without drama is rare   Yo' girl's a freak, man sometime we share   Yeah, I wear a condom and you go bare   You probably heard about me, I'm a shown up playa   In the hood politicin', like I'm runnin' for mayor   Ridin', winin', dinin' and shinin', know what I'm sayin'   I ain't got time for fuckin' around, and horseplayin'   I'm makin' hits, my homies takin' hits, who's stayin'      See us come to award shows we're like (Oh yeah)   Can we get more of those, they're like (Oh yeah)   See us keep blowin' up, we're like (Oh yeah)   See Jimmy can crack corn but I don't care   See me in your videos, I'm like (Oh yeah)   See me right up close, you're like (Oh Em)   And where is D12 at, they're like (We over here)   And where the fuck we goin', we're like (Nowhere).The US is the eagle, Russia is the bear,   Australia is the kangaroo, cause they're kind of weird down there..He's holding on to the telephone   saying, please, don't let the show go on..If you made it this far listening without skipping   Then I gotta show love, don't worry I'm just venting   The late night thoughts of a nigga on a mission   And I rock my girl to sleep in missionary position   Tuck that ass in and then I went and grabbed a pen   And now you have it, words flowing like magic, it's truly accurate   You niggas posing like some hoes up in a beauty pageant!.They do it and then they do it again..Shut the fuck up!.I told 'em he was one of my best friends and whiskey could never make Gorge Jones quit singing..Nobody, nobody   Nobody, nobody   Nobody, nobody.Yours like D?"
" The builders of the Empire state building faced countless problems in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One main problem is safety. Even though the dirigibles was going to be hooked on top of the building the wind could potentially whip the dirigible to crash into the building. Also after the crash of the Hindenburg the builders realized how much damage could be done if that were to happen in New York. Another problem they faced is the laws. The law prohibited any aircraft flying too low over urban areas. These problems caused this idea to disappear..Mmm...I shouldn't, I really shouldn't..Say goodbye, my baby..It seems like it's all going wrong   There's a storm in the sky passing over   And it looks like it's going to be strong      You've got eyes like an old wounded soldier   They cry tears to be lost in the wind      Hey Joe   Hey Joe   Hey Joe   What are you gonna do?.Let your body lay in there, warm flesh to your fear..Tear drops fell on mama's note   When I read the things she wrote   She said, we miss you girl   We love you come on home   Well I didn't have to pack   I had it all right on my back   Now I'm five hundred miles away from home      Away from home, away from home   Cold and tired and all alone   Yes, I'm five hundred miles away from home      It's hard to tell the state I'm in   Where I'm going, where I've been   But there's a dream I've been following so long   If mama knew the things I've done   She'd forgive them everyone   But I'm still five hundred miles away from home      Away from home, away from home   Cold and tired and all alone   Yes, I'm five hundred miles away from home      Can't remember when I ate it's just thumb and walk and wait   And I'm still five hundred miles away from home   If my luck had been just right I'd be with them all tonight   But I'm still five hundred miles away from home      Away from home, away from home   Cold and tired and all alone   Yes, I'm five hundred miles away from home      Lord, I'm still five hundred miles away from home.Since I lost the power to pretend   That there could ever be a happy ending..(Ooh)      You should already know you should be with me..And you said nothing at all   Well I couldn't have said it better myself   Tonight the conversation takes the fall   Just love me like you love nobody else      Little lady, I think there's something on your mind   I've known you long enough to know   The words are not that hard to find      And the harder you try and the longer you go   Well there's nothing but love in those eyes any more   You know what to say but you never know how   You can keep your mouth shut because it doesn't really matter right now      I will guide you all the way   Because I know exactly what you're trying to say      You have the right to remain silent   I'll get the lights, you get that smile      And you say nothing at all   Well I couldn't have said it better myself   Tonight the conversation takes the fall   Just love me like you love nobody else      I see the angels, they're standing right outside your door   They're watching over me, they're watching over us all   You can send them home tonight, because you won't need them anymore   In your arms I think I've found the safest place to fall   When I step in the door and I stare at your face   There are so many things that I wish I could say   Well I struggle with words but they put up a fight   You can keep your mouth shut, because it doesn't really matter tonight      I will guide you all the way   Because I know exactly what you're trying to say   You have the right to remain silent   I'll get the lights   You get that smile      And you say nothing at all   Well I couldn't have said it better myself   Tonight the conversation takes the fall   Just love me like you love nobody else      And I know you feel the same   You've been searching for the words,   Now you know what to say      Just say nothing   Don't say a word   Silence is gold   Don't say a word      This is the moment we've been waiting for   If I exercise my right   I will take your body language and hold it against you tonight      And I know you feel the same   I've wondered all my life, if this moment comes would I know what to say   Then you say nothing at all   So many times I stumbled on the words I wanted to say   Then you say nothing at all   So many thoughts, that I should have just let my heart explain   Then you say nothing at all   So many ways we could turn the words around   Then you say nothing at all   So many nights our hearts came crashing to the ground   Then you say nothing at all   So many dreams that are finally coming true   Well, I couldn't have said it better myself   Now you finish me off when you finish my thoughts the way you do      You say nothing at all   Well I couldn't have said it better myself   Tonight the conversation takes the fall   Just love me like you love nobody else.One day, as I was walking through my garden, I saw a little frog lying on the ground."
"To allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building was difficult. For example, the mast was really hard to build it. The engineers and architects needed to think about how to do it. And made sure passengers' safety. First of all, dirigibles is heavy. Hydrogen might be make it broken. Nobody know what will be happen when dirigibles fly on the sky. The body of the dirigible could swing in the wind. Perhaps out off controll.Which floor can we put the mast is also really important. I think no one like to work under the huge heavy dirigibles..So many memories   Are knocked down or replaced..How can I trust my eyes, do they really see   What is the truth?.Hey you can't you see?.Come alive, come on in, here's something that you know..I put a spell on you..oooh!.(baby, baby, baby)   Am I the one you're dreaming of?.And in my soul I know someday I'll find salvation..But what's the use if we end up a memory   Remembering our honesty   I always thought that's what you want of me   But now the truth has made you turn your back on me   Oh, can't you see      Chorus then Bridge:   I've got to find a way   I beg you babe   I need to hear you say   You love me      If I have the chance   I won't let you go   I'll stay by your side   I'll be lovin' you darlin'   And for all of my life   I will let you know   You're my only love   Just believe in me darlin'      Look in my eyes   I swear this is true   I you want it   You got it   I promise you Loraine      Repeat Chorus to fade      I swear I love you   I always will   This kind of feeling never came to me until Loraine"
"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lüsted the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The first problem they encountered was that when moored at the top of the building the dirigible would add stress to the buildings frame. The builders would then have to ""modify and strengthen the empire state building to this new situation."" Another obstacle the builders would have to face is that since a dirigible used hydrogen it would be highly flammable. The builders didnt want an ""accident to take place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York. Lastly builders would have to face the obstacle of Nature. With winds so strong up top the building the dirigibles would need to be weighted down in back with lead weights which would be neither safe nor practical dangling high above pedestrians in New York City. In conclusion ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION2 the builders go through many obstacles in building the empire state building..Can anybody play?.So long, Frank Lloyd Wright..Who can I run to,   To fill this empty space with laughter?.[Chorus:]   And in this crazy life, and through these crazy times   It's you, it's you, you make me sing   You're every line, you're every word, you're everything..Cry for help is all I need..What you need is to have some faith   Shake off those sad blues   Get yourself a new view      Oh, nothing is as sad as it seems, you know   'Cause someday you'll laugh at the heartache   Someday you'll laugh at the pain   Somehow you'll get through the heartache   Somehow you can get through the rain      [Chorus]   When love puts you through the fire   When love puts you through the test   Nothing cures a broken heart   Like time, love, and tenderness   When you think your world is over   Baby, just remember this   Nothing heals a broken heart   Like time, love, and tenderness   Time, love, and tenderness      I understand how you're feeling now   And what you've been through   But your world's gonna turn around   So, baby, don't you be blue   All it takes is a little time   To make it better   The hurt won't last forever      Oh, all the tears are gonna dry you know   'Cause someday you'll laugh at the heartache   Someday you'll laugh at the pain   You may be down on your luck   But, baby, that old luck's gonna change      [Chorus]      Baby, oh baby you just need some   You just need some   Time, love, and tenderness   Time, love, and tenderness   The hurt ain't gonna last forever   Time, love, and tenderness   Time, love, and tenderness.Sade, tell me...

"The lack of the landing area. Also the body of the dirigible can Swing Is another obstacle that the Empire State Building faced. The other obstacle they faced, ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" The dirigibles were flying to low over the urban areas and that is a law against airships. The @ORGANIZATION2 from Los Angeles could not get close enuff to tie up the dirigible do to the wind.

"The invention of the mass on top of the Empire State Building was an undeveloped idea that created created a new means of transportation but arrive with numerous flaws. One obstacle the engineers faced was resting a one thousand foot dirigible over a twelve hundred fifty foot building because with combined wind pressure this would put stress on the building's structure and allow it to collapse. This transportation was also extremely dangerous to the public because many foreign dirigibles ""used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable (paragraph @NUM1)."" Not only this, if builders ever allowed dirigible's to dock on the building, the back of the airship would spin around the mooring mast due to shifting violent air currents as stated in paragraph @NUM2. In paragraph @NUM3, it says that an existing law would prohibit airships flying too low over urban areas. This law made docking dirigibles atop of the Empire State Building illegal because dirigibles would be above the people which was against the laws. All of these obstacles made the transportations a failure and as a result the use of the mast had disappeared..Don' t you know we need you!.Is this your grave, Jackie Brown?.But like a monkey on your back, you need it..down farther, feelin?.You went away and my heart went with you   I speak your name in my every prayer   If there is some other way   To prove that I love you   I swear I don't know how   You'll never know if you don't know now..Happy birthday, happy birthday, happy birthday (woo, shake!).I should just let 'em go, but      I can see you,   Your brown skin shining in the sun..Papa drove a truck nearly all his life   You know it drove mama crazy being a trucker's wife   The part she couldn't handle was the being alone   I guess she needed more to hold than just a telephone   Papa called Mama each and every night   Just to ask her how she was and if us kids were alright   Mama would wait for that call to come in   When Daddy'd hang up then she was gone again   Mama was a looker   Lord, how she shined   Papa was a good'n   But the jealous kind   Papa loved Mama   Mama loved men   Mama's in the graveyard   Papa's in the pen   Well, it was bound to happen and one night it did   Papa came home and it was just us kids   He had a dozen roses and a bottle of wine   If he was lookin' to surprise us, he was doin' fine   I heard him cry for mama up and down the hall   Then I heard a bottle break against the bedroom wall   That old diesel engine made an eerie sound   When Papa fired it up and headed into town   Well, the picture in the paper showed the scene real well   Papa's rig was buried in the local motel   The desk clerk said he saw it all real clear   He never hit the brakes and he was shifting gears   Mama was a looker   Lord, how she shined   Papa was a good'n   But the jealous kind   Papa loved Mama   Mama loved men   Mama's in the graveyard   Papa's in the pen.baby, baby, baby   Honey baby, please come home   Your dad-ad-dy is lon-one-some and all I do is moan   I promise you baby that I'll be good   And I'll never be bad no more   I'm sittin' here waitin' for you right now   To walk through that front door   Then I'll stop moanin' moa-oanin' the blues."
"There were many obstacles facing the builders attempting to allow dirgibles to dock on the mast of the Empire State Building. One reason was that attaching a humongous blimp to the peak of the building would add excessive strain to it. Lusted explains: ""A thousand-foot dirgible moored at the top of the building... would add stress to the building's frame."" @CAPS1, much revision to the structure's frame was needed. Another obstacle was nature. Wind currents would push the dirigible around and it would be very unsafe. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirgible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" This would make it unsafe for passengers to get on or off the blimp. There was also a law in effect that prevented ""airships flying too low over urban areas."" These obstacles prevented the builders from safely devising a way to dock the dirigibles..Who are you now?.If you're in my heart   Say I could and I would be strong, man   Say I could and I would be strong, man      World in another   I was trapped within   A world within another   World in another      Say I was trapped within   A world within another      And is it true?.I get the same old dreams same time every night   Fall to the ground and I wake up   So I get out of bed, put on my shoes and in my head   Thoughts fly back to the breakup      These four wall are closing in   Look at the fix you put me in      Since you been gone   Since you been gone   I'm out of my head can't take it   Could I be wrong   But since you been gone   You cast your spell so break it   Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh   Since you been gone      So in the night I stand beneath the backstreet light   I read the words that you sent to me   I can take the afternoon, the night time comes around   too soon   You can't know what you mean to me      Your poison letter, your telegram   Just goes to show you don't give a damn      Since you been gone   Since you been gone   I'm out of my head can't take it   Could I be wrong   But since you been gone   You cast your spell so break it   Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh   Since you been gone      If you will come back   Baby, you know you'll never do wrong      Since you been gone   Since you been gone   I'm out of my head can't take it   Could I be wrong   But since you been gone   You cast your spell so break it   Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh   Ever since you been gone      Since you been gone   Since you been gone   I'm out of my head can't take it   Since you been gone   Since you been gone   I'm out of my head can't take it.Lo, oh, loneliness      Loneliness, so lonely, loneliness, so lonely   Loneliness, so lonely, loneliness, so lonely   Loneliness, so lonely, loneliness, so lonely   Loneliness, so lonely, loneliness, so lonely   Loneliness, so lonely.If you're bound and you're gagged, draped and displayed   Would you still love me anyway?.I know.Walk on, talk on,   Baby tell no lies..How far is the journey   From here to a star?.I'll be a devil, till I'm an angel, but until then."
"Architects for the Empire State Building faced many problems trying install the landing gear on the mooring mast. There were many safety issues to get around landing a dirigible or blimp on the building. People in a populated area such as New York City, is not the safest place to land a blimp, ""when the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire on May 6, 1937, the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as dowtown New York."" They could not take this risk. So, the competion for landing gear was called off. Another main cause was the wind current on top of the Empire State Building. It proved very difficult to keep a blimp level at high altitudes, ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" This could potentially result in the blimp detaching and hitting other buildings. This is why landing blimps on the Empire State building would be dangerous and difficult..These things   That I've   Been told   Can rearrange   My world   My doubt   In time   But inside out   This is the working hour   We are paid by those who learn by our mistake   This day   And age   For all   And not for one   All lies   And secrets   Put on   Put on and on   This is the working hour   We are paid by those who learn by our mistake   And fear is such a vicious thing   It wraps me up in chains   Find out   Find out   What this fear is about   Find out   Find out   What this fear is about.And you know it's time to go   Through the sleet and driving snow   Across the fields of mourning   Light in the distance      And you hunger for the time   Time to heal, desire, time   And your earth moves beneath   Your own dream landscape      Oh, oh, oh   On borderland we run      I'll be there   I'll be there   Tonight   A high road   A high road out from here      The city walls are all come down   The dust, a smoke screen all around   See faces ploughed like fields that once   Gave no resistance      And we live by the side of the road   On the side of a hill   As the valley explode   Dislocated, suffocated   The land grows weary of its own      Oh, oh, oh on borderland we run   And still we run   We run and don't look back   I'll be there   I'll be there   Tonight   Tonight      I'll be there tonight I believe   I'll be there somehow   I'll be there tonight   Tonight      The wind will crack in winter time   This bomb-blast lightning waltz   No spoken words, just a scream      Tonight we'll build a bridge   Across the sea and land   See the sky, the burning rain   She will die and live again   Tonight      And your heart beats so slow   Through the rain and fallen snow   Across the fields of mourning   Light's in the distance      Oh don't sorrow, no don't weep   For tonight, at last   I am coming home   I am coming home.Well, this is such a sad affair   I've opened up my heart so many times   But now it's closed   Oh my dear   Every salted tear   It wrings   Bitter-sweet applause   But when the show's in full swing   Every once in awhile   High stepping chorus lines   Mean I'm forgetting   Mein lullaby - liebchen   How rich in contrast   Love can be   Sometimes I'm quite amused   To see it twist and turn   To taste both sweet and dry   These vintage years   Lovers you consume, my friend   As others their wine   Nein - das ist nicht   Das ende der welt   Gestrandet an leben und kunst   Und das spiel geht weiter   Wie man weiss   Noch viele schoum....

"In this excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"", by @ORGANIZATION1, workers and builders try to make a docking area for Dirigibles (blimps). In the process in doing so they @CAPS1 many obstacles. First, obstacle was the lack of a suitable landing area. They really should've thought to make it bigger in the first place. Workers did work but was not enuff. The greatest obstacle was nature itself. If they were good builders and knew what they were doing and then they would know that wind up higher gets ruffer. Bacicaly should have thought things through a little more; lastly, was the law against airships flying to low over urban areas. Should have checked if there were ney laws which there was; Also, all that work for nothing. All these obstacles that the workers and builders @CAPS2 were things that could have been prevented, so money and time did not have went to waste..Excited at prospects,   Humbled and mad   Needy as a baby....And though I loose a friend,   In the end you will know..You loved me back to life, life   From the coma, we're lovers again tonight..(hey yo cube)   Make it ruff   (cube check it out)   Whats up?.Lifting weights of conscious..Phineas: Of course!.Hey bully   Oh, strike   Lightning      Hey, Chi man   That melody is Puerto Rican   Hey Chi man, is what he's speaking   And there's the road down into London Town where many cars get broken down   It's the Westway from Ladbroke Grove   Runs down to Old Hounslow   Hash my brother, caught a fuff   Because, because you know it   Just thought I'd mention the new extention that run's down the 59th street intersection   Did you hear the news y'all?.Or cause I don't want to fight?.The devil's got a hold of my soul and he won't let me be."
"In the short story ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION2, The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. For example they needed a suitable landing area which they could not do very easily. They needed to put a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building, but the architects could not do that with no problem. It took a lot of work. The @CAPS1 says ""The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof."" @CAPS2 they had an idea to add to make it work, would add stress to the building and take it down. The wind pressure had a great deal on that also. The winds were making it hard to keep the Dirigibles stable. They wanted to add weights to hold it down but that wouldn't be good for the people below. The @CAPS1 says ""Could be weighted down in the back with lead weights, but using these at the Empire State Building, where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street, was neither practical nor safe. They faced way to many problems..Go, go   Go, Johnny go, go   Go, Johnny go, go   Go, Johnny go, go   Go, Johnny go, go   Johnny B.

"The builders of the Empire State Building had a lot of struggles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. First, they had to consult with experts to see if the equipment was safe enough. They took tours of the equipment and mooring operations at the @ORGANIZATION2 at Lakehurst, New Jersey. Next, they had a hard time dropping the mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof. They would have to us @MONEY1 worth of modifications to strengthen the building's framework. They were never going to have this happen in the first place, because of the safety issue, the hydrogen gas in the dirigible is highly flammable. The biggest issue though, was nature. The winds on top of the building made it very hard to work, and it got very violent..Like a high jacked plane,   Or a runaway train,   Or a speeding bullet,   There's no stopping this!.Standing at the stone   Of one of our own   He died saving my life   He took the lead   Aimed for my head   Such love shown I'd never known      Give me the gun   I love you   A job half done   Isn't done      Standing at the stone   Of one of our own   He took the plug   And he hit the rug   Such love shown I've never known   Now I don't want to know tomorrow      So, give me the gun   I love you   A job half done   Isn't done      Kneeling at the stone   Of one of our own   He took a round   And he hit the ground   He took the blast   His very last   I have no use for tomorrow      No use for tomorrow   No use for tomorrow   No use for tomorrow   No use for tomorrow   No use for...

"Based on the excerpt, The Mooring Mast, obstacles for the builders of the Empire State Building were presented because dirigibles were to dock there. The first obstacle was safety because most dirigibles from outside of the @LOCATION3 were filled with hydrogen which is very flammable compared to helium. The builders were concerned because on May 6, 1937 the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire, since it was filled by hydrogen, in Lakehurst, New Jersey. The second obstacle was nature: ""The winds... were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around the mooring mast"" (paragraph @NUM1). This meant that passengers could not get off safely and the dirigible could hit anything in the vicinity if swung a wrong way. The last obstacle was an existing law against airships fly too low over urban areas which means that it was illegal for a ship to tie up to a building or approach the area. Therefore, the builders of the Empire State Building who attempted to allow dirigibles to dock there were presented many obsticles as shown by the excerpt, The Mooring Mast..I can't remember the letters I just wrote a lot of them   Goin for a ride that I cannot stop   Set up shop in Cochran, connect the dots   And for those that don't know, that's the Pen-East to Fresno   Northeast to Baskersfield, fuck ""Let's Make a Deal""   Livin around niggaz who kill, right along with the niggaz who will   At the drop of a hat, sharpen up anything hard to stab you with that   Niggaz givin up the manhood they can't get back   It's a sick university, murder the cirriculum   Concrete campuses, I miss Los Angeles   More than that I'm missin my kids   Missin my turf, missin my bitch, what could be worse?...

"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many challenges with docking airships one of the most obveouse reasons was the danger of docking at such high altitudes. If an accident accured like a fire, the entire area would be in danger. The modifications made to the building itself were big enough, without needing any more additional work done. The most import reason would be manoverability. The strong winds made it difficult and almost impossable to control the blimp, never less dock it. The @ORGANIZATION2 law even banned aircraft of any type flying so low..Are you aware of what   You make me feel, baby   Right now I feel invisible to you   Like I'm not real   Didn't you feel me lock my arms around you   Why'd you turn away   Here's what I have to say      I was left to cry there   Waiting outside there   Grinning with the lost stare   That's when I decided      Why should I care   'Cause you weren't there   When I was scared   I was so alone      You, you need to listen   I'm startin' to trip   I'm losing my grip   And I'm in this thing alone   (oh oh yeah)      Am I just some chick   You placed beside you   To take somebody's place?.Black..I'm floating over strange land,   And then stranger still, there's no balloon..Caress me, undress me, fill me with desire   Do the kind of things to me that set my heart on fire      (repeat)      Hey you!.Should have been a politician""   But he never had a proper education   ""What could he do?.You're a drain brain, you go on and on like a blood stain..Now that the holidays have come   They can relax and watch the sun   Rise above all of the beautiful things   They've done..How stupid is it?.Let's take a ride, and run with the dogs tonight   In Suburbia   You can't hide, run with the dogs tonight   In Suburbia   In Suburbia   In Suburbia      Run with the dogs tonight   You can't hide   Run with the dogs tonight   You can't hide   (You can't hide, you can't hide)   In Suburbia      (Suburbia, where the suburbs met Utopia)   (What kind of dream was this, so easy to destroy?)"
"The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there is that they had to make the Empire State Building taller. The builders added a mooring mast to the top of the building to allow dirigibles to anchor the for several hours for refueling or service, and to allow the passengers on or off the dirigible. The dirigibles were docked which meant that the electric winch, in which hauled in a line from the front of the ship and then tied to the mast.

"Dirigibles were being hailed as the transportation of the future. They were much better than the balloons. In new York City, there was a lack of suitable landing areas for the dirigibles. Now this would be a good idea for the Empire State Building. Landing on the building would allow dirigibles to anchor there for several hours for refueling or other services. The architects could not just drop a mooring mast on top of the building. The dirigible is thousand-foot long. It would add stress to the building's frame. Engineers soon designed a shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel tower. The mast had four wings at its corners. The building is now 102 floors. Floors @NUM1 and 102 were for the observation area to double as the boarding area for the dirigible passengers. Workers celebrate framing the entire building after two months. Now people lost their hope. It's because the mooring mast of the Empire State Building was never to fulfill its purpose. It was never safe nor practical. The buiders faces so many obstacles..It's just a matter of time   Before I make you mine   I want to make it clear   So there's no misunderstandings   That I get what I want - when I want, yeah      If I want to - I can take you from your man   With my eyes closed   I can have you eating out the palm out of my hand   And all your little girl friends to   (No you can't - you're a playa I don't want you)   Yes I can and I will if I - if I want to   If I - if I want to baby      If I want to - I can take you from your man   With my eyes closed   I can have you eating out the palm out of my hand   And all your little girl friends to   (No you can't - you're a playa I don't want you)   Yes I can and I will if I - if I want to   If I - if I want to baby      (Yeah, uh - oh)   That I get what I want - when I want   If I wanted to      (If I wanted to - I'd have you doing whatever I want you to)   (You know - right now I'm just not really doing that)   (But if I wanted to - anything)   (I'm saying - you and your girls, I could have them too)   Listen to me!.[2x]      We get colder,   As we grow older..Dying impatiens   Stacked up wood..What would you say?.I get no kick from champagne   Mere alcohol doesn't thrill me at'all   So tell me why should it be true?.Again....Cooked his ass with a crackling sound   Watch as the ash comes juggling down   I smoke them bones and I get much illa   Fink, The Eastside G   The Santa Claus killa      (Chorus 2x)   Santa Claus   I'm comin'   I'm comin'   I'm comin'   The Santa Claus killaz      (Violent J)   One last minute   I get's deadly   Sit back children   Check the medley   Its cold out, I could give a fuck less   Cause I'm waitin' on a bitch in a red dress   A fat bitch with a big white beard   Strapped with a big lead pipe I'm geared   I hear bells, Jing-a-Ling-Jing-Ling-Ding-a-Ling   That's the sound, the dead man here   The dead man here when death is near   I take my pipe and say fuck it   Whip and Lug It   Straight to the nugget   Out cold in a flash, a dash   Then I pushed his ass off the roof   And straight jacked the sleigh   The ghetto's payday from the Santa Claus killa      (Chorus 2x)   Santa Claus   I'm comin'   I'm comin'   I'm comin'   The Santa Claus killaz.That's where the problems come from   Sometimes isn't it?.The judgment and wrath   He poured out on Sodom,   The mercy and grace   He gave us at the cross,   I hope that we have not   Too quickly forgotten that our   God is an awesome God."

"The builders of the Empire State Building faced a few obstacles when having dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle for example was landing. New York lacked a suitable landing area for a dirigible. Architects couldn't just drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof. Also, safety was a problem. A German dirigible was destroyed by fire. The owners of the Empire State Building realized how the accident could've been worse, especially in New York. Even nature was an obstacle. Winds were constantly shifting on top of the building. So lead weights were used for the dirigible which wasn't safe, because they were dangling over pedestrians. There was a law that airships couldn't fly too low over urban areas..Just a crazy mug,   Drinks liquor by the jug,   He's alive with lots of jive,   Doug the jitterbug!.Let it snow!.Eye for an eye..All in good time, we'll be just fine   Either way we need to be happy!.Thank God   I'm on the road tonight   With this old hillbilly band..Well I can wash out forty four pairs of socks   And have 'em on the line..When we realize we're only to die then we're out of here   We're just skirting on the surface   We have only to click our fingers and we disappear   We're just skirting on the surface      Doll eyes trying to pull you through the ice   Being drawn to the ledge   When we realize that once we're broken then nothing mends   We're just skirting on the surface      When we realize we're only held in suspension   Until someone comes along and shakes us   And as the pattern lines cross their fingers like a web   Will we die upon the surface?.King of the Bongo   (M.

"While designing a dirigible docked at the top of the Empire State building, the architects and engineers encountered many obstacles. Being such an immense project, these obstacles came naturally. The first obstacle was purely architectural. ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building... would add stress to the building's frame."" The architects would have to redesign the building frame in order for the building to last. The two other obstacles should have been clear from the start; the first, being nature. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" Now, the dock not only would be hard to reach, but extremely unsafe. The last obstacle couldn't have been overcome by the architects or engineers if they tried, not legally anyway. ""... existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas"" would also restrict the project, and actually stop it alltogether. Clearly, some large deciding factors had been overlooked while designing the moor. @ORGANIZATION2's competitive attitude made this so, but ""The Mooring Mast... was never destined to fulfill its purpose."".Synopses   Cavaradossi is working on a portrait of the Madonna for the church of Saint Andrea..Sitting here in Avalon, looking at the pouring rain   Summertime has come and gone and everybody's home again      Closing down for the season, I found the last of the souvenirs   I can still taste the wedding cake and it's sweet after all these years      These are the last words I have to say   That's why this took so long to write   There will be other words some other day   But that's the story of my life      There's comfort in my coffee cup and apples in the early fall   They're pulling all the moorings up and gathering at the Legion Hall   They swept away all the streamers after the Labor Day parade   Nothing left for a dream now, only one final serenade      And these are the last words I have to say   Before another age goes by   With all those other songs I'll have to play   But that's the story of my life      And it's so clear standing here where I am   Ain't that what justice is for?.I want to know did you get the feelin'?.Free to be a trend   Were the lights too bright?.You say you jest can't see..Etc.).[Chorus:]   Yea, oh yea, yea   Do you want to break-up?.I get up, I get down..It was a strong hit from the money machine, Sitting on top, on top of the world."
"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many promblems when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Most of there problem they encountered when designing the mast. They found that they could not just drop a mooring mast on top of the building at a thousand feet. The building was not strong enough, so they had to strengthen the building with a new steel frame. Then the builders also faced safety issues. At a thousand feet the air currents were extremely violant. By the end of the construction it was quickly noticed that dirigibles could not land on the Empire State Building..And brick by brick,   We'll get back to yesterday   When I made your body shiver   And when you took my breath away,   You took my breath away..To how mi high, when mi look down,   Skyscraper left..I wonder if we could maybe go there and have something to eat?.I'm living in a bad dream   I'm living in a bad dream that's sad..Chorus:   All my life's a circle   Sunrise and sundown   Moon rolls through the nighttime   Till daybreak comes around   All my life's a circle   Still I wonder why   Seasons spinning 'round again   Years keep rolling by      Seems like I've been here before   Can't remember when   I got this funny feeling   We'll all be together again   No straight lines make up my life   All my roads have bends   No clear cut beginnings   So far no dead ends      Chorus      I've met you a thousand times   I guess you've done the same   Then we lose each other   It's like a children's game   But now I find you here again   The thought comes to my mind   Our love is like a circle   Let's go 'round one more time      Chorus.I was born in Guilford County   Way back up in the pines   It's where I hold the sweetest memories   In the hills of Caroline      My daddy wasn't much of nothin'   Spent his life doin' time   But mama learned me about Jesus   In the hills of Caroline      I met a girl her name was Hattie   Fair and tender, sweet and kind   She showed me how to love a woman   In the hills of Caroline      I always thought that we would marry   One sweet day she would be mine   But Hattie's gone, to live with Jesus   In the hills of Caroline      If I should die before tomorrow   Just one request if you don't mind   Just bury me right next to Hattie   In the hills of Caroline      Bury me right next to Hattie   In the hills of Caroline.(Ah) Looks just like an angel, but he's just talking trash   (Ah) He'll make conversation, but she's listening to your cash   (Ah) 'take those', 'need' and 'give all', this much you understand   All I want to give you woman (Oh)   Is the best part of a man, yeah   Oh, mmm, uh, mm, mm   Love that woman,heart and soul   In the grooves,on the go,   You know   Ah yeah!.Here is my   Small black box   Filled with hurt   Sent by you   Here is my   Small black book   Filled with lies   Told by you   Here is my   Small black house   Filled with fear   Thanks to you   Here is my   Small black heart   Filled with shame   Left by you   See I   See I Don't know   And I don't feel the pressure   And I don't feel the pressure   Here is my   Small black doubt   Filled by tears   Cried for you   here is my   Small black wish   Filled by dreams   Lost by you   See I   See I Don't know   And I don't feel the pressure   And I don't feel the pressure.Y'all still want me to come with you?"
"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many problems that prevented dirigibles from landing there. It was too dangerous to tether dirigibles to the mast of the building for four main reasons. The first was that a dirigible moored to the mast of the building ""would add stress to the building's frame"". This problem was soon solved, however, as the steel frame was changed and it became strong enough to endure the added stress. Another reason that dirigibles could not be attached to the Empire State building is that dirigibles are highly flammable when they use hydrogen gas. It became apparent that if a dirigible were to catch fire in downtown New York it would be too terrible to risk. Dirigibles also couldn't be attached to the mast because the winds on top of the building would cause the back of the ship to ""swivel around and around the mooring mast"" and this would not be safe. Finally, dirigibles could not be moored to the Empire State building because ""the sharp spires of other buildings in the area [could] puncture the dirigible's shell"". The dirigibles could not fly so low without posing a risk to the people. Dirigibles could not land at the Empire State Building because there were too many dangers..Slight to believe, the absurd..Don't wanna close my eyes   I don't wanna fall asleep   'Cause I'd miss you baby   And I don't wanna miss a thing   Know what I was thinkin'   (What?).Everybody knows that freight trains are close to the track   And the truth is known that shoe soles are close to the tracks   Everybody knows that the sea shores are close to the sea   But there's yet to be for them to see   Things as close together as you and me..Up!.I just want to walk right out of this world,   Cause everybody has a poison heart,   Well, I just want to walk right out of this world,   Cause everybody has a poison heart..(chorus)   I've got friends in the states   I've got friends out in space   When information's your game   The whole world knows your name   And so they gave me a code   To work this treacherous road   For all the agents I know   Must work incognito..But we know what's really involved: dirty books are fun!.Well I gotta funny feeling   But I'm gonna stay cool   Something's telling me I'm   Gonna break all the rules   Let me tell ya I'm not insecure   But I gotta empty feeling   Think that you got the cure   You said it all, youve got to stay   To proud to fall, no more to say      Well I'm feeling sober but I'm high on the throne   Like a demon sick of sin and tired of being alone   I've made a bed that's hard to lie in   But if loving you is wrong can't do nothing but sin      You said it all, youve got to stay   To proud to fall, no more to say      You said it all, youve got to stay   To proud to fall, no more to say      Let them hang me, they would if they knew   Even half the things I've been doing with you   Walk me to the gallow and drop me to the floor   And watch me swinging and I still want more      You said it all, youve got to stay   To proud to fall, no more to say.You fly so high."
"The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced constructing a correct mooring mast for the zepplins, and concerning the safety of the people in the city. They also had to account for the weather and how it may have affected the blimps.      The builders had to add on more floors to the building and strengthen it's base so that the mast could work properly and stay stable. then they ruled out using weights to anchor the blimps in place because the people on the street below. Also the chemicals in the blimp were highly flamable and put people around at risk. Sometimes the winds were too strong for the blimps to get close enough without being punctured. The builders were faced with impossible obstacles to overcome.Two in the front seat and two in the back   And nothing good gonna come out of that   They living fast and rolling slow      Tiki tiki tiki tiki,   Waddup Holmes?.My daddy said the devil looks a lot like you      You take me to the edge of heaven   Tell me that my soul's forgiven   Hide you baby's eyes and we can...

"Based on the excerpt, the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there was a huge challenge for them to face. For example, mother nature itself was one of they're huge challenges they would mostly face. At the top of the Empire State Building, winds were constantly shifting and shifting due to violent air currents. As soon as an dirigible would hook up to the building, workers would have to find a way to keep they're airship from crashing into the building from the rusty winds at the top of the building. Therefore, if a dirigible- crashed anywhere on the ground it would burst into an inferno because the inside of a dirigible is filled with hydrogen and helium, so if it did crashed it will involve heat and fire that would be coming from the sparks it prevents as it crashes on the ground..They can play a bugle call like you never heard before,   So natural that you want to go to war--   That's just the bestest band what am, Honey Lamb!.So we both know   What we're still waiting for      Here we are   We're going through the motions   Doesn't mean   We're promising devotion   Don't ask me   Don't tell me, no   This is love      A cigarette is what I need   'Cause after this I should believe   This is love   Understand   That you'll have to tell your man   (So just tell him)      I just like kissing your lips   My darling girl   I know that's not what love is   So why can't I   Keep mine and you keep yours?.Lhuna, can't you hear how much I'm suffering?.Coming, coming winter's yearn,   Lords of Summer shall return..Meglio stasera   Baby go go go   Or as we natives say   ""Fa subito!"".I say: na na na na na na na na na na..Any anywhere you go,   Woman is the root of all evil..Take it easy, life goes on   My little backstage queen..Please, father don't be angry with me."
"The obstacles the builders of the empire State Building faced, was the lack of a suitable landing area.

" There were many obstacles faced when trying to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State building.One of these obstacles was the wind currents atop the building. They were uncontrolable, forceful and unexpected. In @CAPS1 @NUM1 it explains how a U.S. Navy dirigible attempted to dock but could not due to the winds, ""U.S. Navy dirigible Los Angeles approached the mooring mast but could not get close enough to tie up because of forceful winds"" (Lüsted) @CAPS2 the winds were an issue. Another problem was a law against airships that flew to low to the ground in urban areas. Not only was the idea dangerous, but it was also illegal. On May 6, 1937, a German dirigible called Hindenburg exploded in Lakehurst, New Jersey. This was due to the flammable hydrogen that was used to lift the dirigible. Since all dirigibles at this time obtained hydrogen another threat was introduced. This was the chance of it exploding while trying to dock on the Empire State Building. If it exploded while above numerous citizens, many lives would be in @CAPS3.

"Although the builders dream of using the Empire State Building as a dock for dirigibles was a brilliant one, the builders came across many problems. One problem was the law against flying too low over urban areas like New York City. Also, nature played a huge part in why their plan didnt work. The violent wind currents throughout the city affected the plan. Most dirigibles landed in open fields where their back end could be weighted down. This would be impossible docked to the building causing the dirigible to sway around possibly hitting other buildings. The builders didn't take into consideration how densely populated New York City is. If anything ever happened to a docked dirigible like the Hindenburg many people would be affected.

"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" author Marcia Amidon Lüsted speaks of the obsticles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. First, the frame of the Building had not been built to withstand a thousand foot long blimp docking to it. Therefore, changes would have to be made to make the building stronger. As the excerpt says, ""Over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework"". Also, having dirigibles dock to the building would be unsafe for many reasons. For example, dirigibles were often filled with hydrogen rather than helium, and as the excerpt points out ""hydrogen is highly flammable"" thus, the owners of the building realized that it could cause tragedy if a blimp were to crash while flying above New York's busy streets. Also, strong winds at the top of the building made it difficult and dangerous for blimps to dock at the mooring mast, because they would cause the back of the ship to constantly move. Finally, there were laws preventing aircrafts to fly so low over the city. There were many obsticles in allowing dirigibles to dock to the building..I know one thing this is true   I couldn't want anyone half as bad as you      You say that you want me   You say that you need me too   But you can't mean the words you say   The way I know I do   I said that I love you   I tell them you're mine   They just turn and walk away   It happens all the time   But I know they don't understand   Would you please just give me your hand   (Hand, hand, hand, hand...)

"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle was the law. There was ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas"" (¶ @NUM1). Although at first the builders looked past this, there were many other non-legal obstacles that they faced. There was also a safety issue with docking dirigibles, ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable"" (¶ @NUM2). One last obstacle the builders faced was the wind. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"" (¶ @NUM3).

"The builders of the Empire State building faced many problems in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Starting with putting a mooring mast on the top of the Empire State building. ""The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof"" (paragraph @NUM1). They had to modify the steel frame of the building. They had to do this all the way from the building's foundation, ""which was nearly eleven hundred feet below."" (paragraph @NUM1). This would cost more than sixty thousand dollars. Once the mooring mast was built the builders still encountered more problems. Dirigibles coming in from outside the @LOCATION2 ""used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable"" (paragraph @NUM3). So the flammable dirigibles were too dangerous to fly over such a populated place as New York City. Also the winds at the top of the Empire State Building were too strong. ""Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast"" (paragraph @NUM4). In the end the problems the builders faced were too many, and unfixable, so the docking of dirigibles in the Empire State Building was no more..Everybody has a little secret they keep inside and mine's   Livin' happily ever afterly   With you, with you      With you.And I hope there's someone who could tell me, come on,   Tell me why, oh tell me why   Oh baby tell me why love   Oh honey, why love is like   Well, it's like a ball   And   And a chain..I'm very close to far away   And I can't hear the words you say   So take what you can take what you find   Take it all into your mind      I'm very close to letting go   Even closer than you know   I need what you have need what you give   I need your love to make me live   So talk to me now talk to me slow   Say the words I told you so   I know you don't believe me   Or all the things I say   But if you'd just receive me   We're very close to far away      I'm very close to far away   And I can't hear the words you say   So take what you can take what you find   Take it all into your mind      I know you don't believe me   Or all the things I say   But if you'd just receive me   We're very close to far away   I'm very close to far away   And I can't hear the words you say   I need what you have need what you give   I need your love to make me live      I'm very close to letting go   Even closer than you know   So take what you can   Take what you find   Take it all into your mind.life is a fight between sources of evil and pure love..Someone's scratching at the window..Oh...

"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The first problem was the structure of the building, after the mast was designed they needed a building that could withstand the stress of the mast. ""Rather than building a utilitarian mast without any ornametation, the architects designed a shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel tower. They were able to overcome that obstacle. Another obstacle was safety. ""Most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium"" @CAPS1 obstacles did that bring? Well, hydrogen is highly flammable. When a German dirigible was destroyed by a fire in New Jersey, the owners of the ""Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area. The obstable brought upon another obstacle of practicality. Dirigibles customarily landed in open fields. ""The greatest obstacle to successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself. The winds on top of the building made it unsafe the only solution would be tethering the dirigible and weighing down the back with lead weights but using these at the building ""dangling high over pedestrians on the street was neither practical nor safe"".

"There were many obstacles that the @CAPS1 of the Empire State Building faced one of them were redesigning some parts of the Empire State Building. The @CAPS1 job was to create the mast for docking new airships called dirigible or blimps. This plan came with great difficulty, they couldn't drop on mooring mass on top of the Empire State buildings flat roof. They came to figure out that a ""thousand-foot dirigible moored held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the buildings frame"" (paragraph @NUM1). This stress would have to be transmitted to the buildings foundation.

"Builders of the Empire State Building faceD many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. When designing the mast, they didn't realize that the mast ""would add stress to the building's frame"" and in order to fix this problem, they would have to pay ""over sixty thousand Dollars' worth"" for modifications for the building's framework.      Another problem they encountereD, besides the fact that there was ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas,"" ""the winds on the top of the building were constantly shifting."" This did not allow dirigibles to be able to get close enough to dock, in fear that the ""wind would blow the dirigible onto sharp spires,"" which would damage the dirigible's shell.      An alternate problems faceD by builders was realized when the Hindenburg was destroyeD in New Jersey, due to the fact that ""hydrogen is extremely flammable."" They realized how unsafe it be to have an accident like that ""above a densely populateD area."" AnD so, builders were forceD to stop their work..These things happen   Love never comes with a guarantee   No hard meetings   But it looks like this love was never meant to be      That's easy for you to say   You've got another who's willing and waiting for you   That's easy for you to say   You're not the one with the heart that's breaking in two   You tell me it's better this way   That's easy for you to say      There'll be changes   Times never been known to ever stand still   Lonely losers   Hold to a promise they'll never fulfill      That's easy for you to say   You've got another who's willing and waiting for you   That's easy for you to say   You're not the one with the heart that's breaking in two   You tell me it's better this way   That's easy for you to say      You tell me you know hat it's wrong   To walk out this way   But in time my true love will come   And I'll thank you some day      That's easy for you to say   You've got another who's willing and waiting for you   That's easy for you to say   You're not the one with the heart that's breaking in two   You tell me it's better this way   That's easy for you to say   That's easy for you to say.What are you takin' for beauty's sake?.And if you even think of runnin away I'll bash your fuckin' skull with a lead pipe!.Well, I know that I may have had my share   Of failing and falling   But I have come to understand   One thing remains   By all he's done, I have been made holy   Worthy of serving the one   The one who wrote eternity   So deep in my heart   Open your eyes and see   The wonder of a life so wonderfully free   Lift up your head, believe   There is more, there's so much more to see, yeah   You remind me still of the hope and promise   Daring my heart to be brave   And all the while You strengthen me   So deep in my heart   Open your eyes and see   The wonder of a life so wonderfully free   Lift up your head, believe   There is more, there's so much more   Lift up your head, believe   There is more, there's so much more to see, yeah   So much more   His mercies are new every morning   His mercies are new every day   His mercies are new every morning   Beautifully new every day   His mercies are new every morning   His mercies are new every day   His mercies are new every morning   Beautifully new every day   His mercies are new every morning   His mercies are new every day   His mercies are new every morning   Beautifully new every day   Open your eyes and see   The wonder of a life so wonderfully free   Lift up your head, believe   There is more, there's so much more   Open your eyes and see   The wonder of a life so wonderfully free   Lift up your head, believe   There is more, there's so much more to see, yeah   Lift up your eyes and see   Lift up your eyes and see   Lift up your eyes and see   Lift up your eyes and see   Lift up your eyes and see   Lift up your eyes and see   Lift up your eyes and see   Lift up your eyes and see.No hate or spite..I said, ""No, I just think it would be sexy and kinda fly""   She said, ""Well I don't""   I said, ""Well if I let you pick the girl, would that make a difference?"".Donde esta Santa Claus?.When you living inna fame   You got to live up to your name   Or else you suffer and you die inna shame   It's all in the game, eh!.The things that I used to do Lord, I won't do no more   The things that I used to do Lord, I won't do no more   I used to sit and hold your hand darlin' and cry, oh babe do not go      I used to search all night for you darlin'   Lord, and my search would always end in vain   I used to search all night for you darlin'   Lord, and my search would always end in vain   But I knew all the time darlin' That you was hid out wit' your other man      I'm goin' to send you back to your mama darlin'   Lord, and I'm goin' back to my family too   I'm goin' to send you back to your mama darlin'   Lord, and I'm goin' back to my family too   Nothin' I can do to please ya' darlin' I just can't get along with you"

"Based on the excerpt the builders of the Empire State Building were faced with many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Some of the obstacles were safty factors and nature its self.Safty was a big obstacle in this plan for a morning mast because the dirigibles use hydrogen to float these big ships. Hydrogen is highly flammable and the owners of the Empire State Building relized how bad it would be if the dirigibles were to cech of fire over a highly populated city like New York. ""Most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. When the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, May 6, 1937, the owners relized how much worse that accident could have been in New York.""The greatest obstacle was nature. Humans couldn't control wind and ontop of the building they were constantly changeing makeing it hard to dock. ""The winds ontop of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents.""

"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles. The dirigibles weren't safe in a city like New York because of violent wind currents at the top of the building that would make the dirigibles ""swivel around and around the mooring mast."" Also many blimps from outside the United States were filled with hydrogen, which is highly flammable. If there was an accident like the Hindenburg in New York, more than just the passengers would be harmed. Another obstacle was that there was a law forbidding airships to fly too low over urban areas. This law made it illegal for ships to even go near the Empire State Building..Wasted, wanted, needed, feel,   When all is said and done..And the passion never dies   Oh dreamy eyes   No matter how I try   I just can't reach you, dreamy eyes..You help to keep the devil away..And now the air is clear, my dear and you're still here and so   A certain surprise, give you my sweet certain surprise   Silence has never been my thing   I'm one of those, I love to shout and sing about my love   Sweet flying dove, there's no one above, sweet certain surprise      Soft and certain, tell the moon?.Promise I'll be here forever I swear..It's irregular and it sure won't pay   but say naught 'til you got something to say   So I live for forty minutes a day   Can I have that?.or is it that I'm missing something?.Come with me   On a journey beneath the skin   Come with me   On a journey under the skin      We will look together   For the Pan within   Close your eyes   Breathe slow we'll begin      Close your eyes   Breathe slow we'll begin   To look together   For the Pan within      Swing your hips   Loose your head and let it spin   Swing your hips   Loose your head and let it spin      And we will look together for the Pain within   Close your eyes   Breathe slow we'll begin   Close your eyes   Breathe slow we'll begin   To look together   For the Pain within      Put your face to my window   Breathe a night full of treasure   The wind is delicious   Sweet and wild with the promise of pleasure      The stars are alive   And nights like these   Were born to be   Sanctified by you and me   Lovers thieves fools and pretenders      And all we gotta do is surrender   Come with me on a journey   Under the skin   Come with me on a journey under the skin   And we will look together   For the Pain within.My friend, my friend he's got a knife   A statement from his former life   When he was easy but alone   Beside him was an empty throne   But what of silver silken blade   Affix his gaze, his features staid   Grasps the handle, clips the cable   One steps up, sits at his table   My friend, my friend, he's got a knife   My friend, my friend, he's got a wife      My friend, my friend, the clever ruse   Persuasion through his thoughts peruse   A hidden relic from his past   That wasn't there when he looked last   He feels it ticking like a bomb   Feeding fear, assaulting calm   Takes the object, starts the game   Moves closer to the flame      My friend, my friend, the clever ruse   My friend, my friend, he lights the fuse      My friend, my friend, he's got a knife   My friend, my friend, he's got a knife   My friend, my friend, he's got a knife"
"Based on the excerpt the builders of the Empire State Building faced problems such as to much wind movement, to much weight, and to many safty risks. when they attempted to allow dirigibles to dock there.The wind movement would move the dirigibles around when trying to dock so they would have troubles with that. They would also have weight problems because they didn't have a stable enough frame around the building. They would have to pay alot of money to fix this problem.The last problem was a safety problem. After the German dirigible Hindenburg blew up they realized that it was way to dangerous to have blimps landing over crowded cities It was also a flying law of airships not being able to go that low over a city.This is why the builders had faced so many problems..Touche d'amour   Touche d'amour   Touche d'amour   Touche d'amour   Oh..Someday I will make it right..I looked at it like a blessing   And now it's just a curse   I don't know why   I don't know why      [Chorus]   It's you, it's you   It's you, it's you   It's you.Nothing, nothing, never gonna tell, tell, tell, tell..Johnny's begging pretty please   (Keep the brother on his knees)   Keep the brother on his knees   (Hee hee!).You are desire   Everything you need, I give you right or wrong   And you are the woman that I base my whole existence on   And when I get to you my desire is glowing in your light      And it's nice to light a fire when it's cold outside   If you give it all away   Make it mine..Hey!).I cry the whole night, just for you   My tears will dry, that is true   But I can't live without you one more day   You're always in my heart, I swear   And if you call, I'll be there   But I can't live without you one more night   And I promise I will touch the sky   If you ask me baby I will die   Oh babe I saved my life only for you      It's your smile, what makes my heartbeat fast   It's your smile, and it will last   I know, that you the one for me   It's your smile, I can never let you go   It's your smile, it always shows   I know, that you're the one for me      You mean everything to me   Day in day out you're a mystery   And I can't live without you one more day   And everyday is a new day   And I can't sleep, to see you stay   Before my eyes my love can't let you go   And I promise I will catch a star   Move a mountain, even I know so far   Oh babe I saved my life only for you.Illinois, oh, Illinois."
"During the attempt to allow dirigibles to dock in the Empire State Building, builders faced many obstacles. One of these obstacles was to modify the whole frame of the building. ""A thousand- foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame... The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation."" This quote from the excerpt cleary shows that the builders would have to move around this to complete their job, which would entirely make this situation an obstacle. Another obstacle faced by the workers was nature itself. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" This quote shows another obstacle because builders could not find a practical way to get the passengers off, and putting lead in the back would only endanger the pedestrians below. The final obstacle the builders faced was the safety of everyone. ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" This quote shows a very big obstacle, which actually happened to the German dirigible Hindenburg. Those were the obstacles that were faced by the workers during the time of attempting to dock dirigibles on the Empire State Building..Sweet pushcarts gently gli-ding by..You think that you could love me, Mary?.Hard living, every day of my life   Hard living, every night on the wine      Never givin', any one any time   Always losin', all I had all the time      Yes I'm a selfish kinda man   All I need is a helping hand      Bad loser, never had anyone   Bad chooser, never owed never won      Fast mover, everyday on the run   Never knowing, if I feel or I'm done      Hard living, every day of my life   Hard drinking, every night on the wine.I must admit   It's far too late to dial police      What is your name?.We must have played   For more than ten years   We must have thought   That we're immortal   Shame, shame on us,   Ah little hussy,   What did you think I was   I look at us   We have grown older   A lot too much   For me to take   I thought   We were immortal   I'm so sorry   I couldn't keep my promise   To carry on your flag for you   Some superhero-being      It seems to me   That we are changing   There ain't no limit to imagination   The world just turns around   Without a care   Sometimes I feel like crying   And every time   I need to touch you   How can I ever   Break the distance   That's why my love   Became so strong and pure   That's why I keep on   Trying forever   To carry on your flag for you   Some superhero-being   For you   Some superhero-being   Waiting   Under the light of the moon   For you   I'm coming soon..""How ya doin' girls?.You'll find that life is still worthwhile   If you just smile.She's a good girl, loves her mama   loves Jesus and America too   She's a good girl, crazy 'bout Elvis   loves horses and her boyfriend too      It's a long day livin' in Reseda   there's a freeway runnin' through the yard   and I'm a bad boy, 'cause I don't even miss her   I'm a bad boy for breakin' her heart      And I'm free, I'm free fallin'      All the vampires walkin' through the valley   move west down Ventura Blvd..Hey boys, Miss Magic is back   No Hollywood waste or tinsel trash   Street kid, she's no stray cat   Heaven on legs she's feline flash   Takes a good woman to play a good man   And no one plays like heaven can      She said leave your name   At the sound of the tone   Call you right back   When I get home   Better watch out   When we're all alone      Heaven is a girl I know so well   She makes me feel good when I feel like hell   Heaven is a girl that I've got to have   She makes me feel better when I'm feelin' bad      Hey guys, Miss Magic is mine   No silicone smile she's a vintage wine   Bombshell blond, red lipstick on   Aquiline fine, she's a real wild one      She said leave your name   At the sound of the tone   Call you right back   When I get home   Better watch out   When we're all alone      [Chorus]   Heaven is a girl I know so well   She makes me feel good when I feel like hell   Heaven is a girl that I've got to have   She makes me feel better when I'm feelin' bad   Heaven is a girl that makes dreams come true   Oh, no one does it good like heaven do, no      She got the rhythm to drive me crazy   She got the rhythm of love      She said leave your name   At the sound of the tone   The lights are out   But there's somebody home   Better watch out when   We're all alone      [Chorus]      Heaven is a girl that I've got to have   She makes me feel good when I feel like hell   Heaven is a girl she makes dreams come true   And no one does it good like heaven do   That voodoo that you do"
"Builders had many obstacles to overcome when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building. One obstacle was the lack of suitable landing area. This obstacle did not stop Al Smith, he saw this as an oppertunity to add a mooring mast at the top of the building so dirigibles could anchor there. This idea caused another obstacle, a mooring mast could not possibley be dropped on top of the roof of the building. The stress of the load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the buildings foundation. With this the steel frame of the building would have to be modified and strengthened costing @MONEY1 just to change the framework. In the end this mooring mast to dock dirigibles never came through and archetects should have seen the potential problems in the beginning..Where your heart wants to play   And your feet want to dance,   Where the close of each day   Brings a night of romance..Someone who could make her lips so warm   That my lonely heart could brave each storm   Someone who'd be miles away, still within her heart I'd stay   Beats there a heart so true?.I'm starting with the man in the mirror   (Oh yeah!).Big time!.Slip away..Did you flip yo' wig   To let Michael Jackson baby sit yo' kids?.Why don't you live up there?.And I guess you could say it took california to bring us close..Featuring P.J."
"The builders of the Empire State building, who wished to place a mooring mast at the top of the building, faced many obstacles in their attempts to allow dirigibles to dock there. One such obstacle was safety. Most dirigibles at the time used highly flammable hydrogen, and should a single spark enter the balloon, the entire dirigible would catch fire. Eventually, the owners of the Empire State Building realized how [harmful an] accident could [be] if it [took] place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York,"" and halted construction of the mooring mast. Another obstacle was that ""the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents,"" which would cause the dirigible to ""swivel around and around the mooring mast."" A third reason was that, even should there be some way of holding the dirigible still against all that air pressure, all the stress of holding that dirigible still ""would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation."" All these problems contributed to the mooring mast's fate disuse..[Man:] ""All right!.I'm dipping in the 362 with the 57   Soon as she get in here she put ht e flip on the zipper   I'm dipping with it, I can tickle your kitty with it   [?].Psst, hey, come on man, wake up..Spark and Cindy live by their own means   They wouldn't have if I only   Know'd where they'd been   And I want to make things a part of my life   And I want to see that   Things are going to be right   But if you can't even   Stand on your feet   And if you don't own the   Air that you breathe   Then it's not for me to say      But I wouldn't live that way   And I wouldn't stand apart   And I wouldn't find the real   And I wouldn't play a part   And I wouldn't find in love   So misguided by some fool   And just what I'm trying t say   Makes my head spin round the room      (Repeats from 3rd line onwards).What was I to say?.When he passed away i smoked and drank all day,   Alone..Have you ever been experienced?.Go 'way from my window   Leave at your own chosen speed   I'm not the one you want, babe   I'm not the one you need   You say you're lookin' for someone   Who's never weak but always strong   To protect you an' defend you   Whether you are right or wrong   Someone to open each and every door   But it ain't me, babe   No, no, no, it ain't me babe   It ain't me you're lookin' for, babe..Yeah I'm ready for it."
"In this excerpt there were obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building. The obstacles they face were the dirigible and the sucess of the mooring mast. The dirigible were enormous steel framed balloons, with envelopes of cotton fabric. filled with hydrogen and helium to make it lighter than air. unlike the balloon, a dirigible could be maneuvered by the use of propellers and rudders. like a gandala. Another obstacle is the sucessful use of the mooring mast. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air current. It could also weight down and dangle above the pedestrians wasn't safe. All in all these were the obstacles they had to face..Here's what I found out..Well I'm beginning to see the light..(oh Monica my love.).Somewhere   We'll find a new way of living   We'll find a way of forgiving   Somewhere....All you've got to show, you may never know, what you are   If you ever try, can you tell me why, why you are   Only you will know, and you picked your show,   Can you tell me though, will you know?.Well business, the business is good..now..You'll be lovin' me alright, until your dyin' day..No, I can't stop rockin   no matter what they do do do do do or say."

"The @CAPS1 of the @ORGANIZATION1 many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One problem was the law. There was a law in place preventing airships flying too low over urban cities. This made it illegal for airships to tie up to the building or even come close to the area. Another isue they had was that dirigibles were filled with hydrogen, not helium Hydrogen is extremely flammable and it would be catastrophic if a dirigible blew up over New York City. The last problem they @ORGANIZATION1 was the wind. At the top of the building the winds shifted due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigibles were tied up the back end would move around.

"In the excerpt from ""The Mooring Mast"" By Marcia Amidon Lüsted, the builders of the empire state building faced several obstacles in the attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. One of the obstacles they faced was the fact that there was a lack of suitable landing area. The dirigibles were thought to be able to anchor on the mooring mast for refueling or service, however, another obstacle was in the way; nature. That was the greatest obstacle. The wind at the top of the building were always shifting because of violent air currents. The builders were afraid that the back of the ship would ""swivel around and around the mooring mast"" With that said, they came to a conclusion that they would be ""dangling high above pedestrians on the street [which] was neither practical or safe. In order for it to be safe, they came to another obstacle. The entire building would have to be modified and strengthened with over @NUM1 dollars worth of investment. Lastly, there already stood a law against airships flying too low over urban areas.

"Architects designing the Empire State Building with the intent of docking zeppelins to it at heights of over @NUM1 feet no doubt had a lot to go through. According to ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION2, obstacles included adding stress to the buildings frame with a blimp attached, and the design of the mooring mast itself. The article says that ""the stress of the dirigibles load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation"" in order to make docking safe. The mooring mast was composed mostly of steel. Other problems facing architects was the wind factor, and keeping zeppelins immobile in the ""constantly shifting"" and ""violent air currents"" at @NUM2 feet. Safety hazards also came into account, because architects realized that should another accident like the Hindenburg's occur again in New York City, results could be disastrous.

"Based on the excerpt, The Mooring Mast, the obsticles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there was how would they be able to have thousand foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, without ""adding stress to the building framework."" They couldn't just add the mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof because ""the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have been transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven thousand feet below."" @CAPS1 they had to find a solution, which was to modify and strengthen the steel frame of the Empire State Building. Costing over sixty thousand dollars' worth modifications to the building's framework. Also ""rather than building a utilitarian mast with any ornamentation, they built a shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel tower that would be illuminated from inside,"" make the 101st floor a glassed-in observation area and the @NUM1 floor an open observation platform..What makes the in-between so rough?.I'm ready, ready as anybody can be   I'm ready, ready as anybody can be   Now I'm ready for you, I hope you're ready for me      I got an axe handle pistol built on a graveyard frame   Shootin' tombstone bullets, wearin' ball and chain   I'm drinkin' tnt, smokin' dynamite, I hope some screwball   Start a fight      I'm ready, ready as anybody can be   Now I'm ready for you, I hope you're ready for me      All you pretty little chicks with your pretty little   Hair,   I know you think that I ain't nowhere   But stop what your doin' an' look over here,   I'll prove to ya, baby, that I ain't no square      I'm ready, ready as anybody can be   Now I'm ready for you, I hope you're ready for me      I been drinkin' gin like never before   I feel so good, babe, I want you to know   One more drink, and I wish you would   I takes a whole lotta lovin' to make me feel good, 'cause      I'm ready, ready as anybody can be   Now I'm ready for you, I hope you're ready for me.Electric eel   Swimming through the seas of the unreal   Trying to land a deal for you to reinvent the wheel   Electric eel      Electric eye   Pull the plug, watch him die   I did not even cry, I guess you know the reasons why   Electric eye      Was I supposed to go down with the ship?.Revelation, the chosen saved   Earth be cleansed in a blaze..Whatever became of you, Hubert?.Ow!.I once held her in my arms   She said she would always stay   But I was cruel and treated her like a fool   I threw it all away      One side's mountains in the palm of my hand   Rivers that ran through everyday   Now I must've been mad or I never knew what I had   I threw it all away      Love is all there is   And it makes the world go round   Love and only love it can't be denied   No matter what you think about it   You won't be able to live without it   Take a tip from one who's tried      So if you find someone   Who gives you all of their love   Take it to your heart   Don't let it stray   Because one thing is for certain   You'll surely be hurting   If you thow it all away   Just don't throw it all away.Hush my darling , sleep my lover   There'll be rain till we run for cover   Lost in love in a world of strangers   Something only the lord arranges   Oh my darling , now I found you   Want to live all my life around you   You're my light in a world of sorrow   Scared of losing this dream tomorrow   I just want to hold you forever , forever   Loving one another that's how it should be   Needing you beside me , together , no never   Try to rediscover no other but me   Oh my darling , if you leave me   I lose the love that has always freed me   Not knowing angel , what's coming after   Never hearing you're golden laughter   Oh my baby , hearts like thunder   Can't escape from the spell I'm under   I surrender to all your treasure   Endless nights of pain and pleasure   I just want to hold you , forever , forever   Loving one another , that's how it should be   Needing you beside me , together , no never   Try to rediscover no other but me   (break)   I just want to hold you , forever , forever   Loving one another , that's how it should be   Needing you beside me , together , no never   Try to rediscover no other but me   (repeat last verse and fade out ).But every day's a holiday   When I'm near to you."
"Although the plans for the mooring mast were optimistic, there were many obstacles that kept that plan from becoming a reality. The first  reason why builders difficulty allowing dirigibles to dock was because of safety. The helium that filled the balloons was highly flammable. If one were to catch fire, it would be a danger to all of New York City. Secondly, the high winds made it unsafe for the dirigibles. Paragraph @NUM1 states, ""Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around..."". Lastly, the builders faced the obstacle of pre- existing laws when trying to allow dirigibles to dock on the mooring mast. An existing law stated that aircraft couldn't fly too low over urban areas. These three main obstacles were face by the builders of the Empire State Building. The mooring mast never became a reality because of these obstacles..Verse 1:   You were the one, the one in my dreams, but I never knew it   I wanted to tell you, time and again, but I couldn't do it   All that you, are is all that I need, no more predending   Now I can be me, you can be you, and we never ending      Chorus:   We'll be together, always together, like birds of a feather   Forever and ever, we'll be together      Verse 2:   I like what you got, I guess it's okay if you want to show it   I am what I am, and I'm over you, just want you to know it   Will I ever score?.[Repeat: x2]   All I want to do is make the whole crowd bounce y'all      It's structures to this game, it's instinct mixed with knowledge   I'm a player in the game and I know not from college   Eyes open, focus, scopin out the scene   Watch the gangsta haters close 'cause they worse than dope fiends   I hope things get better for you   Cause I'ma make things get better for me   And keep the Doggystyle hottest thing out the LB   The L-L-G wit DPG by the sea   We ride at high tide, the East is my side   I'ma tell you 'long as my voice is recordable   That plan you got ain't gonna work you better audible   Oh yes I'm fresh and like spy from existence   Wit persistence I perceive   To supply you wit what you need, no room for greed   Better go around and when it come to you   Don't bite off more than you can chew   Respect the game and the game will respect you back   Game is life, life is struggle   Without the coastal juggle   So if you drop I test that, fragile as a crsytal   (Will you get mad and go pull out your pistol?).Burning down the house..Well, as simple as that   Hollywood movie girls   Oh, star light, star bright, won't you wish on me tonight?.Got the wings of heaven on my shoes,   I'm a dancin' man and I just can't lose..""Do you doodle all day?"".This is a mean old world, try and live it by yourself..Take my heart and my soul!.So pray then, if it makes you feel safe   All I can say is we go are own way      So pray then, if it makes you feel safe   All I can say is we go are own way   We go are own way   So save us      Over and over and I still can not believe   We can't save ourselves   Give me a chance up on the cross and watch me bleed."
"In the excerpt, some obstacles they faced were that the building was the tallest in the world at 1,250 ft. like it says in paragraph @NUM1. Another problem they encountered was the dirigibles were unsafe. The Hindenburg, an event where a helium filled dirigible had caught fire, occured during construction. What if one of their dirigibles caught fire over New York. The whole idea of dirigibles was thought of as dangerous. Finally, there were laws saying that no aircraft could be that close to the city. The whole idea of the ""future of travel"" was very unliked and impractical..why can't I love you, baby?.As good as you've been to this whole wide world,   As good as you've been, babe,   So good I want to be here..Sinner!.Without compassion, there can be no end to hate   No end to sorrow   Caused by the same endless fears   Why can't we learn from all we've been through   After two thousand years?.Mmm..Right   Lights, camera, action   I want to be his sole distraction      Cupid draw your bow   Shoot it nice and slow   Send it straight to his heart   Love don't let him go   You must let him know   This is love from the start      (Chorus):   Say a little prayer   Say a little prayer for me tonight   Say a little prayer   Say a little prayer for my hear tonight      Mama always told me   (sometimes)   What you get is not what you see   I'm not taking any chances   No more broken romances      Cupid draw your bow fetch   (Chorus x2)   I promise to always love and care for him   And I promise...to do my very best for him   I promise...to cherish him for all of my life      I promise...to always love and care for him   And I promise...I'll always be there for him   I promise...to love him for the rest of my life      (Chorus out)..See, we are as tall as women!.All this time the river flowed..It's been a long, been a long long time   Since I held anybody, since I loved anyone."
"The obstacles builders faced were weather, hight of the structure, stability of the structure, and worriying about the highly flamable gases from the dirigible. The weather affected having the dirigible dock there because the winds could whip it around, knocking it into nearby buildings. The structure needs to be stable at it's hight so the dirigible doesn't knock over the empire state building. The author Marcia Amidon @CAPS1 states, ""The steel frame of the Empire State building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation,"" this was nessisary so the dirigible wouldn't knock over the Empire State Building, wiping out a lot of New York. The highly flammable gases would need to be under intense supervision, because if they caught of fire the Empire State Building and pedestrians, and downtown New York would catch of fire. These reasons are the obstacles they faced and why a mooring mast was never completed and used..We are the wreckin' crew..Oh, the shark has pretty teeth, dear   And it shows them pearly white   Just a jackknife has MacHeath, babe   And it keeps it way out of sight   When that shark bites with his teeth, dear   Scarlet billows begin to spread   Fancy gloves, wears old MacHeath, babe   So there's never, never a trace of red      On the sidewalk, one Sunday mornin   Lies a body oozin' life   Someone's sneakin' round that corner   Could that someone be Mack the Knife?.Where you find it..How many will you take?.Silent night surrounding me   On the shore of wistful sea   A kindest heart made me believe   The world as I wish it to be      Wind in the wheat   Kiss by a hearth   Little hideaways for a lonely heart      Cast away in beauty's gloom   The good in me, the child within   A cruelest heart made me forget   The world as I wish it to be      Home inside but lost for life   Human heart longing for love   Slave to the toil, this mortal coil   The strife, the suffering, the void      Wind in the wheat   Kiss by a hearth   A dead calm winter morn,   Morning birds, and a smile of a stranger      Frozen moments in time   Little hideaways, the marrow of life   Little hideaways for a lonely heart      Wind in the wheat   Kiss by a hearth   Little hideaways for a lonely heart      Silent night surrounding me   On the shore of wistful sea   A kindest heart made me believe   The world as I wish it to be..Lord I'm leavin', yeah I'm leavin' this mornin'   Goin' to kansas city to bring jim jackson home..Savin' all your money   For a rainy day limousine   Teenage baby send you   Full friction magazine   I don't know how she do it      Up down turnaround   Four on the floor tonight   When she did what she was doin'   She was rubbin' me the wrong way right   Push come to shove   Give it one more try   Don't miss your water   Until the well runs dry      Love Me Like A Birddog   Never Learn to Fly      Bareback baby   Tell me what's on your mind   If it's the same old same old   Slap you on the back behind   I don't know how you do it   Tell me one time   About how it used to be   You got the judge and jury   Swinging from the highest tree   Push came to shove   Give it one more try   Don't miss your water   Until the well runs dry      Love Me Like a Bird Dog   Never learn to fly   Ask me no questions   I'll tell you no lies      Love Me Like a Bird Dog   Never learn to fly   Ask me no questions      Bass drum beating   Like a hot damn house on fire   Love lover's quarrels   Always seem to make the body cry   I don't know how she do it   Tell me one time   About how it used to be   She got the judge and jury   Swinging from the highest tree   Push came to shove   Give it one more try   You don't miss your water   Until the well runs dry      Love Me Like a Bird Dog   Never learn to fly   Ask me no questions   I'll tell you no lies.Well you get down the fiddle and you get down the bow   Kick off your shoes and you throw them on the floor   Dance in the kitchen 'till the morning light   Louisiana Saturday Night      Waitin' in the front yard, sittin' on a log   A single shot rifle and a one-eyed dog   Yonder come our kin-folk in the moonlight   Louisiana Saturday Night      Well you get down the fiddle and you get down the bow   Kick off your shoes and you throw them on the floor   Dance in the kitchen 'till the morning light   Louisiana Saturday Night      My brother Bill and my other brother Jack   Barrel full of beer and a possum in a sack   Fifteen kids in the front porch light   Louisiana Saturday Night      When the kin-folk leave and the kids get fed   Me and my woman gonna slip off to bed   Have a little fun when we turn out the lights   Louisiana Saturday Night      Well you get down the fiddle and you get down the bow   Kick off your shoes and you throw them on the floor   Dance in the kitchen 'till the morning light   Louisiana Saturday Night (x3).How's your fern?"
"The idea of using a mooring mast in order to allow dirigibles to dock at the top of the Empire State Building was never a practical one. This is due to the many struggles that were faced when Al Smith's team was attempting to create a mooring mast that would serve the purpose of docking dirigibles. such obstacles included; the pressure a docked dirigible would have on the building itself, the hazards of high winds causing the dirigible to be shaken violently, the chance of the dirigible catching on fire due to the flamibility of the hydrogen if in it, and the close proximity the dirigible would have to other buildings in the area The first problem faced during the development of the mooring mast was the stress of the heavyweight of the dirigible would put on the building. ""The steel frame of the [building] would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate [the added pressure from the dirigible]."" The dirigible's weight was not the only thing that put stress on the building, the wind pressure would also. The wind made it difficult for creating a mooring mast's structure because it would not only add pressure to the building because the dirrigible itself to not be able to stay in one place ""Even if the dirrigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" An accident that could occur would be a fire due to possible flamibility. And since the dirrigible is so close to people, such as tourist on the building's observation deck, the dirrigible catching on fire (if it's filled with hydrogen instead of helium) could be more disastrous than if it landed in an open field. Lastly,  the dirigibleis so close to urban areas that it is illegal for such airships to dock or even fly at such proximity.  For example, when the Los Angeles tested  the docking process to the mooring mast of the Empire State Building it ""could not get close enough to tie up because of forceful winds."" All of these were major obstacles to the building process of the Empire State Building and it's mooring mast for docking dirigibles. These are also the reasons why the architects of the Empire State Building came to the conclusion that such a structure would not be practical to construct..How can we be lovers if we can't be, can't be friends?.Yeah, I found an angel,   I found my place..and know (we know!).Live it up, and let it go   Your time is up before you know   In a world full of wonder   Don't let your troubles pull you under      You're telling me your life is tough   And what you need is stronger stuff   Well you can live under sedation   Or get up and cause an overnight sensation      Whoa, live it up   Life is what you make it   Whoa, live it up   It's right there for you to take it      You sit and watch your MTV   You dream away in a fantasy   If you don't dig the situation   Then get a guitar and rock the nation      You can't hold back once you light the fuse   And if it feels alright, then let it roll   You got nothin' to lose      Whoa, live it up   Life is what you make it   Whoa, live it up   It's right there for you to take it.But I didn't get lost cause I saw your light..[Chorus:]   [Bridge:] The thing that everyone says about that shit today I am not the One who is gay..Doomed from the start   We met with a goodbye kiss, I broke my wrist   It all kicked off, I had no choice   You said that you didn't mind 'cause love's hard to find   Maybe the days we had are gone, living in silence for too long   Open your eyes and what do you see?.I can't play these games with you no more   I get my fingers caught inside the door   Now everything I say is just a joke   Spend my money now you leave me broke   Living someone's life in clear blue skies   Fairy tales and dreams and alibis   All you want from me are things for you   Use me til I don't know what to do   You live in your own world anyway   Twisting every single thing I say   In my hometown I feel out of place   Change my name and find a different face      You tell me   No more cool Mr..Why seek the truth when the truth is within?"
"Although there were great hopes for the attempt to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building, many obstacles were faced while trying to reach this dream. One obstacle noticed while designing the mast to dock on, was that the height and weight of a dirigible would greatly add stress to the building's frame. This would then be transmitted to the building's foundation as well. This clearly possessed a problem bigger than the Empire State Building could withstand. Another reason that builders faced an obstruction in the hopes of allowing dirigibles to dock was safety reasons. One of the most apparent problems, was that most dirigibles outside of the @LOCATION2 were fueled by hydrogen gas, opposed to helium gas. This posed a threat, for hydrogen is highly flammable. Putting a densely populated area such as downtown New York at risk consequently came as an obstacle for builders. The nature itself came as one of the last problems for such a dream. Winds that were constantly shifting due to extreme air currents, at the top of the building could easily cause the back of the dirigible to spin around the mooring mast. Again putting thousands of people below the building, was neither practical nor safe."" As quoted by the passage, ""the mooring mast of the Empire State Building was never destined to fulfill its purpose..."", clearly posing many obstacles in allowing to dock dirigibles on such a building..I feel so unsure   As I take your hand and lead you to the dance floor   As the music dies, something in your eyes   Calls to mind the silver screen   And all it's sad goodbyes      I'm never gonna dance again   Guilty feet have got no rhythm   Though it's easy to pretend   I know you're not a fool      Should've known better than to cheat a friend   And waste the chance that I've been given   So I'm never gonna dance again   The way I danced with you      Time can never mend   The careless whispers of a good friend   To the heart and mind   Ignorance is kind   There's no comfort in the truth   Pain is all you'll find      I'm never gonna dance again   Guilty feet have got no rhythm   Though it's easy to pretend   I know you're not a fool      I should've known better than to cheat a friend   And waste the chance that I've been given   So I'm never gonna dance again   The way I danced with you      Never without your love      Tonight the music seems so loud   I wish that we could lose this crowd   Maybe it's better this way   We'd hurt each other with the things we'd want to say      We could have been so good together   We could have lived this dance forever   But now who's gonna dance with me   Please stay      And I'm never gonna dance again   Guilty feet have got no rhythm   Though it's easy to pretend   I know you're not a fool      Should've known better than to cheat a friend   And waste the chance that I've been given   So I'm never gonna dance again   The way I danced with you      (Now that you're gone) Now that you're gone   (Now that you're gone) What I did's so wrong, so wrong   That you had to leave me alone.Ooh, I need your lovin'   I know   Got me on pins and needles   Yes, she knows she's mine and ain't lettin' go   So this is love?.Step into the fantasy   You'll never want to leave, baby it's guarantee   Why?.The protein pills and the G-strings you left in her flat   Are just enough to get your Dewey Decimal back   You lift her to work, just before your daily workout begins   And she'll stack up like you stack vitamins   Did you ever never wanna let somebody down?.We had been told of a place,   Far beyond this vale of tears..Holy Spirit, Touch Your people   Teach us the ways of God   And as we live, As Jesus did   You are honored and lifted up   There's a stirring in the Spirit   There's an urgency in this hour   We as children must obey   Can you hear   The footsteps of God   God is moving, God is moving   Can you hear the sound   Of revival   As we praise You, as we sing   Draw near to us O God   As we cry out for the nations   Pour out revival in the land   There's a stirring in the Spirit   There's an urgency in this hour   We as children must obey   Can you hear   The footsteps of God.Good morning beautiful, how was your night?.'Cause this little girl, this little girl, she's a driving me wild   She's a driving me wild, so wild, so wild, so wild.In the darkness of my dreaming   The light of you will stay."
"well, since this one obstacle in their expanded use in New York City was the lack of landing area For the dirigibles. So, Al Smith decided to add a mooring mast on top of the Empire State building to allow these dirigibles to anchor there to get gas for several hours and also service. And to let the passengers on and off there also. The Dirigibles were docked by an electric winch, which hauled in a line From the front of ship then tied to the Mast.

" In building the mast and docking to the empire state building the constructers faced major problems. The Idea of a dock for dirigibles was a good idea at the time but faced both structrial and social problems. Architects and stated that over time the dock for the dirigible and climatic change would cause strain on the framework of the building. This led to more reconstruction and economic spendings. Another problem the builders faced was the location of the building itself. Newly built dirigibles had hydrogen rather than helium which led to flamibility. The Hindenburg was destroyed in a fire which led the builders to consider what would happened if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York. Docking of dirigibles led to many obstacles which ultimately led to the project shutting down. What was thought as the future is now the past..Commando girls...   Commando girls...

"In the excerpt The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon Lüsted the builders had obstacles they had to overcome in building the dock for the dirigibles. The builders had to think about how the mast would work. It said in paragraph nine ""the architects could not simply drop a morning mast on top of the @ORGANIZATION1 flat roof. A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the buildings frame"". The buiders had to modify the building. ""As it said in paragraph ten ""Rather than building a utilitarian mast with out any ornamentation, the architects designed a shinny glass and chrome-nickle stainless steel tower that would be illinated frome inside, with a stepped-back design that imitated the over all shape of the building itself."" The obstacles the builders overcame let them use the mast efectly..She throws her hair into the February breeze   She hears it singing through the branches of the trees   A song of something you know so well   And she's still looking for a freeway      She hears the sound of distant planes across the sky   She catches fleeting glimpse of fading red tail lights   Into tomorrow she gently sleeps   And she's still dreaming of a freeway      Far away, there's a piece of luck somewhere   Shining like a star in the night   Dream on lady, till the early morning light   Takes your dream to be free away.Well, I heard the news   Ev'rybody rocking tonight..Who knows how long I've loved you   You know I love you still   Will I wait a lonely lifetime   If you want me to, I will      For if I ever saw you   I didn't catch your name   But it never really mattered   I will always feel the same      Love you forever and forever   Love you with all my heart   Love you whenever we're together   Love you when we're apart      And when at last I find you   Your song will fill the air   Sing it loud so I can hear you   And you know I will      Love you forever and forever   Love you with all my heart   Love you whenever we're together   Love you when we're apart      And when at last I find you   Your song will fill the air   Sing it loud so I can hear you   Make it easy to be near you   For the things you do endear you to me   All you know I will, I will.Laughter come on downtown window and see faces walking back   Tonight, everybody gonna remember, remember in time      Brings peace to watch a baby smile   And the years come   Bring us new ones   All that music waiting inside      No, everybody turns hero   Look at all the soul shaking life   Everybody turns hero tonight!.Makes you go left right up down   Makes you spinning round and round   Say ooh oh oh oh, say ooh oh oh oh!.Oh No I'm not!.Howl at the moon..If you're wondering why   When all I wanted from life was to be famous   I have tried for so long, it's all gone wrong   I'll tell you why   I'll tell you why   I'll tell you why   I'll tell you why   But you wouldn't believe me      You just haven't earned it yet, baby   You just haven't earned it, son   You just haven't earned it yet, baby   You must suffer and cry for a longer time   You just haven't earned it yet, Baby   And I'm telling you now....Let me introduce myself   I'm a woman that you've never seen   You might know me from somewhere else   As someone that I've never been."
"There were many obstacles workers face when building the Empire State Building: making the structure of the tallest in the world, making it serve a greater purpose than being just a building and most of all it had to be stable.Designing and building the tallest structure in the world was quite the @CAPS2 for architect Al Smith, his building had to be taller than the 1,046 foot tall Chrysler Building. The Chrysler building was originally only @NUM1 feet and the Empire State building was planned to be @NUM2 feet. But when the architect of the Chrysler Building revealed a spire that was to be placed on top, the Chrysler Building's height shot up to 1,046 feet, just 46 feet taller than the Empire State. The competition had begun.When Al Smith was constructing a piece to fit on top of the sky-scraping building, he wanted to be ""more than a spire or dome or pyramid put there to add a desired a few feet"" (paragraph @NUM3), he wanted something that would truly awe people. With the popularity of blimps, or dirigibles, on the rise, Smith decided he would create a docking station for them on top of his building. Although, a great deal of effort and frustration proved the task impossible. The main reason being that there was too much margin for error and that chance did not want to be taken with a crowded city of @ORGANIZATION3 below. The tip still being added though, put the Empire State Building at 1,250 feet, @NUM4 feet taller then the Chrysler Building.The @CAPS1 @CAPS2 that the building seems to face was the elements. The monstrous structure had to withstand very high winds. Most of the building was weather proof, the only problem being the top. It was designed to look almost like a rocketship, with four wings at it's base. Lined with steel, th structure still holds today. Most of the challenges faced by the crew building this magnificent structure seemed impossible, but they created the building they set out to build. And it is still the tallest in the world to this day..Who cares about little boys   That talk too much?.Ramblin' man makes no change in me   I'm going to ramble back to my used-to-be   Aww, you hear me talkin' to ya   I don't bite my tongue   You wanna be my man?.I don't know what day it is   Or if it's dark or fair   Somehow, that's just the way it is   And I don't really care      I go to this or that place   I seem alive and well   My head is just a hat place   My breast an empty shell   And I've a faded dream to sell      All alone, all at sea   Why does nobody care for me?.I will survive   Tonight I wander and I roam   Just lookin' for a way back home tonight      Spare me, a ride, a ride tonight   Spare me, a ride, a ride tonight      (On this island I am stuck   Could you correct my crooked luck tonight?).I know you have a lot of strength left.).You shove your way   Through the room from the street   And finally to me   You ask me what I'm drinking      My friend Johnny   Tugging on my sleeve   Asks if I wanna leave   But what I'm really thinking is      Why can't it be easy   Easy   Why don't you leave   Leave me   Leave me be   I can see you swaying   I can't hear what you're saying      I'm sitting here stuck   And plastered to my seat   I think up a reason to leave   When you finally stop speaking   I'll take a long slow   Walk down Washington Street   Half asleep on my feet   Half aware if I'm dreaming      I'll go home alone   A sinking stone   A switched off telephone   I'll go on and be free   A frozen breeze   A fallen down factory   But I still see you swaying   And I can't hear what you're saying      I just lost the plot   Got a little caught   In a little knot   I just hit a wall   Had a little fall   Felt the swinging wrecking ball      And why should that be   Why don't you tell me   Why don't you tell me   I'm sure you'll tell me   Why don't you tell me   I guess you'll tell me   Tell me.It's a good thing, got yourself a good thing, I'm gonna let you go   So you met somebody who set you back on your heels..Laying on it some,   Playing with it some   When I, I woke up with wood..No, I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more   Well, I wake up in the morning   Fold my hands and pray for rain."
"In Downtown New York, Al Smith and his builders faced many obstacles in building and docking his dirigible on top of the mooring mast which had come to a failure by the end. The reason he planned to dock in New York because that's where most passengers would be at the location, where Smith would see it would be a success. The dirigibles are made ""with enormous steel-framed balloon with envelopes of cotton fabric filled with hydrogen and helium"" (paragraph @NUM1), at the time that Smith wasn't thinking, ""hydrogen is highly flammable"" (paragraph @NUM2) as well as the cotton fabric would catch on fire also; it is a dangerous hazard if any incident would have been in a ""densely populated area."" Another obstacle they dealed with was the ""dirigibles could not more at the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas"" (paragraph @NUM3) since it was illegal to dock the dirigibles in low areas, it couldn't happen for Smith, and the size of the dirigible, it's too long to not able to crash into one of the other buildings. Not only that but ""the mooring mast could not get close enough to tie up because of forceful winds. Fearing that the wind would blow the dirigible onto sharp spires of the building in the area"" (paragraph @NUM3) and it would most likely to happen since there are many buildings closely to one another in New York. With all these problems that they had faced through; failed; the dirigibles wasn't the future transportation by Al Smith, all of his plan's failed by the end..Do you remember the time your heart was moved to tears?.Choose what you gonna do   Choose do what you gotta do   Choose what you gonna do   Choose do what you gotta do..If you want me to work on your case, let's get things straight, and now..How can you buy two blue Irish eyes?.Cause I'm stiched up like an angel chord, I'm fixed up   They try to run and hide somehere in there defense   And now want to hand me down again......Folks say my daddy wasn't much of a man   For disobeying the laws of the land   Folks say that my daddy wasn't fit to kill   Oh and I know it was true what the people said   Cause we'd all've been better of dead   Than to live a life of shame and strife   Cause of daddy's moonshine still   My mama was always sweet and kind   But she grew old before her time   Worryin' about the way we had to live   Yeah my daddy put the wrinkles in my mama's face   He drunk his share of all he made   And just one more reason I grew to hate   My daddy's moonshine still   Chorus:   Daddy's moonshine still was good for nothin'   But to break mama's heart   And to tear our home apart   Make our lives a livin' hell   Them old mason jars that daddy made us wash   And set them out to sun on our back porch   'Til he got ready to take 'em up on the hill   And when daddy got word of the revenue   He made us kids help hide his brew   Made us swear that we never knew   About daddy's moonshine still   Yeah and two of my brothers drove across the state line   Once a week with a load of moonshine   And the wounds that came from that won't ever heal   Cause on a moonshine run one rainy night   My two brothers lost their lives   And oh my god how I despise   My daddy's moonshine still   Repeat Chorus   Well it broke mama's heart but she understood   The day that I left home for good   But I had to find me another way to live   Well I sent mama money nearly every day   And how I made it, well I'd rather not say   But at least it took me far away   From daddy's moonshine still   My bootlegging daddy was known quite well   And he made our home a livin' hell   And I ain't forgot it and I know that I never will   My mama finally died she just gave up   And daddy finally died from drinkin' that stuff   And bad memories haunt the rest of us   From daddy's moonshine still   Repeat Chorus.My shattered dreams and broken heart   Are mending on the shelf   I saw you, holding hands   Standing close to someone else   Still I sit, all alone   Wishing all my feelings gone   I give my best to you   Nothing for me to do   But have one last cry      One last cry   Before I leave it all behind   I gotta put you out of my mind   This time   Believe that I   I guess I'm down to my last cry   [Cry...]      I was here, you were there   Guess we never could agree   While the sun shines on you   I need some love to rain on me   Still I sit, all alone   Wishing all my feelings gone   Gotta get over you [Gotta get over you]   Nothing for me to do [Yeah..]   But have one last cry      One last cry   Before I leave it all behind   I gotta put you out of my mind   This time...Do you know what I'm talking about?.Both: It's the age-old story how an evil boy, meets an evil girl."
"The mooring mast atop the empire state buildings problems should have been foreseeable before its construction. The workers building it were certainly against the odds during its construction. The top of the Empire State Building was in a constant weather crisis, ""Winds were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"". This meant that a dirigible that would attach to the mooring mast would be swaying in the wind. On land, dirigibles have lead dead weights that weighted the back so it didn't sway but that just wasn't practical hanging over crowded city streets. Also, the building could not support a dirigible without transferring its energy back down to the foundation. This meant that the entire building had to be reinforced to move the energy. It was also illegal for dirigibles to fly that low over urban areas, and since most @CAPS1 blimps were using hydrogen, a highly flammable substance, the safety of the project was questioned. After the Hindenburg, people seemed more reluctant to support such a project and even the owners of the Empire State Building realized how catastrophic an accident over a place like downtown New York could be. Overall, the theory of a mooring mast atop the Empire State Building would remain a theory due to predictable obstacles..Do you think it's only a game?.(Bridge)   Yes, I?ve seen some hard times   Some bad choices that I?ve made fell back on me   But now it?s time to move on, move on   Can?t let my past hold down my destiny   And even though I don?t always know   Why you allow the night to last so long   But when I see the sunlight   It was only to make me strong      Look at me?.I stand at your gate and the song that I sing is of moonlight   I stand and I wait for the touch of your hand in the June night   The roses are sighing a moonlight serenade      The stars are a glow and tonight how their light sets me dreaming   My love, do you know that your eyes are like stars brightly beaming?.So you're from Jacksonville, kickin' it like Buffalo Bill..I guess that you can see through me   So I'll be straight with you, I'll tell the truth   Friend in need is just really me.Download thoughts,   But your files are corrupted,   Don't just sit there and stare at me,   Don't just sit there and watch me bleed,   I'm losing you, and you, you're losing me..Ain't this my sun?.But God only knows this isn't reason or rhyme..Die by violence in this world   Is nothing strange for us   With all those chemicals, wars and destructions   We do not know what mother nature has in store for us   The race for economy   Makes people forget   The lives around this planet   As men become more egoistic   Pretty soon, there will be nothing in this world   For men to spare   Stupidity   Causing pain   And sickness   To our world   Suffer   Chorus   On the burial ground   Is what this planet is all about   It's where we are right now   We might not have any future to be found   On this burial ground   We have nowhere to hide   Death is laughing at our crimes   And now we are feeling the effects   That the forces of nature has brought   The droughts, earthquakes, volcanic eruptions   It's getting worse than ever before   We can see the revenge of this planet upon us   As we keep hurting the sea, the soil and the air   Sometimes some catastrophic accidents happen   Causing death rate and we wonder from where   People are dying in civilizations of different lands   Because of drought   Occurrences of flooding everywhere   Killing innocent people and leaving others in despair   Abomination because people fear that all these events   Happen without any warning killing unexpectedly   Men subjugate the forces of nature   But we don't know that it's destroying us slowly   The animals are becoming extinct   Seas and rivers polluted by toxic waste   Combustible smoke   Factories are creating acid rains   That is burning our skins, damaging plantations   And soon it will us to death   Air pollution is disintegrating our atmosphere   Allowing the ultra-violet rays to burn the earth   Ad to provoke us fear   Chorus   On the burial ground   Is what this planet is all about   It's where we are right now   We might not have any future to be found   On this burial ground   We have nowhere to hide   Death is laughing at our cries   Soon some of the lives on this planet   Won't exist anymore   Because we won't be able to recreate   Some of the beauty that we had before   Nobody seems to care   About the future of our children's civilizations   We better act now   So they won't have a life of torment and frustration   Stupidity   Causing pain   Punishment for violating   The ecologic balance   Chorus   On the burial ground   Is what this planet is all about   It's where we are right now   We might not have any future to be found   On this burial ground   We have nowhere to hide   Death is laughing at our face   Cursed by men this world has become   We are building our own tombs   By eliminating our source of life   When blindly we continue the destructions   There's no future   Day by day we are reaching the end of our lives"
"The engineers involved in the creation of the Empire State Building were forced to confront reality when an array of obstacles presented themselves during the time in which the were trying to dock dirigibles. The primary problem was the usefulness of this dock creation. Though this idea was innovative, it was not practical, as dirigibles were never destined to be a popular source of transport. The malfunction in the creation of the idea was its focus. This is because the goal in this work was not to create a successful dock, but to add footage to the building. If the focus had been different, the outcome may have been more rewarding. Technical problems also arose. Based on laws, safety, and practicality it could not function. ""Most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen,"" creating an extreme fire hazard in a highly populated place that would transform into a deathtrap. The anchor for the blimp would only secure it at one point allowing the blimp the spin around, dangerously in the wind. Lead weights, the only solution to this, would disrupt pedestrians. There was also an ""existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas,"" making the project completely unpractical. Both attempts at reaching the building failed, displaying the reality of the flaws. Winds and other complications were preventative. All in all, the builders were destined to be unsuccessful with the plethora of flaws in this project..Yeeeah...

" There was one major problem with the dirigibles docking on the Empire State Building. This major problem was that the mooring mast is so high up in the air and downtown New York where The Empire State Building is located is such a crowded area. If something goes wrong it will affect a huge area because New York is such an urban area. It is a good idea but Al Smith did not take all the precautions that he needed to. Because if something does go wrong a lot will go wrong because downtown New York is such a crowded area. Thats the main obstacle that the builders had to overcome with letting dirigibles dock on the mooring mast of the Empire State Building..I am a bird, watch me go drifting by..Everybody's had a few   Now they're talking about who knows who   I'm going back to the crescent city   Where everything's still the same   This town has said what it has to say   Now I'm after that back highway   And the longest bridge I've ever crossed over Pontchartrain      Tu les ton sans temps that's what we say   We used to dance the night away   Me and my sister me and my brother   We used to walk down by the river      Mama lives in mandeville   I can hardly wait until   I can hear my zydeco   And laissez le bon ton roulet   And take rides in open cars   My brother knows where the best bars are   Let's see how these blues'll do   In the town where the good times stay      Tu les ton sans temps that's what we say   We used to dance the night away   Me and my sister me and my brother   We used to walk down by the river      Tu les ton sans temps that's what we say   We used to dance the night away   Me and my sister me and my brother   We used to walk down by the river.The Cadillac stood by the house   And the yanks they were within   And the tinker boys they hissed advice   'Hot-wire her with a pin'   So we turned and shook as we had a look   In the room where the dead men lay   So big Jim Dwyer made his last trip   To the shores where his fathers laid      But fifteen minutes later   We had our first taste of whiskey   There was uncles giving lectures   On ancient Irish history   The men all started telling jokes   And the women they got frisky   At five o'clock in the evening   Every bastard there was piskey      Fare thee well, gone away   There's nothing left to say   Farewell to New York City boys   To Boston and PA   He took them out   With a well-aimed clout   And I often heard to say   I'm a free born man of the USA      He fought the champ in Pittsburgh   And he slashed him to the ground   He took on Tiny Tartanella   And it only went one round   He never had no time for reds   For drink or dice or whores   But he never threw a fight   When the fight was right   So they sent him to the war      Fare thee well   There's nothing left to say   With a slainte Joe and Erin go   My love's in Amerikay   The calling of the rosary   Spanish wine from far away   I'm a free born man of the USA      This morning on the harbour   When I said goodbye to you   I remember how I swore   That I'd come back to you one day   And as the sunset came to meet   The evening on the hill   I told you I'd always love you   I always did, I always will      Fare thee well, gone away, there's nothing left to say   Accept to say adieu   To your eyes as blue   As the water in the bay   To big Jim Dwyer   A man o'war who was often said to say   I'm a free born man of the USA      I'm a free born man of the USA   I'm a free born man of the USA   I'm a free born man of the USA.[Chorus]   Hey   Hey   Hey all the way   DJ let it play..Falling with no   Calling with no   Crawling to the end..I am here   Going insane (no)      Gotta go, gotta go yeah yeah   Get it yeah (oh)   Gotta go, gotta go, yeah yeah (oh)   Gotta go, Gotta go, Gotta go yeah yeah      Get it, Get it, it won't take   Get it, Get it, it's the way   Get it, Get it, this will take   My bedt can pay (???).Whoa-oh, Friday's child   Ya' cannot stop..You believe in me,   And I still have faith in....He's a busy lover (yeah yeah what'd I say?)"
"The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigible to dock there are lack of a suitable landing area. In the excerpt they said ""The one obstacle was their expanded use in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area"". Another obstacle was the climate like wind pressure. For example they said ""The stress of the dirigibles load and wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below"". The next obstacle is dirigibles from outside of the United States. The dirigibles German's use hydrogen which is flammable. They said ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States use hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable.

"Based on the article, ""the Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION2, there are many obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. @ORGANIZATION2 states in paragraph @NUM1, ""The mooring mast of the Empire State Building was destined to never fulfill its purpose, for reasons have been aparent before it was ever constructed."" One reason was safety. The dirigibles that were made outside of @LOCATION1 contained hydrogen instead of helium, thats wrong because hydrogen is highly flammable. Another reason was because of the winds. They constantly change, they are violent air currents, and they moved the dirigible. The other reason and most important reason is because dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building because its illegal. There is a law against airships fly too low over urban areas and for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach it was illegal. There were many obstacles the builders went through..Three times six and four times seven,   Twenty-eight and eleven,   She's a young thing   And cannot leave her mother..I was alone and fancy free   Enjoying all my liberty      I met you, baby   Then things changed   I started acting   Oh, so strange      Do I like it, do I like it   Yes, I do      Well, every day I had a ball   I didn't have a care at all   And everything was just okay   Until you made me change my way      Do I like it, do I like it   Yes, I do      Like a schoolboy   Loves his cherry pie   You really move me   My, oh, my      You caught me, baby   I'm really hooked   No doubt about it   My goose is cooked      It won't be long before I hear   Her whisper softly in my ear   I love you, baby, yes, I do   And from now on   It's me and you      Do I like it, do I like it   Yes, I do      Like a schoolboy   Loves his cherry pie   You really move me   My, oh, my      You caught me, baby   I'm really hooked   No doubt about it   My goose is cooked      It won't be long before I hear   Her whisper softly in my ear   I love you, baby, yes, I do   And from now on   It's me and you      Do I like it, do I like it   Yes, I do.I was out of my mind..My academy..Love is a stranger, love is a box,   Love is the key that fits a million locks,   Love is a mystery when love is the devil you call..Summer   Where do we begin?.Have you seen my shows?.Earth is the loneliest planet of all   Earth is the loneliest planet of all      Day after day you say one day   One day   Day after day you say one day   One day      But you're in the wrong place and you've got the wrong face   And humans are not really very humane   And Earth is the loneliest planet of all      Earth is the loneliest planet of all   Live with a loneness that no one else knows      Time after time you say next time   Next time   Time after time you say next time   Next time      But you fail as a woman and you lose as a man   We do what we can   And Earth is the cruelest place that you will never understand      But you're in the wrong skin   And the skin that you're in says   Oh, let it begin   And Earth is the loneliest planet of all      Earth is the loneliest planet of all   Earth is the loneliest planet of all      Day after day you say one day   One day   Day after day you say one day   One day      But there's always a reason why you refuse   They always blame you, you, you   And there is nothing anyone can do.Don't know what happened."
"The builders faced a lot of obstacles when building the empire state Building. They had to build it higher than any other building, but make sure its stable at the same time. They also had to make the top of the building perfectly or else the dirigibles would not be able to land.

"The Empire State Building was meant to be great The tallest building in the world. Although they did achieve there goal of height, the true purpose of the building was never used.The building was supposed to serve as a holding dock for these new air Ships called dirigibles. However this was not the case. There were reasons that were apparent before it was ever builtOne of the greatest obstacles was nature itself The winds at the top of the building were too strong for the dirigible to be safetly secure. The back of the ship would swivel around the mooring mast, and trying to weigh it down with bricks was impractical. Another problem that was faced was the law that would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area. But two ships did try to land. The U.S. Navy dirigible Los Angeles failed in landing because it was too dangerous. In the end, the Empire State Building never served as a station for dirigibles..Louie, Louie, me gotta go..1998 Shepherd Boy Musicascap (adm.

"In the excerpt, ""The Mooring Mast,"" by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle was in paragraph 6, the excerpt says, ""one obstacle to their expanded use in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area."" This means that the architects needed to build enough area to land the dirigibles, precisely and carefully. Another obstacle was in paragraph @NUM1, which said, ""the greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" This is explaining that the outcome of nature can be predicted, but it cannot be controlled. The amount of ""violent air currents"" can disturb the landing of dirigibles and it is ""neither practical nor safe"" for the dirigibles to dangle high above the pedestrians that are on the street. Unfortunately, Al Smith's plan to able the dirigibles to moor at the Empire State Building was unsuccessful. There was a law stated in paragraph @NUM2, that made ""it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approached the area"". Instead of using the mooring mast, the dirigibles gave way to airplanes..Well, my mama was a-scared of that grizzly bear,   My mama was a-scared on that grizzly bear..Some people tell me   The blues

"In the excerpt, the builders and architects building the Empire State Building had numerous problems trying to build the mast on the top of the building. One reason was that they built it before even considering the problems it may cause. The biggest problem was safety: ""the hydrogen used in the dirigibles was highly flammable."" Another problem was wind: ""they would never be able to use the mooring mast because of the violent winds shifting at that height."" If the dirigible was ever tied to the building, ""it's back end would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" The derigibles moored in fields could be held down with lead weights but using those @NUM1 feet above downtown New York would not be safe at all. The final problem was a law against airships flying that low over cities and pedestrians.

"The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced were many. The architects could not simply drop the mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building that was only held by a single cable tether. This would add stress to the buildings frame. To be able to handle the dirigible's load the steel frame of the Empire State building would have to be modified and Strengthened, which was over sixty thosand dollars 'worth. Another obstacle was nature. The winds on top of the building were always shifting which could lead to the back of the ship swiveling around and around the mooring mast..Don't you know I love the way you hold me   I feel so safe in your arms   It means so much the way you hold my hand   All a part of your charm..It's such a selfish way to lose   The way you lose these wasted blues   These wasted blues..Order!.I'm just a love machine   A huggin' kissin' fiend..It's dr surd..Everytime I hear that song,   I think of someone who is gone,   And the hurtin' starts comin' on real strong,   Everytime I hear that song..Layla, I'm begging, darling please..Opening me within a gesture..We'd go on for ever, 'til the end of time."
"The obstacles that the builders of The Empire State builduing faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were they had to allow the dirigibles to anchor there for several hours for refueling or service, and to let passengers on or off. The dirigibles were docked by means of electric Winch, Which hauled in a line from the front of the Ship and then tied it to a mast. The body of the dirigibles Could Swing in the breeze, and yet passengers Could Safely get on and off the dirigible by walking down a gangplank to an open observation platform. They had to go through all these obstacles in order to build The Empire State builduing..It's too late, she's gone   It's too late, my baby's gone   Wish I had told her she was my only one   But it's too late, she's gone      It's a weak man that cries   So I guess I'd better dry my eyes   Guess I will miss her more than anyone   But it's too late she's gone      She's gone yeah she's gone   She's gone my baby's gone   She's gone yeah she's gone   Where can my baby be?.If I ever should prove false to thee   The day will turn to night..Never thought that it would be this way without you   It's taking all I have just to live from day to day   My heart aches for you I can't believe we're through,   Oh baby, I miss you      [Chorus:]   I'm lost, I'm lost without you baby   The days aren't the same the nights are cold and gray   I need you in my life   If not now then someday      As I think about the time we've shared together   The way I feel for you I know I'll never feel again   Memories of loving you still linger in my head   Oh baby, I miss you      [Chorus]      There's a feeling deep inside of me   That just won't let you go   And the more I try to fight it   The more it seems to show...can't let you go      [Chorus]      I'm lost without you baby   The days aren't the same the nights are cold and gray   I need you right now   Uh, If not now, maybe someday.Mama?.Today   Today      I saw a man   Today   I saw a man   Using an empty whiskey flask   As a walkie talkie      Today   Today      I saw a man   Today   I saw a man   With a flaming eight ball   Tattooed on his arm      Today   Today   Today      I saw a man   Today   I saw a man   Using an empty whiskey flask   As a walkie talkie      Today   I met a man   Who threw his arms around me      And you give in...

"The architects didn't realize how many potential problems the mooring mast would bring until it had failed. The greatest reason why the dirigibles couldn't land was purely safety complications. Many dirigibles at the time used hydrogen rather than helium, which is highly flammable. Another main reason was nature itself. The winds on top of the building were very violent and could easily push a dirigible in the wrong direction. Before these problems, there was an already existing law against the flying of airships too low over urban areas. Dirigibles could not dock at the Empire State building because it was unsafe and illegal..I wanna go      I wanna go and when I get there   Girl I get there when I'm there I wanna go      I wanna go   I wanna go   I wanna go c c c c c c r a z y      Where I wanna go ain't geographical   You cant Google map map-quest it when I go loco   If you need to know the designational I'm going crazy   I ain't by myself I'm coming with a whole bunch of ladies      Celebrating life to the max these girls are suicidal   In the club sippin' bottle after bottle after bottle   Celebration never stoppin'   Situation club hoppin'      Simulation panty droppin'   Penetration coochie poppin'   Then am out!.Stop   Listen to the sound   Of moving feet ..(2x)      You're not a bad man (bad man),   You excel in cold frustration..There's a star in the palm of my hands   And I think it's yours   You don't want me   Then I'll understand   You deserve much more   When I brought it   Down from the sky, you almost forgot it   It was new back when you gave a dam   What ya need I'll go and get it..Don't turn your back now, I'm talking to you      Should I pursue a path so twisted ?.Down to earth by christina aguilera      Down to earth x10      I've been feelin down to earth yea babyx2      I've found my love and now my head is spinning around   Trying to find the women inside me      O yea baby   down to earth, down to earth babyx10      Music      I've tried my best to come this far   but weho spoils it.....Broken, beaten down can't even get around   Without an old-man cane I fall and hit the ground   Shivering in the cold, I'm bitter and alone      Excuse the bitchin' - I shouldn't complain   I should have no feeling, 'cause feeling is pain   As everything I need is denied me   And everything I want is taken away from me   But who do I got to blame?.Have I told you lately that I love you   Could I tell you once again somehow   Have I told, with all my heart and soul how I adore you   Well darlin' I'm tellin' you now..And his fame spread out from shore to shore, he'd all that he could do and more,   He had to buy a plane to get around."

"When the empire state building was constructed it ran into many problems attempting to dock dirigibles there. One problem they ran into is that most overseas blimps were still filled with hydrogen, which is a very flammable gas. The constructors did not want to re-create the Hindenburg accident over a densely populated area such as New York City. The greatest obstacle to the mooring mast was nature itself. The wind currents atop the building were violent and always shifting. Docking a Dirigible there in those conditions would cause it to swivel around the building and become unsafe for passengers. That is why the mooring mast never fulfilled it's purpose..My journey is over now and I realized   These eternal tears forever I'll cry..I hear she's kickin' ass across the board   And rock two hundred thousand higher scorer   Just in time to save the world of being taken over   She's a warrior   I couldn't play again because the game   It never end it never even landed on the can   And never let me in to spend my quarter   There's no love for me no more      Say it isn't so   How she easily come, how she easy go   Please don't tell her that I miss her   Because I don't      She was the girl with the broadest shoulders   But she would die before I crawled over them   She is taller than I am   She knew I wouldn't mind the view there   Or the altitude with a mouth full of air   She let me down and doubt came out until the now became later      Say that it isn't so   How she easily come, how she easy go   Please don't tell her that I've been meaning to miss her   Because I don't   Not for her   It's not that I'm mad to forgive   Forget what I said      That I'm crazy like the rest of us   And I'm crazier when I'm next to her, ha      So why after the all of everything that came   And went I care enough to still be singing of the bitter end and broken eras   I told you I don't but   I am only trying to be the best with my intent to cure   The rest is sure to lay me ease the plural hurts of the words of reverse psychology   That's easier said   Easier than done   Please don't dare tell her what I've become   Please don't mention all the attention I have drawn   Please don't bother cause she'll feel guilty when I'm gone      Because I'm crazy like the rest of us   And I'm crazier when I'm next to her   And it's amazing how she's self-assured   And I know she'd hate me if she knew my words   Do I hurt anymore   Do I hurt, well   I don't   I don't   I don't.Or am I just dreaming?.Such a silly, silly, silly, silly fool am I   Oh, I, just a silly, silly, silly, silly fool am I      Hey, I should have never fallen   Back in love with you   Knowin' how you get a pleasure   Breaking my poor heart in two   You made it sound so convincin'   When you said   ""I'm your woman, you're my man""   Now I really need you   And I sit here a loser again      I guess I'm just a silly, silly, silly, silly fool am I, oh I   I'm such a silly, silly, silly, silly, fool am I, mmm      I should have never trusted   In my heart to lead the way   Now my mind is all busted   That's a fool's price to pay      You made it sound so convincin'   When you said you'd never, never go away   I should have never listened   To anything you had to say      I'm such a silly, silly, silly, silly, silly, silly fool am I, yes I am   I'm such a silly, silly, silly, silly fool am I, oh   Such a silly, silly, dilly, silly, dilly fool am I, oh yeah   I'm such a silly, silly, silly, silly, silly fool am I, oh yes I am   I'm such a silly, silly, dilly, silly, dilly, silly fool am I, oh yeah   I'm such a silly, dilly, silly, dilly, silly fool am I, oh   Silly, dilly.Until now, I knew this of myself   That if you had thrown yourself down   Into the lion's den   My brother I'd follow you in   Perhaps I lack some foresight (should have known)   Brother you were so right   Sure as the setting sun   Can't trust just anyone      That's what you want, but it's not what you're asking for   I said that's what you're asking, but you're gonna get more than you bargained for   I said that's what you had, but you don't have it any more   You had it coming      I never imagined you dead (I never)   But tell me, are you even aware   That all that we did, you undo   Iscariot, you fool      That's what you want, but it's not what you're asking for   I said that's what you're asking, but you're gonna get more than you bargained for   I said that's what you had, but you don't have it any more   You had it coming      Oh you know you had it coming my friend, my friend   You know you had it coming my brother, oh my brother   Had it coming my friend, my friend   You know you had it coming my brother, oh my brother   Had it coming my friend, my friend   You know you had it coming my brother, oh my brother   Had it coming my friend, my friend   You had it coming..Cause you see I'm a dinosaur   I should have died out a long time before   Have Pitty on a dinosaur   Hand me my hat excuse me maam   But where's the door!.It's nice to spend the time with you   I know you've got a lot to go for   I like the things you say and do   And yet what do I have to show for   Nice to pass away   Then another break of day   Lovin',   Lovin', lovin' or leavin'   I'm for lovin', lovin' or leavin'   Lovin', lovin' or leavin'   I said lovin', lovin' or leavin' yeah...

"By reading the passage ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lüsted it is easy to see the many complications with landing a dirigible on top of a 1,250 ft. building. For one there is the natural effect of wind. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" @CAPS1 winds would make it difficult to land any floating aircraft anywhere if the back wasn't able to be weighted down. Another obstacle the builders faced was that the frame had to be strong enough to hold a @NUM1 ft. long dirigible. ""The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation."" The worker's then had to spend over @MONEY1 to remodel the framework of the Empire State Building. Another issue is that anchoring the blimps would be illegal. According to ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" All these safety troubles and violations would all together make the ""mooring"" an impossible feat..Just yesterday morning they let me know you were gone   Suzanne the plans they made put an end to you   I walked out this morning and I wrote down this song   But I just can't remember who to send it to   I've seen fire and I've seen rain   I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end   I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend now   But I always thought that I'd see you again   Won't you look down upon me jesus   You gotta help me make a stand   You just got to see me through another day   My body's achin' and my time is at hand   I won't make it any other way   I've seen fire and I've seen rain   I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end   I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend now   But I always thought that I'd see you again   I've been walkin' my mind to an easy time   My back turned towards the sun   Lord knows when the cold wind blows it'll turn your head around   But there's hours of time on the telephone line   To talk about things to come   Sweet dreams and flying machines in pieces on the ground   I've seen fire and I've seen rain   I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end   I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend now now now   But I always thought that I'd see you again.Like a river, yeah, like a river   Running through you, running through your heart and soul..we talkin' de hypocritical jeezis-jerknuh parodise dey call las vagrus nevadruh!.Baby I, I wanna know   What you think when you're alone   Is it me?.Can you tie them in a knot?.Mooning over you,      I'll stand behind (you'll stand behind) you mooning, forever more..This ain't serious   This will make you delirious   If we didn't buss   Every artist woulda fraid of us      First 'pon di list, di one name Beres   Teck di watch off a him wrist   Outta Wyndham Terrace   Him try 'putting up a resistance'   But di sixpence ask him   If him want meet Dennis   Tek Bling Dawg Lexxus   Tell him walk dung him shoe   Him seh Kartel a you   'If a nuh me den a who'   Juck Wayne Marshall   Pon gunpoint interview   Mi seh 'You want live', him seh 'Choo'   So mi drive weh di Mitsubishi   Drive go over Hellshire   Lef it roun' a Schreechy   Order two snapper, weh steamy   Guess who mi si tan up a pre-me?.Almighty power, building higher, you'll never be the same!.He used to cut my grass ."
"The architects and builders faced large problems in the construction of the docking platform, even though they had not notice them at first. The builders did not notice any large problem untill after the dirigible Hindenburg crashed in Lakehurst. The building's owners became greatly concerned for the safety of the people inside and below the building if a blimp fell into the same situation as the Hindenburg..How many lonely, sleepless nights?.Yippee!.Is it you girl I'm thinking of?.What's with the hostility?.Goddamn you say you'll get up with me..Hold on tightly to your innocence   And don't you let go   Until you know it's gonna be your way      Through the tangle and the bramble   There's a thread that runs through   And it's true   There's no need to be afraid      Smiling ear to ear   It's something in the atmosphere   Every star above reflecting in your sea of love   Is it just a dream   Or are things as they really seem   Somebody help me make the call      You could be the light   That shines so bright   You show the way to go   And if it's so   Don't be too surprised      Just give yourself a chance   And take a glance   Around to see the glow   Burning in my eyes      Smiling ear to ear   It's something in the atmosphere   Every star above reflecting in your sea of love   This is not a dream   It's just the way it's always been   You've got to rise above it all      Somewhere down the road that we follow   We'll be one with everything   I know as soon as tomorrow   We could be arriving      Somewhere down the road that we follow   We'll be one with everything   I know as soon as tomorrow   We could be arriving   And in my dreams I'm there by your side   Learning to fly again      The world we see (World we see and hear)   Is a mystery (Mystery but we)   But we hold the key (Hold the key to the door)   If we have the faith to live (Have the faith anymore)   And believe      Somewhere down the road that we follow   We'll be one with everything   I know as soon as tomorrow   We could be arriving   And in my dreams I'm there by your side   Learning to fly again.Oh, oh, oh, oh   Oh, oh, oh, oh   Oh, oh, oh, oh   Oh, oh, oh, oh      Something make my chest stir   Something make my head blur   (Oh, oh)   I'm not ready for a handshake with death, no   (Oh, oh)   I'm just such a happy mess, whoa      The drums are four on the floor   She's back to the bedroom for one more   I'm the invisible man   Who can't stop staring at the mirror, at the mirror      I want to make you as lonely as me   So you can get, get addicted to this   You can get, get addicted to this now      Oh, oh, oh, oh   Oh, oh, oh, oh   Oh, oh, oh, oh   Oh, oh, oh, oh      It's three things too late to talk to anyone but myself   (Oh, oh)   It's a three and two pitch to walk to anywhere else, no      The drums are four on the floor   She's back to the bedroom for one more   I'm the invisible man   Who can't stop staring at the mirror, at the mirror      I want to make you as lonely as me   So you can get, get addicted to this   You can get, get addicted to this now      Oh, oh, oh, oh   Oh, oh, oh, oh   Oh, oh, oh, oh   Oh, oh, oh, oh      I'm the invisible man   Who can't stop staring at the mirror, at the mirror      I want to make you as lonely as me   So you can get, get addicted to this   You can get, get addicted to this now      I'm the invisible man   (I'm the invisible man)   I'm the invisible man   (I'm the invisible man)   I want to make you as lonely as me   'Cause I'm the invisible man   I'm the invisible man.Jingle bells, jingle bells,   Jingle all the way!.Get on the floor, it's only natural love   Hey you!"
"The builders of the Empire State building faced not so many but difficult obstacles. one of the obstacles were the crowded @CAPS1 they had for the dirigible. crowded @CAPS1 can cause the dirigible to hit or bump into another building if not pop the thing. The wind could also make the dirigible sway and hit another building. Another obstacle was the stress the building was having because the dirigible was tied to it. If the wind blew hard, the dirigible would put alot of tension on the building and something could go wrong..She doesn't exist any more,   She doesn't exist any more..He brings you out in style..Toot your organ and   Well be away.).""Doctor Long John..I paint a smile on you   'Cause you want me to   Then I unmask you   Laughing in your face      If you had half a mind   I wouldn't even try   But you're so naive   Just can't let you be      Make me glorious   And victorious   I'm superior      Time to pay the price   Throw off my disguise   Poison in your veins   So easily deceived   The lie that you believe   Poison in your veins      You follow my advice   And feed my appetite   What you leave behind   I will claim as mine      In the end you'll see   What you're meant to be   Something obsolete   Mission is complete      Call me a disgrace   To the human race   I don't give a damn      It's time to pay the price   Throw off my disguise   Poison in your veins   So easily deceived   The lie that you believe   Poison in your veins.(You better believe it darlin'..Sometimes he's lightly sleeping in the quiet of his room,   But then his eyes will rise and stare through mine,   He'll speak my words and slice my mind inside..(little Liza)   Yeah, this little girl turn me upside down (little Liza)   Well, all of the little girls that I had (little Liza)   You know this little girl drives me to despair (little Liza)      [Chorus]      Yeah, I got a girl who loves me true (little Liza)   Now she ain't more than five foot two, yeah (little Liza)   You know this little girl is so good for me, yeah (little Liza)   You know this little girl's nearly half of me (little Liza)      [Chorus]      Oh yeah, I love her   Little Liza Jane   Well, I'm coming back to me love   Cause she's driving insane   When will I meet her.Non dire cos?"
" Some obstacles the builders faced were too much stress to the buildings frame. It would have to transmit all the weight and pressure all the way to the building's foundation. Also there would only be one cable holding it in place. The cable was called a tether. Another obstacle would be an existing law saying that you cant moor your ship there because you are flying to low. In December 1930 the @ORGANIZATION1 dirigible tried parking there but they were affraid of the wind knocking it into another building. Therefor they went threw a few hard obstacles but in the end they fixed it and made it happen..I need some time just to catch my breath,   Tell me honey do I past your test..Kinda like a cloud I was up way up in the sky..Don't you know me?.Plans made in the nursery   Can change the course of history   Remember that      Mummy's annoyed, says go and play   Don't show your face   Stay away all day   Shouldn't have done that      A small boy and his infantry   Marching around so naturally   Shouldn't have done that      Grows up and goes to school   Such a nice boy   Obeys all the rules   Mummy's proud of that      Leaves school to follow his ambition   Knows what he wants   To be a politician   Shouldn't have done that!.Say is this an express train?.We leave home expecting to find a blue bird,   Hoping ev'ry cloud will be silver lined..I never thought I'd change my   Opinion again   But you moved me in a way that I've   Never known   You moved me in a way that I've   Never known      But straight away you just moved   Into position again   You abused me in a way that I've   Never known   You abused me in a way that I've   Never known      So break me shake me hate me   Take me over   When the madness stops then you   Will be alone   Just break me shake me hate me   Take me over   When the madness stops then you   Will be alone      So you're the kind that deals with the   Games in the mind   Well you confuse me in a way that   I've never known   You confuse me in a way that I've   Never known      So break me shake me hate me   Take me over   When the madness stops then you   Will be alone   So won't you break me shake me hate me   Take me over   When the madness stops then you   Will be alone      She says, "" I can help you, but what   Do you say?"".Oh leavin' home ain't easy   I thought how could I think of leavin'   Leavin' on your own   Still tryin' to persuade me that   Leavin' home ain't necessarily the only way   Leavin' home ain't easy   But may be the only way.."
"Derigibles, modernly called blimps were widely regarded in the @DATE1's as the latest and greatest form of transportation there was. These derigibles needed quick means of refueling and unloading passenger both eficiently and with safety. At the very time these derigibles became popular modern day skyscrapers such as the Empire State Building and the Chrysler Building were dominating the skyline in New York City. Al Smith, a former governor of New York who was heading efforts to construct the Empire State Building came up with the idea of building a mooring mast on the top of his building which would help dirigibles dock, refuel and unload cargo quickly and efficiently. Although, at the time this idea was thought of as both ""practical"" and ""workable"" it was never put to use because of safety concerns found later by Architects. These safety concerns included fear of the ""constantly shifting"" winds ""due to violent air currents"" as well as air space restricting laws that prohibited ""airships from flying too low over urban areas."" Although this idea seemed revolutionary at the time, many obstacles stood in its path to glory..Some say love, it is a river, that drowns the tender reed   Some say love, it is a razor, that leaves your soul to bleed   Some say love, it is a hunger, an endless aching need   I say love, it is a flower, and you, it's only seed      It's the heart afraid of breaking, that never learns to dance   It's the dream afraid of waking, that never takes the chance   It's the one who won't be taken, who can not seem to give   And the soul afraid of dying, that never learns to live      When the night has been too lonely and the road has been too long   And you think that love is only for the lucky and the strong   Just remember in the winter, far beneath the bitter snow   Lies the seed, that with the sun's love in the spring becomes the rose..And then pretend not to notice   (Tu ru tu)   All the years we've been here   We're the bums you step over   (Tu ru tu)   As you leave the Theatre   (Yeah)   (Yeah)      In the end, you pretend   (Tu ru tu)   'Cause it's so much easier   We're the bums you step over   (Tu ru tu)   As you leave the Theatre (Yeah)   (Yeah)   (Yeah)   (Tu ru tu)      We're the bums you step over   (Tu ru tu )   As you leave the Theatre   (Yeah)   (Yeah)      (Ha ha ha ha ...).My friend   I gotta see that main man      I killed all my nerves   My nerves?.That's why I know I'd rather believe in You..How long can I hold on till you say good-bye baby   You're gone and it's so wrong and now my heart cries for you girl..Time for me to put my boots out in the streets..I'm free and I'm ready, so we can go steady   Hows about sharing all of your company   No more lookin', I know I said lookin'   Hows about keepin' steady company..Gals are jealous, there's no doubt..I don't know what it's like to be alive,   To say goodbye,   To cry a thousand tears   Because my ears won't listen      Human I'm trying not to lose my faith in you,   I've sussed out all that I've seen through,   I've sailed an ocean      I am so scared of what I'll look like in the end   For I am not prepared,   I hope I will get the chance to be someone   To be human,   Look what we've done,   Look what we've done      I used to hear it all so loud,   The sound of my heart breaking."
" The obstacles that the architects of the Empire State Building faced was harsh. They had to figure out how they were going to get the dirigibles to land on the mooring mast. A another problem was that the government was getting unpaticent. What made thing worse was Al smith was being sneaky and unturful. He lied about how high the actulty hieght is. He lied about how he will fix the problems the was with the mooring mast. They were also afraid that a dirigible will blowup on the mooring mast like the @CAPS1.

"There were three main obstacles the builders of the Empire State building faced when they attempted to allow dirigibles to dock at the mooring mast. The first obstacle was ""nature itself"", meaning that the air currents at the top of the Empire State building were so powerful that the wind was constantly changing directions. This meant that if a dirigible could somehow fly through the winds and could be tied to the mast it would ""swivel around and around"" and would end up ""dangling over pedestrians"" which ""was neither practical nor safe."" @CAPS1, A dirigible is not leagally allowed to dock at the mooring mast because it would be ""flying too low over urban areas"" Which there is an ""existing law"" against. This is a problem for the builders because no matter how hard they attempted to allow dirigibles to dock, they would not be leagally allowed to dock dirigibles at the Mooring Mast. Lastly, many dirigibles used hydrogen gas as a feul. Hydrogen gas is ""highly flammable"" and a dirigible using hydrogen gas is therefore also highly flammable and could potentially pose a disaster to the ""densely populated area such as downtown New York."" Because of potential fires, city laws, and air currents, the builders of the Empire State Building were faced with obstacles when they tried to allow dirigibles to dock at the mooring mast.I'll always stay (whoa yeah)   Oh, I'm feelin'... glad all over (yes I'm)   Glad all over (ma, mama)   Glad all over, so glad you mine   I'll over last love, till the end of time   Because it's love, it's all yours to claim   I'm feelin'... glad all over (yes I'm)   Glad all over (ma, mama)   Glad all over, so glad you're mine   All the girls, they try to take me away   But you know, it's by your side I'll always stay....How does it feel?.Wag mo na sanang,      Ano pa kaya ang dapat gawin ng isang katulad ko   Upang paniwalaan at intindihin mo   Ang mga nais sabihin ng puso ko   Bigyan mo ako ng pagkakataon   Paliwanagan ang iyong isip      Kahit'sandali lang, patutunayan ko lang   Na mahal kita hanggang ngayon      Oh, ang babae, nakakatuwa   Maliit na bagay lamang pinalalaki pa   Ba't ayaw mong limutin ang nakaraan   'Di mo na ako pinapansin, 'di na rin minamasdan      Wag mo na sanang isipin ang mga nangyari sa atin noon   Kahit ano pang sabihin mo maibabalik pa natin ang kahapon      Sana naman hanggang dito na lang   Ang paghihirap kong ito   Dapat pa bang daanin, sa galit o tampuhan   Dadami pang problemang 'di kailangan   Kailan pa ba o 'di na ba   Tayo magkakasunduan      Kahit'sandali lang patutunayan ko lang   Na minamahal mo pa ako      Oh, ang babae, nakakaaliw   Kahit sobra siyang pakipot, siya'y nakakabaliw   Ba't ayaw mong limutin ang nakaraan   'Di mo na ako pinapansin, 'di na rin minamasdan      Wag mo na sanang isipin ang mga nangyari sa atin noon   Kahit ano pang sabihin mo maibabalik pa natin ang kahapon      Wag mo na sanang (wag mo na sanang), wag mo na sanang isipin (wag mo na   Sanang isipin)   Wag mo na sanang (wag mo na sanang), wag mo na sanang isipin (wag mo na   Sanang isipin)      'Di mo na ako pinapansin, 'di narin minamasdan      Wag mo na sanang (wag mo na sanang), wag mo na sanang isipin (wag mo na   Sanang isipin)   Wag mo na sanang (wag mo na sanang), wag mo na sanang isipin (wag mo na   Sanang isipin)      Kahit ano pang sabihin mo maibabalik pa natin ang kahapon      Wag mo na sanang (wag mo na sanang), wag mo na sanang isipin (wag mo na   Sanang isipin)   Wag mo na sanang (wag mo na sanang), wag mo na sanang isipin (wag mo na   Sanang isipin)   Wag mo na sanang isipin.I no longer deny these thoughts filling my head   I'm left to decide for this path I've been led   If there's more to life than just death      [Chorus]      It's alright, I'm only bleeding.Midnight flyer   Take me to L.A..We're centuries apart   And the lights are shining down on you..Got to get a brand new experience..In the midst of life we are in debt etc!.And the night was filled with laughter   Echoing through painted smiles   And I knew each morning after   I never loved, was never touched   Gave not at all, got back as much   In the co-o-omfort of   A modern day version of lo-o-ove      Truly, how I've cursed the sweet taste   Of lips that ask so-o much of me   Still I wonder with every embrace   Could I give, and not break   Should I care, and forsake   All the co-o-omfort of   A modern day version of lo-o-ove      Close my eyes and keep on runnin'   Realise it isn't gonna work anymor-ore   For me, yeah-eah   I'm afraid, well maybe that's somethin'   Never cared enough to be afraid of anything   Before, not before ..."

"In, The Mooring Mast, by @ORGANIZATION2, there were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One problem was that the architects could not drop the mooring mast on top of the Empire State building's flat roof. A thousand-foot dirigible would add stress to the building's frame. This means the still frame would have to be modified and strengthened. Another setback was that most blimps from outside the United States used hydrogen and hydrogen is highly flammable.Nature itself was the greatest obstacle. The winds on top on the building were always shifting due to the violent air current. If the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around. Lead weights were an option, but using these, where they would be dangling above pedestrians on the street, was not safe. The other practical reason why blimps could not more at the Empire State building was a law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building..Will you grease your way into Heaven?.Or am I over thinking thoughts of human after all      Only human   Made of flesh, made of sand, made of you and me   The planet's talking about a revolution   The natural laws ain't got no constitution   They've got a right to live their own life   But we keep paving over paradise      [Chorus]   Cause we're only human   Yes we are, only human   If it's our only excuse do you think we'll keep on being only human   Yes we are, yes we are   Only human, only human, only human   So far...

"There was many different obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there.

"Based on the excerpt, there were a few obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One reason was that ""most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" The owners of the Empire State building realized that if a dirigible was destroyed by fire over a density populated area like New York, there could have been a huge acadent One of the greatest obstacles however was nature itself. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" When the dirigibles would try to dock, they sometimes could not even get close to the building because of the strong winds By having the dirigibles hanging over pedestrians on the streets of New York, it was considered unpractical and unsafe. Due to mother nature and safety reasons, the builders of the Empire State building faced a few problems in allowing dirigibles to dock there.I can recall Utopian thinking   Bold mission statements and tightening of belts   Demolition of familiar landmarks   Promises made and deals that were dealt      This used to be the future   Where it was at back then   Let's turn the whole bloody lot down   And start all over again      But that future was exciting   Science fiction made fact   Now all we have to look forward to   Is a sort of suicide pact      Was it the dear old future   That created the problems we face?.Triple-A' came, but my card was expired!.Bells will be ringing, the glad - glad news   For what a Christmas to have the blues   My baby's gone and I have no friends   To wish me greetings once again   Oh, crowds will be singing Silent Night   Christmas carols by candlelight      Please come home for Christmas   Please come home for Christmas   If not for Christmas, by New Year's night      Friends and relations, send salutations   As sure as the stars shine above   Yes it's Christmas, Christmas my dear   It's the time of the year -- time of the year   To be with the one you -- the one you really love      Oh won't you tell me, we'll never grow old      Christmas and New Years will find you home   They'll be no more sorrow, no more grief and pain   Because I'll be happy that it's Christmas once again      Please come home for Christmas baby   They'll be no more sorrow, no more grief and pain   Because I'll be happy, Lord I'll be so happy   Happy once again.I have seen your soul turn black   And then retreat   To that dark place where no one else may follow   I waited here for your returning   To roll your cigarette   And wash your bloodied feet      You have heard the silent running   Of my dreams   Broke me from the grip of grief and fever   With the sound of your voice speaking my name   And a kiss   That I will feel forever      In the hour of gold, the hour of lead   WG did forge our wedding bed   On a hard and holy road   We lay down our head   In tha hour of gold, the hour oi lead      I have watched you riding on   The wall of death   And when il finally breaks you and you fall   I will tear this dress of muslin that you gave me   To bind the fatal wound   And catch your last sweet breath      In the hour of gold, the hour of lead   We did forge our wedding bed   On a hard and holy road   We lay down our head   In the hour of gold, the hour of lead      But the world will be my witness when   They excavate my heart   And find the image of your face   Imprinted there like some Shroud of Turin   That neither time Nor tundra could erase      In the hour of gold, the hour of lead   We did forge our wedding bed   On a hard and holy road   We lay down our head   In the hour of gold, the hour of lead.Managed to push myself away,   And you, as well..Narrator:   Potiphar had very few cares..Mercy!.Awake the voice!.They're in my heart today."
"The obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to adopt there was very hard for them. A dirigible having to dock on the Empire State Building is probably not easy. A mooring mast added to the top of the building. Would allow dirigibles to anchor there for several hours for refueling. The obstacles were that Al Smith demanded the builders to make the Empire State Building more tall. Also to make it more ornamental, and to put in like a pyramid at the top. The workers were exhausted. The one obstacle that the builders did was to expand their use in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area. The other obstacles were that the architects and the builders of the Empire State Building consulted with experts, taking tours of the equipment and mooring operations. The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was by nature itself..Yeah!.Hey boy - did you find out   Whatcha had to know - 'n what it's all about   When you started to move - just a step at a time   You never wanted to fall   You took a chance on the wild side   Hey, girl -

"There are a couple of obstacles the builders of the Empire State building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One of these obstacles is that it would add stress to the building's Frame. For example, in paragraph @NUM1 it says, ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame"". Another obstacle was that the steel would have to be modified. ""The steel of the Empire State building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation."" These are some obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to alow dirigibles to dock there..""Daddy you're a fool to cry   You're a fool to cry   And it makes me wonder why""      You know, I got a woman   And she lives in the poor part of town   And I go see her sometimes   And we make love, so fine   I put my head on her shoulder   She says, ""Tell me all your troubles""   You know what she says?.Baby Whoa...

"Although the builders of the Empire State Building managed some of the obstacles with allowing dirigibles to dock there, many of the issues were left unsolved. When designing the mast to accommodate the blimp, the architects realized the pressure this would put on the building's frame. In order to support the weight of the dirigible they needed to make ""over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications"" (paragraph @NUM1) to the structure of the building. Also, the builders had to develop a way to tether the dirigible to the building to allow passengers and supplies to unboard. Therefore, the architects designed a ""rocket-shaped mast... of shiny aluminum... which also housed elevators and stairs"" (paragraph @NUM2). However, the builders forgot to incorporate the winds at the top of the building. Once the front of the dirigible was docked, the back of the blimp would swivel around irradically. Furthermore, the builders disregarded existing laws that banned dirigibles from flying low over cities, as it states in paragraph @NUM3. This precaution was due to the safety hazard that these dirigibles posed since they were highly flammable from the hydrogen used. These imposing obstacles made the use of the Empire State Building is a dock unrealistic..She can't see nothing nothing at all   She can't see nothing, nothing at all   Dilate, Dial-ate.It's that sweet little mystery that's in your heart   It's just that sweet little mystery that makes me cry   Oh that sweet little mystery that's in your heart   It's just that sweet little mystery that makes me try..I can't believe it, I can't believe it..CHORUS.We knew the world would not be the same..Not the drums, but everyone else."".Reggae!.They'd laugh at me   Please set me free..Well, let's forget all that   And give me the number if you can find it   So I can call just to tell 'em I'm fine and to show   I've overcome the blow, I've learned to take it well   I only wish my words could just convince myself   That it just wasn't real   But that's not the way it feels      Operator, could you help me place this call?"
"It was once said ""were there is a will there is a way"". How ever they didn't include the part about the obstacles you will have to go through. For instance how the was a will & way for the docking of dirigibles on the Empire state building, the architects just didn't work out all the possible problems of their idea. Like the fact that only American dirigibles used helium instead of hydrogen. Also that the wind currents have a stronger force that high up in the air than to regular life level. Also the un-ideal place they were trying to use. They should've taken heed to the businessman's slogan ""@CAPS1, @CAPS1, @CAPS1."".Won't we look pretty in the ballroom   Won't we look pretty in the ballroom   Won't we look pretty in the ballroom   Earlye in the mornin'..They're driving me crazy here      Gotta get out of here...

"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" the builders of the empire state building would of faced many consequences in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. A regular sized diriglbe where made of ""enormous steel framed ballons."" They went as fast as ""eighty miles per hour, and could cruise at seventy per hour. The Empire State Building's would of faced the ""building dangling high above pedestrians on the street, was neither practical nor safe"". And even if the dirigibe landed their the ship would ""swivel around and around"" which would of made the building more move-able. Even if the ship would land their it was ""illegal for a ship to ever tie up the building or even approach the area..I tumble into space, try to stop the fall   My body ripped and tore, I could have floated in space      Could have floated      I stumble 'round my home   I am on the outside My legs and arms are lead, feeling love from no one   Could have floated My head weighs ninety-pounds and I've been down   My friends are aliens and I've been down   Well now I've got no wife Cut a lizard's tail, it grows back to life   I killed some sleepless nights, my heart's torn to pieces   Could have floated I am the funny guy, yeah I've been down   I am the big rock star yeah I've been down   I'll never be the same, cause I've been inside out   And I want to be an animal and take care of my own   My head weighs ninety pounds and I've been down   My friends are aliens and I've been down   I know what it's like cause I've been down Devil sneaks in and deals and I've been down.For years I've seen you fighting   Against your heart   Living like you're dying   So far from the sun      Waiting for a guardian angel   To lead you through the dangers   That lie ahead on your way   Towards tomorrows arms      Tears have turned from sweet to sour and hours to days   You're hiding yourself away   From our cruel world's embrace   And as your days turn to weeks   You'll cry yourself to sleep   In the cage      We all have our fears but yours are   The scariest of them all   Lift your head and let us taste   The horror you adore      And it all starts to makes sense   All the blood wisely shed   Just wait until the cure comes knocking on your door      Tears have turned from sweet to sour and hours to days   You're hiding yourself away   From our cruel world's embrace   And as your days turn to weeks   You'll cry yourself to sleep   In the cage you're locked in      Tears have turned from sweet to sour and hours to days   You're hiding yourself away   From our cruel world's embrace   And as your days turn to weeks   You'll cry yourself to sleep   In the cage   And as your days turn to weeks   You'll cry yourself to sleep   In the cage you've locked yourself in.Because you are..Oh boatman, I am the river,   I am the mountain and the sea..Les yeux vers le ciel   Une?.Try to see it my way,   Only time will tell if I am right or I am wrong..Oh, oh why can't I reach you?.what's my name?.You say you're confused   And all of your friends   Asking you why   You act like you do   The faster you run   The farther you're behind   It goes to show   Take it easy slow   I think you'll like what you find   Hey hey   You paint on your face   Eager to please   And take your place   Now outside   So sadly to find   All of your pictures there   Were painted by the blind   Goes to show   Take it easy slow   I think you'll like what you find   Like what you find   Was a time when   The world was turnin' slower   You could sit back   Enjoy it, growin' older   And now when you go   It's twice the speed of sound   Everyone is gettin' much smarter   How come life's gettin' much harder   Take it easy, baby   Take it slow   You say you're confused   And all of your friends   They keep askin' why you   Why you act like you do   And maybe you do   But it's no good to cry   It only goes to show   Take it easy slow   I think you'll like what you find   Like what you find   Takin' it slow   Slow, slow, slow   Take it easy   Takin' it slow   Slow, slow, slow   Take it easy   Take   Take, take it, takin' it easy   Takin' it slow   Slow, slow, slow   Take it easy   Takin' it slow   Slow, slow, slow   Take it easy   Takin' it slow   Slow, slow, slow   Take it easy"
"Other than making ammendments to building plans, the builders of the empire state building faced obstacles in safety, practicality, and legality. The hydrogen used in most foreign dirigibles is highly flammable, posing as an extreme safety hazard ""above a densely populated area such as downtown New York."" Also, due to natural, violent wind currents at the altitude of the mooring mast, it would be more difficult, and dangerous, to weigh down docking dirigibles. Lastly, the building plans for the Empire State building did not correspond to existing laws. Laws forbade airships from traveling at low altitudes over urban areas; therefore the use of the mooring mast would be illegal. Before the builders were able to finish the Empire state building, they had to carefully consider each of these obstacles..Eyes over the city   Rise up from your soul   They hang over the streets at night   Brought on by the cold      We live with the numbers   Mining our dreams for the same old song   Why hope for the turning   If everything you know is wrong      [Chorus]   So come on, shake your rag doll, baby   Before you change your mind   Then come on, when the rapture takes me   Be the fallen angel by my side      You carry the lantern   I'll carry you home   You search for the disappeared   I'll bury the cold      Yours is a messiah   Mine is a dream and it won't be long   No hope for the journey   If no-one ever sees the dawn      So come on, shake your rag doll, baby   Before you change your mind   Then come on, when the rapture takes me   Will you be by my side      [Chorus]      So come on, shake your rag doll, baby   Before you change your mind   Then come on, when the rapture takes me   Will you be by my side      Hey come on, shake your rag doll, baby   Before you change your mind   And come on, when the rapture takes me   Be the fallen angel by my side      (Shake your rag doll baby)   (Shake it 'round)   (Shake your rag doll baby)   (Shake it 'round).You're no angel, I'm no saint, if we were   We wouldn't be in this place tonight      Lost and lonely, scared and confused   We both have a past, nothing to lose, tonight   Well it cuts like a knife these bad luck blues   We both got scars from the hell we been through   Somebody's gotta win, somebody's gotta lose      So let's roll the dice, one more time   Take a chance on love again tonight   Risk it all, lay it on the line   Let the skeletons fight for life   Tonight, hold on tight, as we collide      Reconnected, feelin' no pain   Seeking shelter like a spark in the rain, tonight (ooh yeah)   Worn and weathered, scared to go home   We're here together, but still all alone, tonight (uh uh yeah)   And there's no need to lie, we've both been abused   The love and the pain, the cocaine and booze, now   Most people don't, but some people do      So let's roll the dice, one more time   Take a chance on love again tonight   Risk it all, lay it on the line   Let the skeletons fight for life   Tonight, hold on tight, as we collide.[Verse:]   Stare in the face of the grim death   Screaming monsters bring me to deafness   My dagger and swagger are useless in the faze of the mirror   When the mirror is made of my face      [Chorus:]   This is the house of death   Where even angels die in arms of daemons   This is the house of death   Where even angels die in arms from a daemon...

"In this short passage, it discusses how architects want to build a mooring mast on the Empire State Building in the state of New York. This mast would dock dirigibles, which in modern day they're called blimps. The mooring mast is a skinny tower at the top of the Empire State Building to dock the Dirigibles. Empire State Building stands @NUM1 feet tall without the mooring mast at peak.The stress of a dirigible on a mooring mast at @NUM2 feet is a lot of weight at that high of a structure. They put @MONEY1 of modifications into this deal for the base area of the building.An important downfall about the dirigibles are that with helium in them, they're very flammable and could cost several millions in damage. If the zeppelin caught on flame over such a densely populated land area, that could take a large amount of lives.I think the mooring mast was a great idea and it helped the building be the tallest building at one time. They should still use the mooring mast today..In the park or walking down the high way,   Baby, baby, can't you hear my heartbeat?.alright!.Wish you were here..We're just a habit   Like saccharin..Up early, smokin' and plottin'   Looking at these lames being thankful I'm not them   This year couple million out the game   And you're wondering how I got them   I got it from going hard, I always stay on my job   Wanna get high you should come to my spot then   And smoke with some heavyweight niggas   Jets, Taylor Gang nigga losing's not a option   Now I'm always on the road   And everywhere I go people asking what I'm rocking   I tell em this is next year's fresh and this year's best   And some shit you niggas not in, so quit copyin'      Yeah man   You niggas got it confused, trying to do what the fuck we do   That's not the point   The point is for you to do you   It's a beautiful thing      I'm in the regal, you in a rut   Stuck, can't come up   Old, jealous niggas hatin' on us   Bitches is wishin' you'd shut the fuck up   I'm in the position, set my niggas up tough   What the fuck, just jump   Continents I promise it   I could go from bucks to billions in a minute   Made a split second decision   Executed with precision   I feel attention when I walk in the room   Old cuddly ass niggas go to hidin' they woman   Thinkin' I'mma walk up to 'em, but I don't do it   Baby girl know the big shit from the manure   I could help you shine like a jeweler   Candy paint make an old whip newer.Singled out the kids who are mean to me   Get straight A's but they still make fun   I don't give a, I'll laugh last   Stayed in every night      Do my homework so I'll be smart   Girls all say I'm a little fucked   Mommy I'm a good boy   Mommy I'm a fuckin' savior   Mommy I'm alive      Mommy, can I go out and kill tonight      Rip the veins from human necks   Until they're wet with life   Razor-blades love teenage flesh   An epidermoty   I'll bring back a souvenir   For it's my mommy's dream   Can I go out and kill tonight, kill tonight   Killed a girl on lovers' lane   I kept her toes and teeth   Every night I stalk around until I find my keep   I'll bring back a souvenir   For it's my mommy's dream      Can I go out and kill tonight, kill tonight      Killed a girl on lover's lane   I kept her toes and teeth   Every night I stalk around until I find my keep   I'll bring back a souvenir   For it's my mommy's dream      Can I go out and kill tonight, kill tonight   Kill tonight, kill tonight, kill tonight, kill tonight      Kill tonight, kill tonight   Kill tonight, kill tonight, kill tonight, kill tonight   Can I go out and kill tonight, kill tonight   Mommykill tonight, kill tonight.Do you see that tunnel showing any sign of light   Does fear still wake you in the night      Do you still dream?.The rhythm divine   Giving, loving, rolling, revving ?.You gotta trust someone      Trust someone   Someone to trust."
"Throughout the excerpt, obstacles the builders faced were difficult. Many fell under being able to let dirigibles dock there. Some difficulties the faced were that outside from the states, more dirigibles were being made, but with ""hydrogen rather than helium"". they stated, ""hydrogen is highly flamable"". There was fear for the people, since New York was so densely populated. There were also whether problems. Winds were constantly shifting. ""Ship would swival around and around"". Realizing the danger, all they could do was shut it down..Do you wanna see it all?.I could feel changes comin' on..If you want a good gal to stay around   You gotta treat her nice and kind   If you do her wrong she'll leave this town   And you'll almost lose your mind   Then you'll moanin' moa-oanin' the blues..Time that we own it..Who do you think I am?.My love is the lasting kind so you   Better come and take it..You know that heaven...

"When the builders of the Empire State Building attempted to construct a mooring mast for dirigibles, they were faced with several obstacles that would ultimately defeat them. The first and most obvious obstacle was the danger of crashing. When the Hindenburg crashed in New Jersey, the builders realized how much worse the horrific crash would have been in downtown New York. Another more present obstacle was the wind at the top of the tower. As said in paragraph @NUM1 ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" That coupled with the lightweight nature of dirigibles would make mooring much more difficult than on an open field. The last obstacle faced by builders was the existing laws that made it illegal. There were laws that prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas like New York City, though they were largely ignored. All those obstacles eventually lead to the realization that the mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building was not practical or feasible..Everybody got some soul   I don't care if they're young or old   Gotta hold on when all is gone   Make out like it's fine      While we say yeah (bad or good)   Oh yeah (bad or good)   Yeah (bad or good)   Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah (bad or good)   That'll ever happen (bad or good)   Everybody (bad or good) sometimes   Oh, oh yeah      Don't even have to say one word   And it ain't nothing that we've seen or heard   Get out, get out, jump and shout   They'd like to know what it's all about      Just say yeah (bad or good)   Oh yeah (bad or good)   And it's alright baby (bad or good)   It's gonna happen (bad or good)   Everybody (bad or good)   Sometimes (bad or good)   Some sweet time, oh-oh      If there's something baby   You want me to do   Come on over here and I'll see about you   Yeah I'll make ya shake it all about   Jump and shout      Just say yeah (bad or good)   Oh yeah (bad or good)   Whoa oh (bad or good, bad or good)   That'll happen, everybody (bad or good)   Sometime (bad or good)      At sometime (bad or good)   Oh yeah yeah (bad or good)   Oh yeah (bad or good).Groove..See me, feel me, touch me, heal me!.Rejected!.I don't know you but I think I hate you   You're the reason for my misery   Strange, how you've become my biggest enemy   I have never even seen your face      Maybe it's just jealousy   Mixed up with a violent mind   A circumstance that doesn't make much sense   Or maybe I'm just dumb      You're the cloud hanging out over my head   Hail comes crashing down welting my face   Magic man, egocentric plastic man   Yet you still got one over on me.Oh, oh, keep you like an oath,   May nothing but death do us part..Hang everything      We'd risk life and limb   To keep you in the swim   Yes we'd do anything   Anything?.When you got an old mem'ry that refuses to die you need love   When you feel someone special has long passed you by you need love   When you've lived the lifetime in a night still there's darkness above   There's no way to measure the almighty power of a good woman's love..You and your sweet smile   You and your tantalizing ways   You and your honey lips   You and all the sweet things that they say   You and your wild wild ways   One day you just up and walked away   You left me hurting      But I can forgive you for that now   You taught me something   Something took half my life to learn   When you give all yourself away   Just tell them to be careful of your heart      Be careful of my heart, heart   Be careful of this heart of mine   Be careful of my heart, heart   It just might break and send some splinters flying   Be careful of my heart, heart   Be careful      You you you   You you you   You you you   Took my love   Thought you took it all      You you you   You you you   You you you   Took my love   And now you're gone      But I'm not breaking down   And I'm not falling apart   I just lost a little faith   When you broke my heart   Given a chance I might try it again   But I wouldn't risk it all this time      I'd save   A little love for myself   Enough for my heart to mend   A little love for myself   One day I just might love again   One day some sweet smile might turn my head   One day I just might give all myself away   One day   One day   One day"
"Based on the information I just read the obstacles the builders had of the empire building, was to find a way to allow the dirigibles to dock there. There are rooms that have been never opened to public and is the highest observation desk. They had to make room for a dock but they didnt know how to. The builders faced was the city didnt want ""dirigibles to moor at the empire state building because the law agianst airships flying to low over urban areas. They also had complications the captain of the dirigibles shell could not let go of the control levers. The sharp spires of other buildings could pop the dirigibles. The wind was also a problem as it could take the dirigibles a different dirrection..Well we realized so long, long ago, and I bet you,   That we've seen it all, the lies won't get you..I just want to talk to you   I won't uh, do you no harm   I just want to know about your diff'rent lives   On this is here people farm   I heard some of you got your families   Living in cages tall and cold   And some just stay there and dust away   Past the age of old..Well you just step right up, you sexy thing   Tell me what's been goin' on in that funky little brain   Come dance with the devil   You want it when it's gonna cost you   'cause nothing comes for free   When you're living in a human zoo      Chorus   Dance sister dance through the human zoo   You're such a mess now, girl   Look what they've done to you....Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah   Will you love me?.Country music singers, have always been a real close family,   But lately some of my kinfolks have disowned a few others and me..Early in the morning   The sun was up and the sky was very blue,   Without a warning,   As I looked out, my thoughts returned to you,   A noise in the city made the children run,   And hide themselves away,   And thunder boomed and lightning filled the sky..There's a fire inside everyone of us,   You'd better need it now,   I got to hold it, yeah,   I better use it till the day I die..I had the blues and my baby, she knew   She's holdin' little piece of mind..We have a random on the westside   Personality malfunction   He says I can't give you anything at all   Just a room with a bad view of you      He sent a letter to a downstat   Saying sorry that I missed you   But I can't think of anything to do   He's addicted to the time track      We have a technical   We have a technical      He's in a hotel where they all go   Saying me, I've lost my memory   It's so surprising   Just how quickly things can end      Like a hero on a platform of friends   This table is so crowded   With people that I don't know   And I never really turn      My thoughts on you   So the image breaks down again      We have a technical   We have a technical      I suppose it's very shady   At least until the lights go out   Advertising posters on the wall   And the young ones singing softly      Do they ever come back   Or is it always at the wrong time   I could crawl around the floor   Just like I'm real   And move a hand in front of my eyes      We have a technical   We have a technical"
"In the story The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The @NUM1 main obstacles the builders faced where, hydrogen being highly flammable. The second main reason was winds from nature itself. The last reason was the law against airships.The first main obstacle the builders were faced with was there was hydrogen and helium in the balloon and the hydrogen was highly flammable, so the builders needed to make a safe place for the dirigibles to dock. The second main obstacle the builders were faced with was nature itself. The winds from on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. The last obstacle the builders were faced with was the existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas.

One of the greatest obstacles they had to face were the winds at the top of the building because the winds were constantly Shifting due to violent air currents. It also was'nt safe having the dirigibles weighed down with lead weights so it wont swivel around the mooring mast.

"The obstacles that the builder faced is making sure that the building was stable enough. The architects knew that they could not just drop a mooring mast on the Empire State Building. Al Smith commented and said that the mooring mask was on a okay level and how they were working on things. A set of engineers are working finding a workable and faster arrangements. While, the government is trying to find out a safe way for the mooring airships to mast. ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame (@NUM1). The obstacles that the builders went through was if a big dirigible was to go on top of the building it was add stress by weighing it down. Also, it would get to the point where it would reach the frame of the building. They had to use a steel frame in order for things to work out. But, at the top of the building the winds cause violent shifting out to air currents. Having a dirigible dangling over pedestrians is very unsafe or even good.

"When building the mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building, the architects experienced many obstacles. These obstacles lead the designers to never effectively use the mooring mast like they had hoped to. The first problem they had, was that a thousand ton dirigible would add stress to the buildings frame. The designers had to spend @MONEY1 to reinforce the building's frameworks. This first obstacle already put doubt into the builders minds, that this was not going to happen easily. The next thing they realized, was that with hydrogen dirigibles is that they were extremely flamable. If a huge dirigible were to catch fire and fall onto New York City it would be cataustrophic. This also leasoned their enthusiasm about the work, knowing about how great a risk this would be. The wind above the building were constantly Shifting due to air currents, and this would toss and turn the dirigible tethered to the mast. The designers relized this would be neither practical or safe being over pedestrians on the ground. The last obstacle of all, that really killed their mooring idea, was airship laws. The law states that the dirigibles cannot fly that low over urban areas, so that puts an illegal mark on their plans. The designers of the mooring mast had to face many obstacles in their design, and it was these obstacles that led to the never useing of their mast..is waiting in the wind   For all your world and treasures   There's nothing to be want   Nothing left to measure   It's you and me and the colour of the sun      While the child wonders how   The sky connects to the ocean   Spinning fast, and that's now   She's unaware of the motion   The wise men and the fools keep taking turns   Every day more bridges seem to burn   With all your volts and treasures   Would you trade them for some fun?.Deep inside of me, I know there's      Feelings come and go, I've never known.Dear, dear will they really laugh at me?.Chorus:   Why you plan, girl?.London calling at the top of the dial   And after all this, won't you give me a smile?.What you wanna do baby?.That was then and this is now   I found my way back here somehow   Knew you'd have to let me go   I told you once I told you so      [Chorus]   Take me down   You can hold me but you   Can't hold what's within   Pull me round   Push me to the limit   Maybe I may bend   But I know where I'm not going   I will not be broken   I will not be broken   I will not be      Someone other than who I am   I will fight to make my stand   Cause what is livin' if I can't live free      What is freedom if I can't be me      [Chorus]      I won't let you near it   I will let my spirit fly   Fly   High   Oh take me down      Take me down   You can hold me but you   Can't hold what's within   Pull me round   Push me to the limit   Maybe I may bend   But we both know where I'm not going   I will not be broken   I will not be broken   I will not be.PURANAS: The Ancient probes still further into the past beyound the point of   remembering..(chorus)   Rat-a-tat tat Rat-a-tat tat,   Out of the trench into combat,   Covered in bruises covered in cuts,   Turning the page for more blood and guts      Kamicaze crashes plane,   Shits himself but all in vain,   Fix the mine under the tray,   And get away in time again,   The cap-I-tan is on the bridge,   Pulls the pin from his sandwich."
"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, many obstacles were described that got in the way of allowing dirigibles to dock on The Empire State Building. One obstacle was that the Empire State Building had a flat roof and the framework of the building would have to be made stronger to put the mooring mast on there. The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof."" It cost more than @MONEY1 to modify the framework. Another obstacle was the law. ""flying to low over urban areas"" was illegall so it would be impossible for a dirigible to even go near the Empire State Building. Lastly, the biggest obstacle was safety. Blimps that were being flown around New York were made using hydrogen, which is flamable. Also, ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" It wouldn't be safe to hook a blimp up in those winds where it would be shifting all around. Ofcourse, it was also a safety hazard because thousands of pedestrians would be walking on the road below, ""Where [the dirigibles] would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street,"" it would be terrible if one fell. It should have been obvious that hooking dirigibles to a mast on the Empire State Building was not going to work..The street is dark here while I walk alone,   An' since you've gone, I always walk alone..(Nat)   After I kinda straighten my tie,   She has to borrow my comb,   One kiss then we continue again,   Walking my baby back home..What if the paint chips from the wall?.Real nice to know that you care   To leave me soaking wet   I'm so surprised you would dare   You make me wanna forget (make me wanna forget)      I could forget your pride   I could forget your wondering eyes   I could forget about the way you made me feel   You talk so condescendingly   I could forget how you would try to get the best of me   You'll never forget that you never got me!.Some people say this town don't look   Good in snow   You don't care, I know      Ventura Highway in the sunshine   Where the days are longer   The nights are stronger   Than moonshine   You're gonna go I know      'Cause the free wind is blowin' through   Your hair   And the days surround your daylight   There   Seasons crying no despair   Alligator lizards in the air      Wishin' on a falling star   Watchin' for the early train   Sorry boy, but I've been hit by   Purple rain   Aw, come on Joe, you can always   Change your name   Thanks a lot son, just the same      Ventura Highway   In the sunshine   Where the days are longer   The nights are stronger   Than moonshine   You're gonna go I know      'Cause the free wind is blowin' through   Your hair   And the days surround you daylight   There   Seasons crying no despair   Alligator lizards in the air.I need a woman to treat me good   And give me everything a good woman should   Everyday and every night   She'd be waiting on her brown-eyed boy   To come and treat her right      I'm a love hunter baby   Sneaking up on you,   I'm a love hunter baby   Sneaking up on you   I'm gonna give you all my loving   And use my tail on you      In my time I've been a back door man,   I've taken everything I could   But, I've given all I can   I don't want no woman   To weep or moan,   I'm looking for a sweet heartbreaker   And I'm never gonna leave her alone      I'm a love hunter baby   Sneaking up on you,   I'm a love hunter baby   What you gonna do?.You're all that I love and all I know      The question is plain   Could our love still remain   Without its carnal ecstasy?.You know I feel so bad, children   Feel like a ballgame on a rainy day   Yes, I do, y'all      Don't you know I feel so bad, children   Oh, Lord, like a ballgame on a rainy day      Whoa, since I lost my woman   You see I have to shake my head   And then I walk away   I have to walk away      Y'all listen to this      I just wanna tell you people   I wanna tell you just how I feel   Can you hear me now      I wanna tell all you people out there   I wanna tell you just how I feel   Oh, how I feel      I feel so bad, I feel so bad   Because my women   She gave me a dirty deal   The child messed up my mind   Oh, yes, she did      Now listen, y'all   I got one more thing   I want to talk to you about   Wait a minute      Sometimes I want to leave here   Then again I want to stay, yeah   Did you hear what I said      Sometimes I want to leave   This town, yes, I do   Then again I want to stay      You see, the thing is   I already got my suitcase packed up   So I guess I'll have to catch a train   And then I'll ride away      Said I'm gonna move   Gonna move on   Gonna move on   Lord, I wanna move      Since the woman been gone   I ain't had no love   That's what I want   That's what I need      A little dab'll do me   Ooh, sock it to me, Lord   Somebody help me   Help me find my way....Won't be released 'til I'm good and finished."
" The firsts obstacles was to make the Empire State building the worlds tallest building by adding a top or a hat to make the building a little more taller.

"There were many obstacles faced by the builders in the creation of the mast. One obstacle was the building's flat roof. A dirigible that was moored to the building by a single cable, would cause stress for the building's frame to be stressed. Due to this the builders had to modify and strengthen the frame to solve this obstacle. Another problem was that other countries still used hydrogen and an explosion over New York would be devastating.One of the greatest obstacles was ""nature itself."" Winds at the top were constantly changing. The back of the ship would move around  the mooring mast. They had to solve this in a safe manner. In fields the back of a dirigible would be weighed down by lead, but this could not be done. It would be unsafe to allow the lead to dangle over civilians' heads. On top of all these obstacles, there was a law against airships flying too low over urban areas. In the end the mooring mast was a failure because not all these obstacles could be solved and fixed..It's dark and eerie   And it's really late   Come on kid's don't hesitate   We're going down to the underground   We're going down we're going down   To the underground      The Hades ladies are dressed to kill   Dagger glares from Richard hell   Tension heightening heating frightening   Thunder rolls as fast as lightning      If you've got the urge   Come on let's submerge      The subterranean is a bottomless pit   The vinyl vultures are after it   Molten lava sulfur vapors   Smolder on to obliterate us      If you've got the urge   Come on let's submerge.I'm steppin' out   I'm movin' on   I'm gonna see the world   Like a rollin' stone   I'm gonna be somebody   Oh, I'm steppin' out..Straw can bury us   We can carry the hay   But straws can break   Like the reasons for my behavior      Straws mend   And straws bend   And dry ones catch like   A secret worth never paid for      Strong muscles   My strong muscles   Plowman, come and dig my farm   It's only making my body sneeze      Straw      Straw can bury us   We can carry us   But you better jump right now   Cause these brakes left some sparks   And now the wagon's caught fire      Let's jump up on the camel's back   Not one straw there gonna break his back   Not one straw there gonna break his back   Just the weight of five short men      Let's jump up on the camel's back   Not one straw there gonna break his back   Not one straw there gonna break his back   Just the weight of six young men.Remember, will you remember?).I'm not tryin' to cause a b-b-big sensation...talkin' 'bout my generation...

One set of engineer here in New York is trying to dope out a practical, workable arrangement and the Government people in Washington are figuring on some safe way of mooring airships to this mast"" it seems like hes confused about the whole situation..I said, y'all having a good time out there?.Well I see you in the morning   Putting on your pretty clothes   And I watch you do your make-up   Like they do in all those fashion shows   Then you turn to me so that I can see   If you put yourself together right   Then you go away and you're gone all day   But I know you're coming home tonight   And when you're home,   Darling all you've got to be is you   But when in Rome, do as the Romans do      Well it's alright if you're tired   When your day is done   You can see when you look at me,   You're not the only one   It's a cold, cruel world for a working girl   But you can't let them see you cry   It's a fact of life, now man and wife   Work full time to just get by   And when we're home all   It's gonna be is me and you   But when in Rome, do as the Romans do      I've done some strange things I   Never thought I'd do before   But if the strain brings happiness,   More or less..Now lookahere   When you at home alone   The blues will taunt you constantly, yessuh   Ba dit dit deet   And when you're out in a crowd   The Blues will haunt your memories   Bah da doh doh zet      The nights when you don't sleep, Yes, ha ha ha   The whole night you cryin'   But you can't forget her, oh yes   Soon you even stop tryin'      Man, you walk the floor   And wear out your shoes, sss   When you feel your heart break, yeah brother   That's when you're learning the blues      Yes   When you at home alone, the blues will taunt you constantly, yes      And when you're out in a crowd, the Blues will haunt your memories      The nights when you don't sleep, hmm, Ella   Ella: The whole night you're crying   Louis: Yeah, but you can't forget her   Ella: Soon you even stop trying      Louis: Yes Man, you'll walk the floor, that's when it's rough   And wear out that last pair a' treaders, ha ha   Together: When you feel your   heart break      You're learnin the blues.Any way you want   I'm gonna prove my love for you..Honey, take me by the hand and play that game again..I got a funny feelin' that all of you girls   Had better hold on to your man..Won't you please bring my baby to me?.He told me this guy named Rocky would pick him up in a station wagon,   Him and some other boys, and he'd take 'em out to some strange neighborhood   And drop 'em off and he gave them this whole spiel to give their potential customers..Kill the father!!!"
"In ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION1, there were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State building were faced with in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. There were obstacles such as the fact that if a dirigible were tied to the building by a single tether it would ""add stress to the building's frame."" To fix the problem, over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the building. Another problem was that some dirigibles used hydrogen rather than helium. Hydrogen is highly flammable which would be very dangerous to have over a densely populated area. The ""greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" By this, Lüsted means that there are many violent air currents at the top of the building, meaning that the ship would swivel around and around. To make sure this would not happen, lead wieghts would have to be used which would not be practical or safe to have ""dangling high above pedestrians."" In the end, people realized there were far too many problems involved in the use of a mooring mast at the top of the Empire State building..I wanna hold you so much..And God said, 'Oh child, of course

"The builders of the Empire State Building had various problems to @CAPS1 in allowing dirigibles to dock there. The nature of the ships, added stress to the building and safety were all against the ludicrous idea of landing blimps on the Empire State Building.The nature of the ships would cause the body to sway in the wind. One problem that comes from this is tangling the mooring cable. To combat this captains would have to use lead counterweights. These were highly impractical to use because they would hanging over crowded streets.Another problem was added stress to the buildings Foundation. Since the building was not ordinarily designed for this role, modifications would have to be made to its foundation. The cost of these renovations was over sixty thousand dollars.The most obvious problem was safety. These airships were filled with highly flammable hydrogen. The area surrounding the building had other buildings with sharp spires on top. If a ship hit one of these, there was no stopping the disaster..Oh my son, I am only your brother..Ow!).This girl is made of lipstick   Powder and paint   Sees the pictures of herself   Every magazine on every shelf      This girl is maid of Bond Street   Hailing cabs, lunches with executives   Gleaming teeth sip aperitifs      This girl is a lonely girl   Takes the train from Paddington to Oxford Circus   Buys the Daily News   But passengers don't smile at her, don't smile at her      This girl is made of loneliness   A broken heart   For the boy that she once knew   Doesn't want to know her any more      And this girl is a lonely girl   Every thing she wants is hers   But she can't make it with the boy she really wants to be with   All the time, to love, all the time      This boy is made of envy   Jealousy   He doesn't have a limousine   Really wants to be a star himself      This girl, her world is made of flashlights and films   Her cares are scraps on the cutting room floor      And maids of Bond Street drive round in chauffered cars   Maids of Bond Street picture clothes, eyes of stars   Maids of Bond Street shouldn't have worldly cares   Maids of Bond Street shouldn't have love affairs.Some people run cause they don't like the smell..To be on your own, with no direction home   Like a complete unknown, like a rolling stone.She gone and left me,   She gone to stay..You got a dream, you've got it bad   But it's just another one of those fads   Just a joke, gone up in smoke   Leaves you dangling on the end of a rope   Lost your money in a parking lot   It was funny but it's all you've got   You're walking home, with sticky clothes   And a very healthy overdose   Oh Johnny it's you and you're a love child   Oh Johnny it's you and you're a love child   Ain't got no shoes   Ain't got no job   Ain't got no decent banks to rob   Ain't got no rent   You pitch a tent   But the parking meter money's spent   You need a girlfriend like a kick in the head   Sleeping all night solo with the grateful dead   Yeah you know it ain't easy   Oh Johnny it's you yeah Johnny it's you and you're a love child   Oh Johnny it's you yeah Johnny it's you and you're a love child   Chorus repeats   You've got a dream, you've got it bad   But it's just another one of those fads   It's just a joke, gone up in smoke   Leaves you dangling on the end of a rope   You're walking home, with stiky clothes   And a very healthy overdose   Yeah you know it ain't easy   Oh Johnny it's you yeah Johnny it's you and you're a love child   Oh Johnny it's you yeah Johnny it's you and you're a love child.Promises are easy made..But I ain' a-got Corrina,   Life don't mean a thing."
"Based on the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon @CAPS1 the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. These obstacles include the weather, safety, previous dirigible tragety, and the law.The wind at the top of the Empire State building was a huge safty hazard because even if the dirigible was secured the back would swing a cause a potential hazzard due to the unpredictable winds. To fly a dirigible they are filled with hydrogen instead of helium, this is also dangerous because hydrogen is very flammable. On May, 6, 1937 the hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, @LOCATION3, so the owners took into consideration this could have been much worse if the accident had taken place above a densely populated area such as New York. Dirigibles are very unsafe so this created many obsticles for the builders of the Empire State Building to allow dirigible to dock there..And the sun will shine   If just for you   And the love.Which hoe is next?.Bang!.Driving through the night,   Tears are running down my face,   I start to realize, all the things that I once said,   I promised you the world   It's nothing more than you deserve   It's killing me inside, to know I put you through this hell,      Take away my heart,   It doesn't want to work no more   I never meant to make you cry,      [Chorus]   California calling 20 miles to go,   And I don't, I don't know,   Should I turn around or should I leave you alone?.I stand at the mirror and sing   I dare to be different and dream, now I am   Big thunder that rolls on the land forever wild   But still, this feeling inside never die   I'm a metal warrior, I need their cries, War Cry      I'm a soldier, soldier, a soldier of fortune   Ahh, come take a stand   Together we'll let out a cry   I'm a soldier, soldier, a soldier of fortune   Ahh, Come take a stand   Together we'll never say die      Raise your fist and support your rebel outlaws   Cause nobody rides for free   The freedom we lose today, you lose tomorrow   Because freedom means something to us....Yeah!.Well I got my mail late last night   A letter from a girl who found the time to write   To her lonesome boy somewheres in the night   She sent me a railroad ticket too   To take me to her lovin' arms   And the big steel rail   Gonna carry me home to the one I love      Well I bin out here many a long days   I haven't found a place that I could call my own   Not a two bit bed to lay my body on   I bin stood up I bin shook down   I bin dragged into the sand   And the big steel rail   Gonna carry me home to the one I love      Ooooh oooo oo whee hee hee   Ooo ooo ooo ooo ooo ooo oo      Well I bin up tight most every night   Walkin' along the streets of this old town   Not a friend to tell my troubles to   My good old car she done broke down   'Cause I drove it into the ground   And the big steel rail   Gonna carry me home to the one I love      Well I look over yonder across the plain   The big drive wheels are poundin' along the ground   Gonna get on board and I'll be homeward bound   Now I ain't had a home cooked meal   And Lord I need one now   And the big steel rail   Gonna carry me home to the one I love      Ooooh oooo oo whee hee hee   Ooo ooo ooo ooo ooo ooo oo      Now here I am with my head in the sand   Standin' on the broad highway would you give a ride   To a lonesome boy who missed the train last night   I went in town for one last round   And I gambled my ticket away   And the big steel rail   Won't carry me home to the one I love.It seems like I've trusted you   Broken and torn are my heart when I finally see   You and her staying around that corner   Whispers of love have left me so alone   Did you truly love me?.Oh help!"

"In attempting to build a working mooring dock for dirigibles on the Empire State Building the works set themselves a hard task. First they had to make sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications so that the building would withstand the weight and added wind pressure of a moored dirigible. Also, a prexisting law made it immpossible for dirigibles to come as low to the city as they needed to be to dock. Finally constant changes in wind current and other weather made a safe docking at the Empire State Building nearly impossible because the dirigible might get blown into the sharp roofs of nearby buidings and instead of being weighted down by lead like they would when they landed in fields as they normally would, they would be tied up, dangling over pedestrians..I got 11 minutes to go..Baby please don't go, baby please don't go   Don't you leave me here feelin' lonely   Don't you leave me here feelin' low   All I know is what I know   And I know, I love you so   Baby don't go, baby please don't go   I wasn't ready for love to hit me   Hit me right between the eyes   One by one I'm comin' undone   Can't you feel my temperature rise?.I heard you were concerned with my life   I heard you had a lot to say      Motherfuckin', thanks for nothin'      I'm gonna do it if it feels right   I'm gonna do it anyway      Motherfuckin', thanks for comin'      Well I'm sayin'   Don't sa I'm not all right   I'm used and confused and   I'm still puttin up a good fight   I'm still puttin' up a good      F.I.G.H.T., fight, fight, fight      Everybody thinks they know my problems   Everybody knows what's best for me      Don't think that anyone can solve them   Don't think there's anyone but me.Chance to hear you (In the morning)   Amp the party   DJ Skribble Keep It Tight!.Don't know what it means to hold you tight,   Being here alone tonight with you,   It feels so right now..Don't carry the weight of the world,   The weight of the world,   And the weight of the world   The weight of the world,   And the weight of the world      Tonight, is a fireball,   And tonight, oh you're not alone   And tonight, we start again,   Tonight, all the best is yet,   To come..See your face would be my destiny   Now I won't take what you can give to me   This lonely place is all I hope to find   If it weren't for him then you'd be mine..Married men!.The world as our reflection will regain it's circulation,   Our life span will meet our life plan of starpeace."

"The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting dirigibles to dock there include wind, weather, and especially safety issues. The excerpt states ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"". This states that nature was a great obstacle for the plan of dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building. The other largest obstacle was safety. The excerpt says, ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States use hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flamable."" Another main safety concern was that the use of lead weights to anchor the dirigible was neither practical nor safe above the city of pedestrians..[Verse:]   Water You turned into wine   Opened the eyes of the blind   There's no one like You   None like You   Into the darkness You shine   Out of the ashes we rise   There's no one like You   None like You      [Chorus:]   Our God is greater   Our God is stronger   God You are higher than any other   Our God is healer   Awesome in power   Our God, our God      [Verse]   Into the darkness You shine   Out of the ashes we rise   There's no one like You   None like You      [Chorus:] 2x      [Tag] 2x   And if our God is for us, then who could ever stop us?.Lie to me   Tell me that everything will be all right   (Who-o-a) Lie to me   Don't say it didn't mean anything   1-2-3 GO!.Will the world remember you   When you fall?.Help me get my feet back on the ground,   Won't you please, please help me?.And do you know what you want from me?.I'm riding on a wave of love   And I see you in black and white,   But your colours came through tonight..Hold on, hold on   To opportunities you thought long gone   Hold on, hold on   To the could-have-beens and should-have-dones      You can lose yourself along the way   Find there's something new in yesterday      Hold onto your faith and your dreams   Look into yourself and believe   In you      Oh, go on, go on   The stars will guide your journey home, yeah   Oh, it won't be long   'Til you see your diamonds in the stone, yeah      'Cause there's still some magic here tonight   If you just step out into the light      Hold onto your faith and your dreams   Look into yourself and believe      I believe in you, believe in me   I believe in you, believe in me   I believe the truth will set you free, yeah   I believe in you, believe in me      I believe in you, believe in me      (Hold on) Hold on, hold on   To your innocence and your beliefs   Mmm, hold on, hold on   Onto who you are and where you've been      I believe in you, believe in me, yeah   I believe in you, believe in me   Oh, I believe the truth will set you free, yeah, yeah   I believe in you, believe in me      Oh I believe in you, believe in me   Oh I believe in you, believe in me   Yeah I believe the truth will set you free   Oh, I believe in you, believe in me   Oh, whoa, oh yeah, oh yeah      I believe in you (I believe in you)   Darlin', believe in me (Darlin', believe in me)   I believe in you (I believe in you)   Darlin', believe in me (Darlin', believe in me).She was a new mean beauty queen   Money, drugs, magazines   That didn't do nothin'   That didn't do nothin'   They gave her diamonds   Shiny boys, city speak, every toy   That didn't do nothin'   No nothin' for her   You can   Lead a horse to water   But you can't expect it to drink   Now ain't that somethin'   Now ain't that somethin'   Yea when the world is   At you're gate that won't satiate   Why are you crying   If you work for nothing at all?.Mou hitori de arukenai   Toki no kaze ga tsuyosugite   Ah kizu tsuku koto nante   Nareta hazu dakedo ima wa      Ah kono mama dakishimete   Nureta mama no kokoro wo   Kawari tsuzukeru kono toki ni   Kawaranai ai ga aru nara      Will you hold my heart   Namida uketomete   Mou kowaresou na all my heart      Forever love, forever dream   Afureru omoi dake ga   Hageshiku setsunaku jikan wo umetsukusu   Oh!"
"The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon Lüsted describes the problems that the builders of the Empire State Building faced like the amount of stress that the dirigibles would add to the frame of the building. safety issues and laws, and the winds around the mast. Any dirigible would add on tremendous stress to the already constructed frame of the building and builders had to complete ""over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications."" These changes were quickly made, but safety concerns such as a potential fire or ""flying too low over urban areas"", (which was actually illegal), still prevailed. The ""greatest obstacle"" of building the mast was the violent winds that surrounded the Empire State Building. These winds were ""constantly shifting"", making it virtually impossible to stay in one spot without swiveling around the building. In a city as densely populated as New York, it also wasn't even an option to weigh down dirigibles for landing. This list of obstacles is a clear sign that the mooring mast was not properly thought about before construction started. The builders should have focused more on what they had done instead of trying to outdo the expectations of all and do something as ""a higher calling."".If I cried out loud   over sorrows I've Known   And the secrets I've heard   It would ease my mind   Someone sharing the load   But I won't breathe a word      We're two of a kind   Silence and I   We need a chance to talk things over   Two of a kind   Silence and I   We'll find a way to work it out      While the children laughed   I was always afraid   of the Smile of the clown   So I close my eyes   Till I can't see the light   And I hide from the sound      We're two of a kind   Silence and I   We need a chance to talk things over   Two of a kind   Silence and I   We'll find a way to work it out      I can hear the cry   Of the leaf on a tree   As it Falls to the ground   I can hear the call   of an Echoing voice   And there's no one around      We're two of a kind   Silence and I   We need a chance to talk things over   Two of a kind   Silence and I   We'll find a way to work it out.When youre on the down side of love   Where the love turns to hare   We just can't relate   On the down side of love   When youre misunderstood   cause when it hurts you   It hurts you so good..Lady, your love's the only love I need,   And beside me is where I want you to be..One half of the ring did young William show   She ran distracted in grief and woe   Sayin' ""William, William, I have gold in store   For my dark-eyed sailor   For my dark-eyed sailor has proved his honour long""      And there is a cottage by yonder lea   This couple's married and does agree   So maids be loyal when your love's at sea   For a cloudy morning   For a cloudy morning brings in a sunny day..To go back   On the hill beside the track   And try to concentrate..You gotta have cake   You'll have Sunday's with chiquitas   You'll see Venus and Serena, in the Wimbledon Arena   And I can take you (Uncle Charlie, preach!!).Verse 1      Take away the melodies   Take away the songs I sing   Take away all the lights   And all the songs You let me write   Does the man I am today   Say the words You need to say      Chorus      Let them see You   In me   Let them hear You   When I speak   Let them feel You   When I sing   Let them see You   Let them see You   In me      Verse 2      Who am I without Your grace   Another smile, another face   Another breath, a grain of sand   Passing quickly through Your hand   I'd give my life, an offering   Take it all, take everything      Chorus      Let them see You   In me   Let them hear You   When I speak   Let them feel You   When I sing   Let them see You   Let them see You   In me      Bridge      With every breath I breathe   I sing a simple melody   And I pray they'll hear more than a song   In me, in me      Chorus      Let them see You   In me   Let them hear You   When I speak   Let them feel You   When I sing   Let them see You      Ending      Oh, let them see You   In me   Let them hear You   When I speak   Let them feel You   When I sing   Let them see You   Just let them see You in me   Let them see You.(feat..Trick or treat, trick or treat, Give me something good to eat."
"The builders of the Empire State Building faced a few obstacle attempts to allow dirigible to dock there. First the Empire State Building was destined to never fulfill it's purpose because the builders didn't notice all the problems it had. One attempt was the Goodyear blimp Columbia, attempted a publicity stunt where it would tie up and deliver a bundle of newspapers to the Empire State Building, as stated in paragraph @NUM1. In paragraph @NUM2 it states that the greatest obstacle to the successful use of mooring mast was nature itself. The builders had a lot of work to do to actually try and fix the problems but there was just to many. In conclusion the builders of the Empire State Building faced a few obstacle attempts to allow dirigible to dock there..Cause I could get a lot of chicks, the baddest women on my sh..I'll get my peace of mind when you   Hear this song..You told me you loved me   Why did you leave me all alone?.He lies to you and deceives..At a Grotto   In a Field   In The Middle Of The Island.I've got a word or two   To say about the things that you do   Youre telling all those lies   About the good things that   We can have if we close our eyes      Do what you want to do   And go where you're going to   Think for yourself   Cause I wont be there with you      I left you far behind   The ruins of the life that you have in mind   And though you still can't see   I know your minds made up   Youre gonna cause more misery      Do what you want to do   And go where you're going to   Think for yourself   Cause I wont be there with you      Although your minds opaque   Try thinking more if just for your own sake   The future still looks good   And youve got time to rectify   All the things that you should      Do what you want to do   And go where you're going to   Think for yourself   Cause I wont be there with you      Do what you want to do   And go where you're going to   Think for yourself   Cause I wont be there with you      Think for yourself   Cause I wont be there with you.I know you're standing!.""HEY!"".But now, a, now, now, now, I'm the sad and lonely one."
"The builders of the empire state building ran into a lot of problems involving the dirigibles.  One problem is that there was no easy way to make such a suitable docking station at such a great height, while making it look good.  The other, most main reason/problem with the mast for mooring the dirigibles was just a safety issue.  But a big one.  Most dirigibles used hydrogen instead of helium and hydrogen is extremely flammable.  So, if something were to go wrong with docking the dirigible could catch fire and explode & go down in a densely populated area.  There were a lot of safety and structure issues but they were eventually resolved, (like the fact that large lead weights needed to dangle over the streets to weigh down the back of the dirigible.We have the chance to turn the pages over   We can write what we want to write   We gotta make ends meet, before we get much older   We're all someone's daughter We're all someone's son   How long can we look at each other Down the barrel of a gun?.Always when I needed you   You were strong!.Set in overdrive, makin' money on the side..I am justified..Now all I want to know   Will the eyes inside the back of your mind let it go?.Give the kids a hand   Down on the sand..The sun is fading in the west   Out where the cattle roam   I'm like a bird at the end of the day   Flying to my home   I'm flying to my home sweet majesty   I'm flying to my home      The sky is like a painted flag   Above a sea of chrome   I've got a woman living in my life   Living in my home   I'm flying to my home sweet majesty   I'm flying to my home      I haven't been back for so long   I don't know if I'm going to recognise it   They gave the old place a new face   And I'm going to take some time   To size the situation up      I haven't been back for so long   I don't know if I'm going to recognise it   They gave the old place a new face   And I'm going to take some time   To size the situation up      The sun is fading in the west   Out where the cattle roam   I've got a woman living in my life   Living in my home   I'm flying to my home sweet majesty   I'm flying to my home   I'm flying to my home   I'm flying to my home   I'm flying to my home   I'm flying to my home sweet majesty   I'm flying to my home....Don't distract me.

"The builders of the Empire State Building had a few obstacles to face when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there, as written by Marcia Amidon Lüsted in the,The Mooring Mast. Al Smith, the architect of the Empire State Building, didn't want his masterpiece to be only for show, so he gave it purpose; a dock for dirigibles. By adding a comma ""thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether,"" the buildings frame would be under much stress; ultimately making the structure unsafe. To alter the frame and wind pressure, over @MONEY1 would need to be accumulated. If an accident were to take place, like in Lakehurst, New Jersey, the densely populated city would be in grave danger.

"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. For example, ""A thousand foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the buildings frame."" The builders could not simply ""drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof."" The builders now had to find a way to add this mooring mast for dirigibles without putting too much pressure on the building. In addition, ""The steel frame of the Empire State building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation."" They now had to add ""over sixty thousand dollars"" worth of modifications to the building. In conclusion, ""Architects designed a shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel tower that would be illuminated from the inside, with a step-back design that imitated the overall shape of the building itself."" @CAPS1 the architects went through much work not only to make the mooring mast for dirigibles successful, but beautiful.

"The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in their attempts to allow dirigibles to dock there. The builders ""main obstacle were the wind currents the dirigibles had to face in trying to dock nearly eleven hundred feet in the air. The harsh winds at the top of the building were constantly changing because of the air currents. The U.S. Navy dirigible Los Angeles could not even get close enough to tie up to the mast. ""The captain could not even take his hands off the control levers"" (Lüsted @NUM1) in fear the outer shell would be punctured by the mast. Additionally, if a dirigible was tied to the mast, it would moving all around the mast based on the unpredictable air currents. However, safety was also a major factor. ""Most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable"" (Lüsted @NUM2). Therefore, attempting to tie dirigibles to the mast of the Empire State Building was very unsafe, as the obstacles the builders faced were simply too much to overcome..Consider me gone..Field Commander Cohen, he was our most important spy..Black Metal!.Das EFX in this ya know what I'm sayin'   Straight from the sewer word is bond!.Chorus x2   Where them girls at..Over here, to the rear with your girl and the   40s of beer      Where you At Rock?.He came to town like a midwinter storm   He rode through the fields so   Handsome and strong   His eyes was his tools and his smile was his gun   But all he had come for was having some fun      If it hadn't been for cotton-eye Joe   I'd been married long time ago   Where did you come from?.All I Need Is Your Love And Your Care..It's a long, long highway   Will this road of life lead me to someone   Who sees the world in a grain of sand   Who holds the future in the palm of their hand, aaah      No one else can see things like I do   It's a long, long highway   Looking for a home where the seed was sown   And the harvest was young      Will this road of life lead me to someone, someone   The rays of sun and the light of dawn   My inspriation since the day I was born, aaah   No one else can see things like I do      It's a long, long highway   But don't make the start on an empty heart   When you think you've begun   Let the road of life lead you to someone, someone      Nothing is serious to me   I live for what will be (listen to me)   I can always be a dreamer   So trust your heart      Don't fall apart   You'll see   At your journey's end   You will find a friend in me      It's a long, long highway   Will this road of life lead me to someone   You touched the dream that was in your eyes   You took so long only to realize oooh      No one else can love you like I do   It's a long, long highway   Looking for a home where the seed was sown   And my harvest was young      Will this road of life lead me to someone   It's a long, long highway   But don't make a start   On an empty heart      It's a long, long highway   Let this road of life lead you to someone, someone"
"In The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, two architects play ""battleship"" with each of their dirigibles, competing for most height. However, when building these ""enormously steel-framed balloons"", the architects didn't realize the obstacles that they would have to face during this process. The biggest reason was for safety precautions. Since most dirigibles were made of hydrogen, they were highly flammable. This, they said, could have been worse than the German Hindenburg, which was demolished by fire in New Jersey in 1937. However, the best obstacle to use of the mast was nature. The winds caused the mast's to be clanging above human beings, which was not practical or safe..Walk me over this horizon   Let the sun's light warm my face   Once again the times are changin'   Once again I lost my way   Well the words of ancient poets   Fall like dust upon my shoes   Greed has robbed me of my vision   Turned my heart from higher truths   So take my hand and lift me higher   Be my love and my desire   Hold me safe and honor bound   Take my heart to higher ground   I have walked too long in darkness   I have walked too long alone   Blindly clutching fists of diamonds   That I found were only stones   I would trade the world of ages   For a warmer hand to hold   The path of light is narrow   But it leads to streets of gold   So take my hand and lift me higher   Be my love and my desire   Hold me safe and honor bound   Take my heart to higher ground   In this world we move through shadows   Never sure of what we see   While the truth that lies between us   Come and share the truth with me   So take my hand and lift me higher   Be my love and my desire   Hold me safe and honor bound   Take my heart to higher higher ground   Hmm hmm hmm hmm.Would you hit me?.:]   I remember the winters in the hood, no heat cold nights   No gas no lights, a ghetto low life   So my flow twice as strong, from the memories   I remember when my closest homies, turned to enemies   See niggaz tend to be, down when your bread up   But when you in the quicksand, they frown cause your legs stuck   Yeah I remember that, so you remember this   Hard times be my fuel, so I ain't finna quit   I vividly, R-E-M-E-M-B-E-R   Craig up in the E-R, bloody getting CPR   So before, the reaper come and turn me to a memory   I endlessly spit the heat, for the people to remember me   Me P.O.P., so many forgot bout   But not I, this for those who remember little Popeye   And I remember hot guys, ridiculed the flow   Now I'm front and center nigga, haters finna do me so      [Hook x2]      [Bun B:]   Shit I remember back in the game, it was tough   No matter what a nigga had, it was never enough   See if I had five I wanted ten, and if I had ten I wanted twenty   Fuck having some, shit I wanted plenty   Back in the gap, when I first hit the block   With my first 25, and a hand full of rocks   Posted up at Samantha house on the West, on the porch   Ready to give my nigga some work, or give him the torch   I remember telling my T, I wasn't going to college   And was headed to the streets, to get the rest of my knowledge   That broke her heart, and for that I had to go   So I went from the sidelines, to starring in the show   Everything came slow, and nothing came fast   Most times I was out of luck, and dead on my ass   But with the heart of a hustler, and the mind of a G   I came up, now I'm something to see Bun B      [Hook x2].Uncle Sam and Pentagon they couldn't do what he has done      Gorbachev he had no laughs when Mr. Rust signed autographs..And for thirty silver pieces..Oh darling, it's gonna be late when we get back home   Can you wait till we get back home?.See a little man with his face turning red   Though his story's often told you can tell he's dead..I need you now, do you love me still?.Yes, have you ever loved a woman, so much you tremble in pain?"
" The emire state building faced alot of obstacles and challenges while it was being built. The builders built a rocket shaped mast so the dirigible could be housed in the shaft itself.

"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles. There were two main ones: Safety and Nature.The builders should have realized that the idea wasn't safe, before building. Most dirigibles from other countries use hydrogen instead of helium, which was highly flammable. An accident over densely populated New York would be bad.The biggest obstacle was nature. There were violent air currents that caused constantly shifting winds at the top of the building. This would cause the back of the ship to swivel around the mooring mast.There was also an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This means it would be illegal to tie a dirigible up to the building, anyway..I'll hold out my hand and my heart will be in it..Wo Wo Wo..Running in the wrong direction   Isn't it a long way home,   People with the wrong intentions   Isn't it a long way home..Tell me I'm anything but fine..Please crawl out your window   Use your arms and legs it won't ruin you   How can you say he will haunt you   You can go back to him any time you want to..But if I kiss you will your mouth read this truth,   Darling how I miss you, strawberries taste how lips do,   And it's not complete yet, mustn't get our feet wet,   'Cause that leads to regret, diving in too soon,   And I'll owe it all to you, oh, my little bird,   My little bird..Whatever's wrong son, he told me he'd make right..A little trick with dick   dick Dick bo bick   Banana fana for fick   Fe fi mo mick   dick!.Born is the King of Israel."
"The builders of the Empire State building faced many problems when tempting to let dirigbles dock there. There were @NUM1 major problems of why it was so hard to dock them at the Empire State building. These obstacles were what was in the dirigbles, the ""nature"" of winds around New York, and a new law passed on restrictions of airships.     Dirigbles unlike balloons, which are made up of Helium, dirigbles are made up of hydrogen. Hydrogen is highly flamible. This coud have resulted in terrible way if anything caught on fire since New York is so highly densed.     Another problem they faced were the high winds of New York. They were constantly shifting, so they thought to tie the dirigibles down with lead but this would be a bad idea because if the lead ever fell it would injure many people.     Lastly, they recently passed a law against airships flying too low over urban cities. If this law was very strict than the dirigibles wouldnt be allowed to dock there because it might be too close to the city.     In, conclusion there were many obstacles that the archtects dont think about before constructing..Ooh babe   Because nothing loves you like I do..You know it   You show it   And the time has come   To shoot you down   What a sound   When the day is done   And it all works out      I'd love to do it and you know you've always had it coming      You know it   You show it   And the time has come   To shoot you down   What a sound   When the day is done   And it all works out      I'd love to do it and you know you've always had it coming      I never wanted   The love that you showed me   It started to choke me   And how I wish I'd said   No too slow   I couldn't take   That too fast   I want you to know      You know it   You show it   But I can't back down   It's far too late   I can't wait   Now the time has come   It'll all work out   And when this   Thing is done   It'll leave no doubt   So when you've   Had your fun   Will you all walk out ?.Oh tequila, I turn to you like a long lost friend   I want to kiss my Mexican cousin once again   We'll cover every emotion from happiness to sorrow   And the conversations I forget you'll tell me about tomorrow   When the phone calls start, am I in bed or in a hearse?.For Now does ride in on the curl of the wave,   And you will dance with me in the sunlit pools..How many times do I have to tell you, darlin',   I'm still in love with you now?.Sacrifice to vice or die by the hand of the curse   And damn you all you fall by the hand of the sinner!.Sometimes I'm afraid when you go....Plese remember to mention me,   In tapes you might leave behind..I'm giving, giving, giving love and smiling at the frowns (me too!)"

"The early @DATE1's was a time where everyone was out to find and build the next best thing. In @CAPS1, two tycoons were competing to build the tallest building in the world. Al Smith, the man creating the Empire State building, had an idea to make his building taller and more popular; build a mooring mast for dirigibles on the top of his building. Though a good and creative idea, the obstacles his architects would face would turn out to be more than they bargained for.first off, putting a mooring mast on top of the Empire State building was very unpractible without changing the whole design."" The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and Strengthened to accommodate this new situation"", (@CAPS2 @NUM1). Also, the dirigible would put so much stress on the foundation of the building. ""The Stress of the dirigible's load and wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the buildings foundation...,"" (@CAPS2 @NUM1). Nature was also a giant obsitacl these architects faced while building this.

"There were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced when trying to allow dirigibles to land there. One is that the weight of the zeppelin, when tied down to the building, would put immense pressure on the framework and the pressure even would have reached the foundation. The cost of reworking the frame work to make it safer would have been @MONEY1. Another obstacle was public expectations. The Building was supposed to change how we travel forever, all while being a beautiful, magnificent structure. Surely the pressure to build the tallest tower in the world got to them. These expectations were so unreal because most people didn't know enough to understand the safety risk involved..She looks like the real thing..Hot summer night..Big Jim      I mean, biggest thing you ever did done see?.[Valjean goes in, leaving Eponine alone.].(Verse)   Hey, beating yourself up   Tryna figure up how you wound up out in the cold   Not only did you lose me, but the one that you was   Cheatin' on me also left ya alone, no, I can't speak for her   But that be mean(?).I'm falling apart, no good on my own      Oh l'amour   Broke my heart and now I'm aching for you   Mon amour   What's a boy in love supposed to do?.There's a bus every other hour,   There's even the midnight train..What's the matter with your life   Did someone come and shoot your with wife   Just as you planned   Will you live or will you die   Are you that butterfly   That never lands   Set aside these vacant rules   Break them now and don't get fooled again      Sorry   How many times must I say   Life is not a cake to separate   What do I have to do   To save you from worry   Cut off my nose   To spite my face      When you look into these eyes   Do you see civilized   Or son of Sam   Will you love or do you hate   Why do you hesitate yeah      Sorry   How many times must I say   Life is not a cake to separate   What do I have to do   To save you from worry   Cut off my nose   To spite my face      Time is an arrow   You are the bow   Shoot it now to seal your own fate   Get a life, get a love, get a new big idea      What's the matter with your life   Did someone come and shoot your with wife   Just as you planned   Will you live or will you die   Are you that butterfly      Sorry   How many times must I say   Life is not a cake to separate   What do I have to do   To save you from worry   Cut off my nose   To spite my face.Baby, don't go, I love you so."
"The Empire State Building at the time it was being built was designed to be the tallest building in the world. However this was not an easy task. The workers had one especially difficult obstacle overcome, @CAPS1 dirigibles, or blimps, to dock there. The plan was to build a mooring mast on top of the building which would allow dirigibles to dock. If this could be achieved it was said to make the Empire State Building, ""equipped for an age of transportation..."" However many problems occurred. The dirigibles weight would have to be able to be held safely. The architects knew the weight would put stress on the buildings frame. The workers had to modify and strengthen the buildings framework. The workers also built the mast out of a strong, shiny, chrome-nickel. Another obstacle was faced when the mast was taken in consideration. The framework was originally stopped at the eighty-fifth floor. The workers had to finish the roof before the mast could be framed. Although the workers succeeded on making a safe mast, the ""Aviation Pioneers Dream"" never came to be..Lets switch and let me do you instead(cuz girl I love it)   Though I love the way you give it to me   Girl, we'll be bouncing like the springs on the bed(you)   You gone love it when I give you some (ha ha ha ha ha)(oh)   Switch and let you do me instead   Cuz I love it when you give it to me      Verse:   Do it to me I'll return the favor   Baby we can do it now or later   It's up to you..I'm dreaming of a white Christmas   Just like the ones I used to know   Where the treetops glisten,   And children listen   To hear sleigh bells in the snow      I'm dreaming of a white Christmas   With every Christmas card I write   May your days be merry and bright   And may all your Christmases be white      I'm dreaming of a white Christmas   With every Christmas card I write   May your days be merry and bright   And may all your Christmases be white.It's the sound of letting go..Now, he's underneath that apple suckling tree   Oh yeah!.Youth, beautiful youth   We walked through the walls until we found the truth   And said ""Change it, it's ugly just change it""   Everyone we used to know   Must have given up, so long ago   You can see it, it's written on their faces   And the inside of their clothes      But the words that made me cry   'Cause I knew just what they meant   He turned to me and said   ""Hey boy, if Jesus Christ is alive and well   Then how come John and Elvis are dead?"".As I look over this place   There's so much hatred   If I could I'd pack my bags   And hitch hike to heaven      Spirit move   Oh move   Spirit move   All through the land   Won't you move   Oh move, oh move, oh move   Oh move, yeah   This is what I prayer for      (Peace) for peace   (Peace) all around the world   (Peace) woah   (Peace) I prayer for peace   (Peace) oh peace   (Peace) oh peace   (Peace) heaven shine your light      (Shine your light on me)   (Shine your light on me) let it shine   (Shine your light on me) oh   (Shine your light on me) shine your light   (Shine your light on me) on me   (Shine your light on me) for the World   (Shine your light on me) to see (pray for me...)

"The Empire State Building face a lot of obstacles like in paragraph @NUM1, ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame."" This was one of the many trouble there was for dirigibles to land on the Empire State building. In paragraph @NUM2, They @CAPS1 to realize that the mooring mast of the @ORGANIZATION1n't of been build, because it wouldn't work."" The Mooring mast of the Empire State Building was destined to never fulfil it's purpose, for reason that should have been apperent before it was ever constructed. The reason that mooring mast was because of nature. As you will see on paragraph @NUM3, ""the Wind were shifting due to violent air currents."" The mooring mast had a lot of problems scinc the beginning when Al Smith put a top to the building making it 1,250. It was unsafe for planes. When they wanted to make the Dirigibles land on top of the building. Dirigibles that came from another countries had hydrogen, which is highly flammable. The problem that worked anginst the mooring mast being buit was wind on top of the building @CAPS2. Because of the air currents. These are the reasons why the mooring mast was unsuccessful on the Empire State Building.Coming in with the golden light   With no warning..You keep on talkin' to me   'Till your face turns blue   Well do you think I'm a young boy   Yet to make up my mind?.I[Chorus]   I'm comin' up,   So you better get this party started..It's only just a stage   Give it room, start an empty page   Get back in the game, do it your way   You don't have to play so heavy   Turnin' around   It's pressin' me down   Heavy heart   This time I find   It weighs on my mind   Heavy heart   When your heart is strong   It leads you on   But when it breaks you   It devastates you for so long   Turnin' around   It's pressin' me down   Heavy heart   This time I find   It weighs on my mind   Heavy heart   Turnin' around   It's pressin' me down   Heavy heart   This time I find   It weighs on my mind   Heavy heart.we will not be lovers, no   We will not be lovers, no.Will you meet me in the hall?.I'm ready for lonely fun times, yeah   Loud music may dull my mind   Black coffee and electric sunshine   Get set for this pantomime..You might not see him in person but he'll see you just the same..Sometimes I'm so forgiving   Everything seems bad to me   But I can't go on living   With this alibi, alibi, alibi...

"From my reading, I understand that the difficulties of building a mooring dock atop such a structure as the Empire state building were numerous. an obvious one was structural stability throughout the entire building. Paraphrased from the passage, the tension from the dirigible pulling on the tether would cause stress on the building's frame. another was controll of the dirigible during docking. The passage explained that the winds above the empire state building would shift violently and frequently. Safety as well as an issue, especially after the Hindenburg accident in New Jersey, when a German zeplin caught fire and exploded. .Did you ever love me, or were you playing with me before?.Trying so desperately to be free   Come with me dance, my dear   Winter's so cold this year   And you are so warm   My wintertime love to be   La, la, la, la   Come with me dance, my dear   Winter's so cold this year   You are so warm   My wintertime love to be.!.You know I'm gon' get ya, yeah   Whatever it takes to get there   No, I won't drop you   Like everybody else does      Forget about your friends they don't care where we go   If they do, we'll get lost in a crowd of people   I've been looking for you forever baby we go   Together baby we go, we go      In this crazy world of choices I've only got a few   Either you're coming with me, or I'm coming with you   'Cause I finally found, I finally found you   You never have to worry if what I say is true   Girl, I've been looking for you   And when I saw you I knew, that I finally found,   I finally found you      I'm coming I'll get ya, yeah   We have a connection, that's right   'Cause girl I'm not letting go   I'm gonna make you feel right, oh yea      Forget about your friends they don't care where we go   If they do, we'll get lost in a crowd of people   I've been looking for you forever baby we go   Together baby we go, we go      In this crazy world of choices I've only got a few   Either you're coming with me, or I'm coming with you   'Cause I finally found, I finally found you   You never have to worry if what I say is true   Girl, I've been looking for you   And when I saw you I knew that I finally found,   I finally found you      I finally found, I finally found you      Okay, so can I get love, too much to ask for   Really so tough   Find yourself moving with sex of the drums   Got my hands full, grabbin' all these girls, girls   Hands up, hands up, dance floor chillin' while I hold two cups   Can't stop spilling, 'cause I'm drunk as fuck   And my song comes on, and the club goes nuts   Every time the side goes, seems to ya sleep, best that to ya know   Running around, and doing all these shows   Round the whole globe, I come, and you go girl   And you need to think of it   Just wrap for the night, baby live a bit   With a place to hit, and your pants to zip   You can make a scene and party, are you into it      In this crazy world of choices I've only got a few   Either you're coming with me, or I'm coming with you   'Cause I finally found, I finally found you      Finally finally finally found you   Finally finally finally found   Finally found, I finally found you      You know I'm gonna get yeah.Aimless lady..Oh, please tell me this..We filled his head with cannonballs and powdered his behind,   And when we touched the powder off, the gator lost his mind..I may have no money   But I know where to put it every time      Well, I asked a young policeman   If he'd only lock me up for the night   Well, I've had pigs in the farmyard   Some of them, some of them, they're alright   Well, he fucked me with his truncheon   And his helmet was way too tight      [Chorus]      I'm a lonesome schoolboy in your town   I'm a lonesome schoolboy.You just look at them and nod your head now wink say ""Whadd'ya At?"""
"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many @CAPS2 in trying to allow dirigibles to dock there. The builders had a real hard time with this construction of the morning mast. They had to deal with the frame work of the building. A big obstacle they had was that they didn't have a suitable landing area for the dirigibles. They didn't just have to deal with man made @CAPS2, but nature's @CAPS2 as well. The wind on the top of the building made it nearly impassible to land safely. ""The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation"" (@CAPS1 @NUM1). The constructors of the building realized that to make this plan possible they would have to redo the frame of the building. The building wasn't even designed to be able to allow dirigibles to land on the top of the building. The workers were blind to see all the possible problems with the design of the moorning mast. The @CAPS2 the workers had to go through were to much and the landing of the dirigibles never worked..Worst part about fighting with yourself   Is that even if you win, you loose   Can't place the blame on everybody else   So I'm fighting with myself over you      I should have played it different but I didn't know   I never pictured you without me or you letting go   I should have seen it coming   I should have thought it through   The best part of me has always been you   And no apology can bring you back to me   Feels like I'm suffocating, you are the air I'm breathing out   I'm so down and can't move and I'm beating me up over you      The worst part about fighting with yourself   Is that even if you win, you lose, yeah   Can't place the blame on everybody else   So I'm fighting with myself over you   Maybe it's better making you feel you were crazy   Instead of just being the man to fight it   And can't blame, you knew that I was cheating   And I knew that you knew   But when you call me on it   I just turned around on you   Begging you don't let go   ...

"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. A problem they faced was having to build the mooring mast because without it the derigible would add stress to the building's Frame. In paragraph @NUM1 it says ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the buildings Frame."" Even though the builders made the mooring mass it was to unsafe to moore dirigibles from the building. ""The greatest reason was one of safety: Most dirigibles From outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is very flammable.""

"In the excerpt, The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, the Empire State Building faced some obstacles while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. To begin with, one of the greatest obstacle was the act of nature. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"", this made it hard for the dirigible to have a safer landing. The other obstacle was that there was a law, that went against airships flying low over urban areas. In conclusion, the mooring mast of the Empire State Building was not use for landing airship such as the dirigible because it was to dangireous. In addition, they used the mooring mast for other safe purpuses..(Come on, Frenchie)   THE POODLE CHEWS IT!.As I looked into my crystal ball....[Repeat: x3]   We never get.She's been forever faithful, hones and true,   Yes she was!.With just a sleeping bag and an old guitar   I left the band in New Orleans   I did some time with the bottle, some with the river queens   I never thought I would meet a girl   Who could turn my head around   Till I met that Mississippi Lady in sleepy Gulfport town, she was a      [Chorus]   Mississippi Lady   My lovin' Gulfport gal   She taught me how to love   And she really loved me well   She took me up to heaven   Then she brought me down   That Mississippi Lady, Sweet Cordelia Brown      Hot July in Gulfport   And I was working in the bars   And she was working on the street   With the rest of the evening stars   She said, I never met a guy   Who could turn my head around   And that's really sayin' something   For Sweet Cordelia Brown      She was a      [Chorus]      Now I'm back in New York City   Playin' in a band   But my mind's on Mississippi   Is it hard to understand   I never thought I would meet a girl   Who could bring me that far down   Like the girl I met in Gulfport   Sweet Cordelia Brown      She was a      [Chorus]      That Mississippi lady, Sweet Cordelia Brown.(Would you like me to seduce you?).Did you say you wanna dance with me?.Youre gonna find, yes you will,   That youre beautiful as you feel....

"In the beginning the use of dirigibles seemed like a good idea. They could be the new form of transportation and appeared to have no flaws. As the development of dirigibles progressed it showed signs of problems. The engineers planned on mooring the dirigible to the mast of the Empire State Building, but that would have added a lot of stress to the building's frame. They next found that safety was an issue. Most dirigibles used hydrogen instead of helium which was flamable. Also they would have to use lead weights to hold down the dirigible when it was being moored. It would be very dangerous to have lead weights dangling over pedestrians on the street. With out the lead weights the dirigible would simply swivel in the air with a possibility of puncturing its shell. Finally there was a law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This made it illegal for the ship to even approach the building. There was high hopes for the use of dirigibles, but in the end they had more cons then pros..(hold it..At this time we do not know where or why the people are   Running but there seems to be an organized plan directing there action..Never have I spent a day without you on my mind..[Pre-Chorus: Jesy]   We used to never go to bed angry   But it's all we ever do lately   And you're turning away like you hate me   Do you hate me, do you hate me?.Now the girl let the fat man touch her   Vodka fumes and the feel of a vulture   The driver waited in the embassy car   The fat man's trap was set for capture   So the girl let the thin man touch her   Mixing questions, drunken laughter   The ministry car was waiting there   A minister knows his own affair      The people must have something good to read on a Sunday.Just when I think it can't get worse, I had a shit day (no!).Greensleeves was my heart of gold   And who but my lady Greensleeves ?.Lovers depend on moonlight for a love affair   Babies depend on mothers for their tender care   Flowers depend on sunshine and the morning dew   Each thing depends on something and I depend on you      I can be happy, I can be sad   I can be good or I can be bad, it all depends on you   I can be lonely out in a crowd   I can be humble, I can be proud, it all depends on you      I can save money or spend it, go right on living or end it   You're to blame, honey, for what I do   I know that I can be beggar, I can be queen   I can be almost any old thing, it all depends on you      I can be happy, I can be sad   I can be good or I can be bad, it all depends on you   I can be lonely out in a crowd   I can be humble, I can be proud, it all depends on you      I can save money or spend it, go right on living or end it   You're to blame, honey, for what I do   I know that I can be beggar, I can be queen   I can be almost any old thing, it all depends on you.Lovely."
"The Empire State building is known as the worlds tallest building. The building is located in New York. Al Smith the head of building the Empire State building, added a top or a hat to the building, that made the building be even more distinctive than any other building in the city. The Empire State building was equipped for transportation. The transportation was dirigible, or zeppelin. The Empire State building had a mooring mast at its top for docking the new airships. An obstacle that the Building faced was New York's lack of a suitable landing area. Al seen an opportunity to get people to and from the Empire state building. Al seen it as something creative and new. The mooring mast of the Empire State Building was never fulfilled. No thought of safety was thought about before constructing the idea either. The greatest reason was most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium which is a higher @CAPS1 for flames.

"While builders tried to figure out a way for dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building, there were some obstacles faced. If a dirigible was held by a single cable, this would add stress to the building's frame. The dirigible would have to be cabled at the top which was also difficult because of the Empire State's flat roof. Also weather was a huge obstacle. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" (@CAPS1 @NUM1, line @NUM2) The wind would cause the dirigible to sway and not be very stable. Builders had to also keep in mind that using the building could be harmful to pedestrians as well, the dirigibles would be too close to the ground.

"During the process of building the Empire State Building, the builders had to go through obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on it. Some of these obstacles were changing the design of the building, thinking about the safety of people, and the material the dirigibles were made of. Since a thousand-foot dirigible that moored at the top of the building would add stress to the building's frame, the steel frame of the building would have to be modified and strengthened. Over sixty thousand dollars work of modifications had to be spent. A dirigible was a steel framed  balloon with envelopes of cotton fabric filled with hydrogen and helium. This was a safety issue; Most dirigibles used hydrogen, rather than helium, and hydrogen is very flammable. A German dirigible was destroyed by fire, and the owners of the Empire State Building realzed how bad an accident like that could be over downtown New York. During construction of the Empire State Building, builders had to go through many obstacles just to attempt to allow dirigible to dock there..Santa baby, slip a sable under the tree, For me..Puts him at the wheel..And you might be one baby when we meet again and I'll still try to make you mine..When will they ever learn?.These are the days of thunder and rage,   We cry our battle hail....You're everything I need   Cause I want what you're giving   I'm yours to do with what you please   N.A.S.T.Y..Early morning without warning   Woke me with a scare   I had that dream again   That the sun was dead   Make me warm or take me home   It's so cold in here   Can't we meet somewhere   Is it winter there?.I don't wanna hurt ya, I just wanna know ya   Read me your script later baby I'll call ya,   Body so sick gotta get next to ya   I've been waitin' all night long to know you're name   I don't wanna hurt ya,   I just wanna know ya   Read me your script later baby I'll call ya,   Body so sick gotta get next to ya   I've been waitin' all night long to know you're name   Everything about you girl I want   And you gotta know that   I don't wanna hurt ya   I just wanna know ya   Read me your script later baby I'll call ya      Most don't get   All of that brain and the face is so flawless   She's such a beautiful girl   And every fantasy at night I dream about is all in you   If I try   Would you take me where you are   That place that many won't ever get a chance to see   You've been so cold   (been so cold)   Maybe, (baby)   If you let me   Your flame   (your flame)   Will be on again   Tell me what you want   (come tell me what you want)   'cause I won't sleep   I won't cheat   Love me   Its all that you give      [Chorus]   I don't wanna hurt ya   I just wanna know ya   Read me your script later baby I'll call ya   Body so sick gotta get next to ya   I've been waitin all night long to know you're name   I don't wanna hurt ya   I just wanna know ya   Read me your script later baby I'll call ya   Body so sick gotta get next to ya   I've been waitin' all night long to know you're name      I've been thinking bout the way   That I'm gonna take it down   Ain't no way that you would bein need   'Cause you'd be all I'm thinking bout   Ain't no way      [Chorus]      Know your name   To know your name   I don't wanna hurt ya   I just wanna know ya   Read me your script later baby I'll call ya      Tell me what I gotta do   I mean      I don't wanna hurt ya   I just wanna know ya   Read me your script later baby I'll call ya      I got the list right here   'Cause it's exclusive now      I don't wanna hurt ya   I just wanna know ya   Read me your script later baby I'll call ya      I'ma put you on it alright?.I thought I knew the score,   But now youve treated me so wrong."
"There were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Some minor obstacles were the frame and strength of the building. Other obstacles were major such as nature which cannot be controlled. In paragraph nine the author explains that if a thousand-foot dirigibles were to be moored to the top of the Empire State Building it would add stress to the building's frame. Also with wind pressure the building's foundation would be affected. In order to allow dirigibles to dock, the frame of the building would have to be modified and strengthened. As nature as a great affect on the use of the mooring mast it would be almost impossible for dirigibles to be tethered onto the building. The wind would send the dirigibles swiveling around the mooring mast as the author describes in paragraph fourteen.      Other obstacles the builders faced were most dirigibles from outside the U.S used hydrogen rather than helium, most landing fields weighed down the back of the blimps would lead weight (which wouldn't be safe to have dangling over pedestrians), the last problem was there was an existing law againts airships flying low over urban areas.                Though the builders of the Empire State building faced obstacles in allowing blimps to dock it still became a well known building in @LOCATION1..All I say is thank you to my mother,   To my father, my brothers and sisters      To be in my dream, to be not full of sorrow   And we call you to be in this way      All I say is....We climbed a little too high,   A little too fast,   And we can't come down..Nobody knows..And as word of the gold shipment spread,   Strangers suddenly appeared in jungle village      Ay yo, ay yo, Machete still stainless   The archbishop run from the Knox   A Chris biscuit plus play the heart, wrists glisten   Goon captain, catch me in Africa black down with 4 5 Somalians   Black Tims, rubber suit Wonder Woman, bangers a blue coupe   I'm usually upon the roof countin' mad loot   Root beer reefer, teeth frame, doin' my 1, 2   Smokin' with a plain Jane trooper   Excellent with rifles, out in Japan   In a flight goons switchblade poke out the night boots ?.Carry me through tomorrow, guide me along the way..Open up, open up, baby let me in..I can't fight love,   I can't fight love..Lamplights glows on old guitars the travellers strum,   Incense children dance to an Indian drum..Little johnny hooker, he ain't a bad looker, he ain't a bad man, he ain't."
"When the architects behind the mooring Mast of the Empire State Building first began there work in designing it, they did not take into account the @CAPS1 that they would have to overcome to dock a dirigible. In the excerpt it States that the mooring mast was not originally part of the design structure for the Empire State Building: however the stresses it would cause in docking a dirigible ""would have to be transmitted all the way to the buildings foundation."" This means that the builders would need to design Some way of doing this when the building was already begun. Other @CAPS1 included those of safety. The exerpt tells that ""most dirigibles from outside the U.S. used hydrogen"" which is more flammable than helium. This combined with the fact that there really was no way of securing the tale of a dirigible moored at the mast could cause an accident @CAPS2 to that of the Hindenburg over a ""densely populated area Such as downtown New York"".'Cause each day brings another confusion,   It's about to break this poor heart of mine,   Ohha, gonna lose my only mind, oh baby..They say the beat of a butterflie's wings   Can set off a storm in the world away   What if that ride in the smallest of things   Can power the strongest hurricane?.Or should I close the door?.Want you to be of good cheer   Come back home on the Celtic New Year      Celtic New Year, Celtic New Year   Celtic New Year   In the Celtic New Year   In the Celtic New Year      Come on home, come on home, come on home, come on home   In the Celtic New Year.Though you try you can't conceal it   Love has only brought us storms   I can see your eyes revealin'   Your a stranger in my arms   Say goodbye to our romancing   We have lost the flame that warms   Though I hold you while we're dancing   Your a stranger in my arms   Every story has an ending   This is where our story ends   Please don't hurt me by pretending   For lovers never can be friends   Through the years your love will haunt me   And I'll dream about your charms   Still I know you'll never want me   Your a stranger in my arms   Every story has an ending   This is where our story ends   Please don't hurt me by pretending   For lovers never can be friends   Through the years your love will haunt me   And I'll dream about your charms   Still I know you'll never want me   Your a stranger in my arms.It ain't Coca-Cola it's rice..I'm your toy, I'm your old boy   But I don't want no one but you to love me   Oh I wouldn't lie   You know I'm not that kind of guy      Once upon a time   You let me feel you deep inside   And nobody knew, nobody saw   Do you remember the way you cried?.Follow my heart..How ya doing?"
"Builders of the Empire State building faced numerous obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. A mooring mast, for docking drigibles, would add stress to the buildings frame and ""could not simply be dropped atop the Empire State Building. The building needed to be ""modified and strengthened"" to accommodate this situation. Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen, which is extremely flamable. Owners of the building realized if an accident like the Hindenburg were to take place above a densely populated city or area such as downtown New York, results would have been far worst. Builders greatest obstacle would be nature itself. Winds atop the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the air ship could tether to the mast, the back of the ship would swivel around the mooring mast. In addition, due to an existing law against airships flying too low, dirigibles could not legally moor at the Empire State Building. ""The mooring mast of the Empire State Building was destined to never fulfill its purpose."".Cause everybody expects YOU to make their day   And they're all be on to you if you're in a bad mood..I'm lost, I'm a ghost   Dispossessed, taken host   My hunger burns a bullet hole   A spectre of my mortal soul   These rumors and suspicion   Anger is a poison   The only truth that I could see   Is when you put your lips to me   Futures tricked by the past   Spectre, how he laughs      Fear puts a spell on us   Always second-guessing love   My hunger burns a bullet hole   A spectre of my mortal soul   The only truth that I can see   Spectre has come for me.Can't get close enough to you, 'cause you're just too far away..Is it really the end?.Tonight, I want to get high..Green mansions, high upon a hill   Green mansions, quiet and still   Big wall all around   It's where my baby will be found   Waiting for that day, to come      Green mansions, high upon a hill   In the countryside where the birds begin to sing   Free from the glamor of the world   Where the story does unfurl   Waiting on that day to come      Tried in vain to forget   Just how it ought to be   Over and over and over and over again   'Bout what it means to me      Green mansions, I can hear the mocking bird   Birds singing in a melancholy wood   The big wall all around   Where my baby will be found   Waiting for that day to come      Well I've tried in vain, to forget   Yeah what it ought to be   Over and over, over again   Just what it means to me      Green mansions, high upon a hill   Green mansions, quiet and still   Big wall all around   Where my baby will be found   Waiting for that day to come      Green mansions, high upon a hill   Green mansions, quiet and still   Big wall all around   Where my baby will be found   Waiting for that day to come..A shoulder to cry on, get high or die on maybe?.Eating grapes under the A.C.

"In the excerpt, ""the mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, the builders of the empire State building faced some obsticles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obsticle was that in order to build it for docking dirigibles, they had to spend over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the buildings framework. Also, another obsticle was because of the safety. Dirigibles were not that safe, they were flameable and would be over an area with many other buildings and people around. Those are a few obsticles that the builders of the empire State building faced in attempting to allow the docking of dirigibles..Standing in your kitchen      It's late enough   Your husband's dinner is cold   So you wrap it up and leave it for him on the stove   It's probably the traffic again      Another important meeting   You haven't talked to an adult all day   Except for your neighbor who drives you crazy   When he finally gets in   He's sure not in the mood for talkin'      I was stealing kisses from a boy   Now I'm begging affection from a man   In my house dress   Don't you know who I am?.Every place I go I think of you,   every song I sing, I sing for you..How bad do you want it?.Holding onto all You brought me though,   You're the strength that I'll always cling to!.I reached for you but you were gone,   So lady I'm going too..You lied and you lied   And I died and I died   And now you know why      Five, four, three, two, one   Bang bang bang boy   Your goin' down down down boy   To the ground where you left my heart to bleed..I can't believe it's me,   I can't believe it's you,   I can't believe it's both of us   Not knowing what to do   When we're running out of love..Thinking 'bout your loving, 'bout your loving, sweet, sweet      [Verse 2]   Come back sugey, come back to me   Fix me up a mixed drink, Bacardi   I'll put on your favourite dress and we'll party   Take a drive, kiss, kiss by the sea   [Pre-Chorus]   You don't have to say   That I'm the girl that got away      [Chorus]   I been drinking Jack and Coke a lot   Sucking on my lollipops   Listening to my hard rock mu-mu-mu-music   Thinking 'bout you quite a lot   Smoking all my cigarettes   Missing what we used to got   You-you-you kid      [Post-Chorus]   Won't you come home to me now babe?.It's plain to see it's hopeless,   Goin' on the way we are."
"In the excerpt, The Mooring Mast by, Marcia Amidon Lüsted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigible to dock there. One of these obstacles being stress. Yes, stress. This is because when you have a thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the Empire State building, only by which is held by a single cable tether, it adds stress to the frame of the building. Another obstacle the builders faced was safety. Seeing as most dirigibles have been known to use hydrogen rather than helium, you would think hydrogen is the one to go with. Unfortunately, hydrogen is a fire caution because it is extremely flamable. So safety was definitely another obstacle in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the top of the empire state building. A final obstacle the builders faced was nature itself. This is simply because the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast, on repeat because violent currents would constantly shifting the winds on the top of the building. There would be no solution, even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast. These are the obstacles the builders of the Empire State building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there, in the informative excerpt, The Mooring Mast by, Marcia Amidon Lüsted..(Beyonce)   My niggers is home, I guess I got everything   Everything I want, but I don't   Know matter how good it gets it will never be like before   No women in the crowd, screaming and it's loud   Doing things not allowed   And I swear it's going down right now   I know one thing my momma would be proud   And you see me looking up   Cus I know she's looking down right now      (Charlie Wilson - Chorus)   I know you see me now right now,      (I know you see me now right now)   I know you see me now right now (Right now, right now)   I know you see me now right now (Right now)   I know you see me now right now      (Kanye - Verse 2)   Poor the champagne let your watch show   Shortie got a man watch, wrist look colossal   I admit my first watch was a fossil   Now I'm in the louvre looking for fossils   Attention to detail is so uncanny   And the whips on this?.Then the band starts to syncopate,   You jump from thirty three to seventy eight..So give me the chance   To renew our romance   For this time I know it will stay   Oh yes, this time I know it will stay.So lets pack it up and take it somewhere special...

"There were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the mooring mast. One obstacle they faced was the lack of a suitable landing area. They would have to design a mast for the dirigibles. Another obstacle was the dirigibles was held by a single cable tether and that would add stress to the building's frame. Next, New York City would have to spend over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework. Then the greatest reason of safety came upon them. That was, most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium. And hydrogen is highly flammable. On @DATE1 a German dirigible ""Hindenburg"" was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey. The owners of the Empire state building realized if that happened to New York and how big of a problem that would cause. The final and greatest obstacle they faced to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself. From all the violent wind and air currents would be hard to tether the dirigibles to the mast. In conclusion, those were the obstacles the builders of the Empire state Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to land there..Say yeah, yeah, yeah..Make it sing it's song   Make it fight   Make it fight, fight!.I love her so bad, but she treats me like shit   On lock down like a penitentiary   She spreads her loving' all over and when she comes home   There's none left for me..Now gather up sea shells   And write down brave words   Your prayers are unanswered   Your idols absurd   The seaweed and the cobweb   Have rotted your sword   Your barricades broken   Your enemies Lord.I.O.I.I.I.I.I.O.I.O..I had just turned sixteen that season   When you came up from Burma to stay..And when he's strong,   He's strong for you..walk on TV.It's a very special Christmas,   A blessing from above,   It's baby's first Christmas,   A Christmas full of love!"
"There were several major obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One such problem was that, ""the stress of the dirigibles load and the wind pressure would have been transmitted all the way to the building's foundation..."". It cost over @MONEY1 to make the modifications nesescary to do this. Also, the, ""roof had to be completed before the framing of the mooring mast could take place."" @CAPS1, they did not solve several other obstacles. Forein dirigibles normally ""used hydrogen rather than helium..."" And this would cause vast damage if they crashed in ""a densely populated area such as downtown New York."" In addition, being so high, the dirigible could not be weighted down in the back and thus would swivll around the mast. There was also a law prohibiting ""airships flying too low over urban areas. In the end there were too many obstacles so the dirigible docking plan was scrapped..Turn on your receiver, I'm gonna lay it on the line   'Cause I'm a great believer, in hangin' on to what is mine   So come over here and listen, I don't want you to be missin'   What I say   And I ain't gonna waste my time sayin' it all again      I've been hearin' stories, 'fact the word's all over town   I've had my share of worries ever since you've been around   So come over hear and listen, I don't want you to be missin'   What I say   And I ain't gonna waste my time sayin' it all again      Turn on your receiver, there's a message comin' through   Keep your hands off my woman   Keep your hands to yourself   Keep your hands off my woman.At last the crimson chord cascade   To shower dry cordials within   Too late to leap the chocolate gate   Pale fountains fizzing forth pink gin   While destiny begins to fly   The farmyard chorus sings its wake   Upstanding anthem to the sky   Too soon to realise their fate   You were the raven of October   I knew the sign you flew around   Up in the air so high above me   Never needed to look down   I never thought I'd be a rover   I didn't even look around   But now I know you've found another   So will someone please find me   Give now the host his claret cup   And watch Madeira's farewell drink   Note his reaction acid sharp   Should make the cognoscenti think.Each time that I hold you close, here in my arms   I'm building heartaches   Each time that I kiss your lips, so sweet and warm   I'm building heartaches      And when you say you love me   We both know it's a lie   An' just a dream from which I must awake      That each sweet word you tell me   Is a heartache in disguise   So I'm building heartaches      When people ask me what I'm doin', here's what I tell   I'm building heartaches   And each kiss you give me is a tear that hasn't fell   So I'm building heartaches      And when you say you love me   We both know it's a lie   An' just a dream from which I must awake      And each sweet word you tell me   Is a heartache in disguise   So I'm building heartaches.Gimme, gimme, gimme some lovin' (good lovin')   Hey, now you got to have lovin' (good lovin')   You need it, I need it, well you got to have lovin' (good lovin')   Say it again now, good lovin'..Flo talked slow   Like real wet paint   She said, ?A middle man's there   When the other ones ain't   He's got a left handed manner   That leans to the right, sleeps all day   And keeps it up all night?.No matter where i go, you're always there,   No matter where i look, I feel your stare,   I thought it was forgotten, or at least forgiven,   You're gonna keep punishing me till the day i leave him..The wait is ova!.Alone..Save me."
"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock thousands of feet above the New York streets. One of their many problems was the sheer size of the dirigibles, somewhere as long as one-thousand feet. Another problem they faced was keeping the back of the ship from swiveling around the mooring mast. Usually, the backs of these blimp-like structure's were anchored down by lead weights, but to have lead weights dangling high above the streets was way to risky not to mention unpractical..We could be immor-immortals, immor-immortals,   Immor-immortals, immor-immortals..One Way, Jesus, You're the only one that I could live for..Oh      Oh yeah!.Terror filled their minds with awe..One life is like one prayer, one love to share..You can look (look), but don't touch, no!.Her eyes well up with tears   God could it be it's been ten years   Since that Autumn night outside the county fair   When two strangers shared a night   And in the darkness found a light   That to this day is still alive and burning there..I work my fingers to the bone   Just trying to keep up with the Jones   You call me on the telephone   Say baby hurry hurry home      Pour me a little splash of red   You look like you could raise the dead   Have you got something on your mind   Come on girl we're wasting time      (Chorus)   Just let your body do the talking   Don't let the words get in the way   Yeah I can tell the way you're walking   That you got nothing left to say      Ain't gonna watch the evening news   Cause I don't care who's shooting who   You're putting on my favorite shoes   About to do that thing you do      Ah let's do it all night long   Cause in the morning I'll be gone   If everything works out all right   Same place, same time tomorrow night      [Chorus]      Ain't got nothin' to say      [Chorus]      Yeah I can tell the way you're walking   That you got nothing left to say   Nothin' baby.Drop it."
"The builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous problems dealing with the mooring mast. First of all, I would say safety was the number one issue. If the dirigible were to catch on fire, it could land on the main streets of New York City, posing a hazard to hundreds of pedestrians. Also, the weather was another factor. If it were too windy to fly all the time, then the mast would be a waste. When I read that they had to spend <@NUM1</@CAPS1> to modify the building's framework,""  I started thinking of all the other things a town could do with @MONEY1. There was also an existing law that made it illegal for any airships to be even remotely close to the Empire State Building.

"In the excerpt, The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon Lüsted some obstacles the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there are the winds were too strong and most used hydrogen instead of helium which is very flammable. The way that the dirigibles would dock to the building was by a cord attached to the mast. The dirigibles would then be ""dangling high above pedestrians in the street."" (@NUM1). This was ""neither practical nor safe"" (@NUM1) This would not only endanger the pedestrians below but also the people on the dirigibles. The wind was so strong that it could throw it into a building. Most dirigibles fuel on hydrogen rather than helium, hydrogen is much more flammable.

"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in the attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. The first problem, according to the excerpt, is that ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the frame."" They would need to spend over @MONEY1 in order to modify the building's framework. Another issue, ofcourse, was the safety of the mast. Most of the zeppelins from places besides the U.S., did not use helium. Instead, those limbs used hydrogen which is highly flamable and would have caused disaster if ignited above a densely populated area such as downtown New York. The excerpt also states that, ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself. The winds on top of the building constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" @CAPS1, there was already a law in place preventing airships from flying too low over urban areas, There fore, it would be illegal for a blimp to attach to or even go near the Empire State Building. For the reasons stated, builders were not able to build a mooring mast a top the Empire State Building..All day long I hear my telephone ring   Friends calling giving their advice   From the boy I love, I should break away   'Cause heartaches he'll bring one day      I lost him once through friends advice   But it's not gonna happen twice   'Cause all advice is ever gotten me   Was many long and sleepless nights      Oh, but now he's back in my arms again   Right by my side   I got him back in my arms again   So satisfied      It's easy for friends to say let him go   But I'm the one who needs him so   It's his love that makes me strong   Without him I can't go on      This time I'll life my life at ease   Being happy lovin' whom I please   And each time we make romance   I'll be thankful for a second chance      Oh, 'cause he's back in my arms again   Right by my side   I got him back in my arms again   So satisfied      How can Mary tell me what to do   When she lost her love so true?.Who did what?.Where the fuck is he?.(hey, hey)      Put on your hi-heel sneakers,   Put your wig hat on your head..Are you lonesome tonight,   Do you miss me tonight?.wannabe, all he ever wants is)   Isn't it fun fun fun to be number one   Isn't it fun fun fun yeah to be number one   (He's a V.I.P..Will the world remember you   When you fall?.When the world slips you a Geoffrey   Stroke the furry wall   Stroke the furry wall      Furry walls don't bring me down   Furry walls please stay around   Furry walls   Furry walls      Furry walls kiss me to sleep   Furry walls please help me weep   Furry walls   Furry walls      Furry walls can take you on a magic carpet ride   Furry walls surround you till you got no place to hide   Let your furry fingers be your guide      Furry walls turn out the light   Furry walls please stay the night   Furry walls   Furry walls      Furry walls says have a taste   Furry walls sit on my face   Furry walls   Furry walls      Maybe I'm in heaven with the furry skies above   All around the furry clouds, look, here's a furry dove   Let me stroke your furry walls of love      Furry walls   Furry walls      Furry walls I am amazed   Furry walls we're in a daze   Furry walls   Furry walls      Don't be in a hurry, things are not the way they were   Shaggy walls of loveliness, it's all a furry blur   Maybe I'm in heaven with the furry skies above   All around the furry clouds, look, here's a furry dove   Let the walls caress you in a showering of love      Furry walls   Furry walls      Furry walls I'm gonna cry   Furry walls please let me hide      Furry walls   Furry walls      Furry walls   Furry wa-alls   Furry walls.Leave me no time   In your imagination."
"The builders of the Empire state building faced many problems in trying to allow dirigibles to dock at the top @CAPS1 ""The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof."" @CAPS2 the designers had to find a way for the dirigible to dock at the top of the building. Even if they did find a way for it to dock though, ""a thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame.""

"There were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One example is that by adding the dirigible, it would add stress to the building. The frame of the Empire State Building would have to be changed due to the pressure that would be put on the building. All of the changes that would have to be made would add up to over sixty thousand dollars. Now, there would also be 102 floors. The top floor would be the boarding area as well as an observation area. One more thing they had done for the mooring masts was raise an American flag on top. All of these accommodations were made for the help of dirigibles docking on top of the Empire State building..All your shame, oh, oh, oh..I'm very lucky I think you'll agree      I've lost the key to my front door   I can't get in there anymore, oh my   I've lost the key to my loves heart   Its down the drain and in the dark, oh my      I'm very lucky I think you'll agree      As I was riding home from work   I saw a robber steal a shirt, oh my   I shouted oi!.Our hearts now pull in new directions   We don't know how to say goodbye      Something's gone wrong with us   Something ain't right   Why are we lonely in the night   Why are we lonely in the night      Something's gone wrong with us   Something ain't right   Why are we lonely in the night   Why are we lonely in the night.I've looked at it every way I can   From under and above   And every chance i've had   My love went mad   Love went mad love went mad   You you feel like I feel?.The heart never forgets,   No the heart never forgets..Scar tissue that I wish you saw   Sarcastic Mister know it all   Close your eyes and I'll kiss you cause'   With the bird I'll share   With the bird I'll share   This lonely view   With the bird I'll share   This lonely view      Push me up against the wall   Young Kentucky girl in a push-up bra   Fallin' all over myself   To lick your heart and taste your health 'cause   With the bird I'll share, this lonely view      Blood loss in a bathroom stall   Southern girl with a scarlet drawl   Wave goodbye to ma and pa 'cause   With the bird I'll share   With the bird I'll share, this lonely view      Soft spoken with a broken jaw   Step outside but not to brawl   Autumn's sweet we call it fall   I'll make it to the moon if I have to crawl   With the bird I'll share, this lonely view      Scar tissue that I wish you saw   Sarcastic Mister know it all   Close your eyes and I'll kiss you cause'   With the bird I'll share   With the bird I'll share, this lonely view.Together, together, wherever, wherever   Together, wherever we go!.[Verse 1]   Baby you smell good   Cause they warned me bout your type girl   I've been ducking left and right   Baby you're no good   Think I fell for you, I fell for you, I fell for you      [Pre-Chorus]   You got me puttin' time in, time in   Nobody got me feeling this way   You probably think I'm lying, lying   I'm used to bitches comin' right 'way      [Chorus]   You got me touchin' on your body   You got me touchin' on your body   To say that we're in love is dangerous   But girl I'm so glad we're acquainted   I get you touchin' on your body   I get you touchin' on your body   I know I'd rather be complacent   But girl I'm so glad we're acquainted      [Verse 2]   Baby you're no good   All my niggas think I'm crazy cause I'm thinkin' 'bout us lately   But really if I could   I'd forget about you, 'get about you, 'get about you      [Pre-Chorus]   You got me puttin' time in, time in   Nobody got me feeling this way   You probably think I'm lying, lying   I'm used to bitches comin' right 'way      [Chorus]   You got me touchin' on your body   You got me touchin' on your body   To say that we're in love is dangerous   But girl I'm so glad we're acquainted   I got you touchin' on your body   I got you touchin' on your body   I know I'd rather be complacent   But girl I'm so glad we're acquainted, we're acquainted      [Verse 3]   Momma called me cryin', cryin', cryin', cryin'   I won't find somebody that's real (she wants somebody that's real)   Cause every time I try to, try to, try to run   The fast life keeps gaining on me, shit   But ever since I met you   I couldn't believe what you did   So comfort me babe, ain't no rush from me babe      [Chorus]   I'll keep on touchin' on your body   I'll keep on touchin' on your body   To say that we're in love is dangerous   But girl I'm so glad we're acquainted   I got you touchin' on your body   I got you touchin' on your body   I know I'd rather be complacent   But girl I'm so glad we're acquainted, we're acquainted      [Outro]   I'm not trying to talk at all   Cause I'm trying to love you crazy   Put some more inside your cup   And drink till you numb the pain   I got you touchin' on your body   These girls keep touchin' on their body   They got accustomed to the life we live   These girls born in the '90s are dangerous   I got 'em thinkin' that they want me   Although they know they not the only   I got 'em wanting to embrace their sins   These girls born in the '90s are dangerous.Knock on wood,   Is it understood that I'm saving it up for you."
"The designers of the Empire State Building faced many challenges in the attempt to allow dirigibles to dock on it's peak. ""The greatest reason was safety"" (para @NUM1). The dirigibles were dangerous. Strong winds could blow them in different directions, possibly hitting the building. And if there was a crash, the debris would rain upon New York City. Since there was wind, they would have to use lead weights to hold a dirigible in place. However above the city this would be ""neither practical nor safe"" (para @NUM2). Finally, there was a law prohibiting airships from flying low over urban areas. This would cause the docking to be illegal. For these reasons, the builders of the Empire State building faced challenges allowing blimps, or dirigibles, to dock on the building..Might've fired off a couple of rounds, I didn't mean to begin it..Could it be that he's interested   Or should I let the moment go and      Forget this hunger inside   Forget this hunger inside   Should I let the feelin' flow   Should I just let it flow   Ain't nothin' but a maybe ?..Choking chicks and sodomy!.Love for sale..Though they have changed forever   I'm still in love with you      Moments, do you remember moments?.[Chorus:]      Last night as I lay on my pillow,   Last night as I lay on my bed,   Last night as I lay on my pillow,   I dreamed that my Bonnie was dead..There's a hole in my bed where I ain't seen you for days   Got a pain in my head ''cause I'm back to my bad old ways   I can't get out, you won't come in   And you can't see the state I'm in   On top of it all, my A string's gone again      Everyday I'm a-wasting away, it's oh so bad   My mind's gone dead and my eyes are red, it's oh so sad   Nobody calls, they've had enough   I've got to stop myself drinking this stuff   On top of it all, my A string's gone again      Oh no, oh no, man overboard you know, and I'm gonna drown   Oh no, oh no, I'm wrecking myself and I'm running around      Save my soul, I said save my soul   Oh save my soul, I'm losing my grip   I think I'm gonna slip, oh      I gotta do something or I might as well be living in hell   I gotta find someone who can break me away from this spell   It's getting to me, it's bringing me down   I'm cold and I'm lonely since you ain't around   And on top of it all, my A string's gone again      Oh no, oh no, man overboard you know, and I'm gonna drown   Oh no, oh no, I'm wrecking myself and I'm running around      Save my soul, save my soul   Save my soul, I'm losing my grip   I think I'm gonna slip, oh.O free the world from blindness   And fill the world with kindness   Give sinners resurrection   Bring striving to perfection..Huh?"
"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. An example would be from the excerpt when the author writes in paragraph 6 ""The one obstacle to their expanded use in New York City was the lack of suitable landing area."" This quote means the builders were faced with the challenge of space to land the dirigibles because New York City was a relatively crowded area. Another example would be in paragraph @NUM1, when the author tells about the safety hazards. Many dirigibles used hydrogen insted of helium, which is extremely flammable. A last example would be in paragraph @NUM2 when the author describes the safety hazards. The builders had to consider the violent winds on the top of the building. Many obstacles came upon the builders..I get a little bit bigger but then I'll admit   I'm just the same as I was   Now don't you understand   I'm never changing who I am      It's time to begin, isn't it?.You charge them a ""fiver"", It's only for starters..I didn't know if I would live or die..Be near me, Lord Jesus,   I ask Thee to stay   Close by me forever   And love me I pray      Bless all the dear children   In Thy tender care   And take us to heaven   To live with Thee there.T.G.I.F..Once there was a way,   To get back homeward..You got to realize this is the wind-up,   You'll feel much better once you made your mind up..(x2)      Congratulations you have won   It's a years subscription of bad puns..She was a day tripper,   Sunday driver, yeah."

"Based on ""The Mooring Mast"" there were several obstacles the builders faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. First of all, they couldn't just put a mast a top the building because it would put too much pressure on the building's frame. Also the stress would be transmitted all the way to the foundation of the building, which was 11 hundred feet below the mast. So before they could build anything, they had to re-inforce the entire structure of the empire state building. Finally these obstacles were fixed, but those were the obstacles the builders fixed..No..I've been searching   For a pot of gold   Like the kind you find   At the end of the rainbow      I've been dreaming   Thought it was in vain   Ah, But now you're here   Can't believe that you're back again      Now I know I can't lose   As long as you follow   I'm gonna win   I'm gonna beg, steal, or borrow   As Long as you follow      I've been wandering   Gone away too far   But the road was rough   To get back where you are      And the sun went down   Never seem to rise   Ah, but now you're here   With the light shining in your eyes      Now I know I can't lose   As long as you follow   I'm gonna win   I'm gonna beg, steal, or borrow      Yes, I can live today   If you give me tomorrow   As long as you follow      Now I know I can't lose   As long as you follow   I'm gonna win   I'm gonna beg, steal, or borrow      Yes, I can live today   If you give me tomorrow   As long as you follow.Ca pe o fantoma reala din ultima vara      Ultima privire mi-a ramas in amintire   Ca un vis,ca o poveste disparuta in nori      In noapte sau zi te voi gasi   Te voi iubi amara mea...te vois gasi.Jump up,   Oooo   Jump up..[Verse:]   Whatever it takes, whatever Your will Lord   Whatever Your purpose for me I'll do   It's not about me, it's not about my will   It's all about living my life for You   You desire more of me, I desire You   Lord, Your love has set me free   I will live for You      [Chorus:]   Every chance I get, I will praise You   Oh, praise Your name   Every day I will live to glorify   Every chance I get      [Tag]   All I want Lord, all I'm living for, is to know You more   Every chance I get      [Ending]   Every chance I get.Ha-ha!.You have never changed your ways   You think that you can own me like a slave   And I want to walk away   But every time I try you're in my face   You say, I could have it all   Trust you, you will never let me fall   And my heart feels bound to your control   But my spirit says, no, no, no      [Chorus]   Stop right there   Suddenly temptation's flying   Everywhere   And you think you've got me down   Well think again, I'm not your friend   It's plain to see, I'm not your property   Stop right there   Suddenly temptation's flying   Everywhere   And you think you've got me down   Well think again, I'm not your friend   Don't play with me, I'm not your property      Ring!.They put the finger on you,   Finger gang..I've got love songs in my head   That are killing us away""      ""Do you love your guns?"""

"The obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow the dirigibles to dock were very difficult. difficult. One difficulty that they had was that the mooring mast nature it self. When the dirigibles would come to the building, the winds on the top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air current, and the only way that they could moor is if the weighted down the back, and using them at the Empire State Building won't be practical or safe, with pedestrians below you.Another obstacle that the builders had was an existing law. the law was against airships flying to low over urban areas. This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building, or even approach the area. this was an obstacle because they didn't have much to do about this since it's a government thing holding them back.These are just some obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow the dirigibles to dock..O gather up the brokenness   And bring it to me now

"The Empire State building faced hardships while trying to dock their dirigibles. The builders tried to build a docking station for the dirigibles, but the only problem they had was safely docking in thousands of feet in the air. The one obstacle to their expanded use in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area. Winds in New York would also make it difficult to land. Another reason why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building was the laws about airships flying too low over urban areas. Not only was it illegal, but also unsafe. Most dirigibles from out of the United States were made with a highly flammable gas called hydrogen. A German dirigible was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey. The owners of the Empire State building relized how bad it could've been in a highly populated area such as New York..And there's many a cowboy who don't understand the way that he feels for his brother..Creating a life only to destroy   Saved from a life of the unemployed   Where crime is the only way to survive   Which is the best to be dead or alive?.I'm gonna take my books   I'm gonna wear my coat   I'm gonna find my scarf   And wrap it around my throat   And you can   Come with me   Through the drivin' snow   We're gonna ride on up to   Medicine Bow   Well I spent too long   Just stuck on the shore   There's a man in my head   But he isn't me any more   I'm gonna find me a ship   Stowaway on a boat   I'm gonna burn all the words   And letters and cards that I ever wrote   And you can   Sail with me   Where the current flows   We're gonna move on up to   Medicine Bow   I'm gonna change my colors   Cancel my things   Stop my squawkin'   Grow some wings!.They say love is cruel, they say love is rather fragile   But I've found in You a love of another kind   They say love brings hurt I say love brings healing   Understanding first it's a love of another kind   The love I know is a love so few discover   They need to know Jesus' love is like no other   They save love won't last I say love is never ending   'Cause in You I have a love of another kind   They would change their tune they would add another measure   If they only knew this love of another kind   The love I know is a love so few discover   They need to know Jesus' love is like no other   They say love is cruel, they say love is rather fragile   But I've found in You a love of another kind   They say love brings hurt I say love brings healing   Understanding first it's a love of another kind   They save love won't last I say love is never ending   'Cause in You I have a love of another kind   They would change their tune they would add another measure   If they only knew this love of another kind   Love of another kind   The love of another kind   The love of another kind   The love of another, the love of another kind   Give me love this is love   (This is love)   Another kind, another kind of love   This is love   (This is love)   You need another kind of love   Another kind, another kind of love   Another kind of love   This is love   (Give me love)   Another kind, another kind of love.Your captivating eyes   The clever way they smile stops him in his tracks   And add your pretty face you keep him in his place   He'd do anything you ask      They've broken the mold   More precious than gold   When you're standing there the world disappears      It would be a crime to ever let you go   He should be inclined to keep you very close   No one else compares   You're a cut above the rest   He'd be such a fool if he should ever leave you      Be careful what you do he?s so in love with you, you might tear him apart   To watch the way you move, it?s obvious that you were made for breaking hearts   The pout of your lips, those soft fingertips   The curve of your waist, you?re perfectly made      [Repeat: x3]   It would be a crime to ever let you go   He should be inclined to keep you very close   No one else compares you?re a cut above the rest   He'd be such a fool if he should ever leave you      Your captivating eyes   The subtle way you smile sets him in a spin   The subtle way you smile.The air was strong but Jane she was much bigger   Aaaaahhhh   Then she heard me   Say that oath that   Made everything clear   I love you   My ocean blue   I like the way your sea sees me   My darling Jane   Oh me, my darling Jane   Oh me and my darling Jane   She speaks to me at times through falling rain   Speaks to me at times through falling rain.I miss the smell of ink on paper and it's morning pull   All the news comes via link now all so virtual   I don't know what to think   I don't know what to feel   The beginning of the end or reinvention of the wheel      And for all we've left undone   We are still evolution      I want to feed and water the horses,   The course is long and dry   Can't do it alone oh no we can't although we've tried and tried and tried   We may not deserve you, we'll come to serve you by and by   Feed and water the horses   Where they lie..This warehouse frightens me..Did I say that?"
"The builders of the Empire State Building encountered obstacles in trying to allow dirigibles to dock at the mooring mast on top of the building. The main problem was perhaps that foreign dirigibles don't use helium, they use hydrogen. Using hydrogen was a huge problem because hydrogen is extremely flammable. If a problem did occur, hypothetically, that a dirigible caught fire it would cause a threat to New York City which is highly populated. If the dirigible blew up the people of New York would not have enough time to get away from the blast. Another problem was winds. Winds can easily blow the dirigible off its course of worse into a spire on top of a building and puncture it. This problem was discovered when the U.S navy dirigible ""Los Angeles"" Was attempting to reach the mooring mast. The captain couldn't get anywhere near the mast. These obstacles and dangers suggest the mooring mast is a bad idea.

"The builders faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building. They had to find a way to keep the dirigibles from spining around the top of the tower. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" This meant the dirigibles, would swivel around the mast unless tied down. The next problem or obstacle was making the buildings structure strong enough to withstand the tension caused by the dirigibles. ""Over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications had to be made to the buildings framework. The next challenge was to create a safe enviroment for the pedestrians below. That was not possible because the city was already made below. The drigibles ""would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street was neither practical nor safe.

""A thousand-foot dirgible moored at the top of the building held by a single cable tether, without strees to the building's frame."" At times when they try to add things that made the building only heavyer and more likely to fall. They try to add more things to only make it look better but what they didn't know is that it was only gain to fall more..(what a am I doing now?).I found love, darling,   Love in the nick of time      I found love, baby,   Love in the nick of time..And he said ""FLY ON""   fly on because I'm A voodoo chile, baby   Voodoo chile, hey      Yeah!.Another main line ride   Oh no!.Hey little girl with the red dress on   There's a party tonight down in...

"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lüsted shares some of the obstacles that were dealt with when trying to make it possible for blimps to land atop the Empire State Building. Lüsted discusses the obstacles of nature, safety, laws, and construction in ""The Mooring Mast"". Nature presented a huge setback in terms of docking dirigibles. As Lüsted writes, ""even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast"". The safety of docking blimps on the Empire State Building also became issue. ""The owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse ""an accident could be if it happened above downtown New York, instead of in a field. The laws in affect of the time made it illegal for airships to fly too low over urban areas. This law makes docking a dirigible impossible in New York City. The construction alone of accommodating a mooring mast required ""over @NUM1 dollars worth of modifications"" and a lot of time and planning. As Lüsted says, ""The mooring mast of The Empire State Building was destined to never fufill its purpose"". The obstacles presented in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building were too great and too many. The laws, safety, construction, and nature of the time were too big a setback for this endeavor..You're lookin' at me   Nowhere to go   What they're sayin'   I just don't know   A floor below me   Ceiling above   And I'm in the middle   With nobody to love   Nobody to love   Nobody to love   Nobody to love   Yeah   Well lookin' at me   Nowhere to go   Know what they're sayin'   I just [don't know?].I get deep,   I get deep,   I get deep,   I get deeper   When people start to disappear,   It is about six o'clock,wooo, I'm feelin hot,   Take off my sweater and my pants,   And i start to dance,   And all the sweat just goes down my bass?....They don't look real to me,   In fact, they look so strange..Oh, it has to be for you to grow , boy..(we came across the country lickety-split)   (Rollin' ninety miles an hour)   I can't believe I'm here at last   Woo-oo-ooo!.If you tell me what to do   I could do it quite well   Give detailed desires, I'd be tryin' like hell   You could leave a little clue   I would follow it through   You got to say somethin'   If there's anything you want me to do      Let me be the slave you can faithfully flog   Let me be your dog      I got no way a'knowin' what show is in town   I could be your pacifier   I could be your favorite hound   Just gimme some proof, I'll deliver in style   On a hot tin roof, I'll be burnin' the tiles      Let me be the friend of a friend   Of a stepmother's brother   Of the slave you can faithfully flog   Let me be your dog      Roll me right over, I'll crawl and I'll beg   Casanova rover, bitin' your leg   Cause what goes around, comes around   Simple as that   You'd be doin' yourself a favor   Cuttin' the crap      Let me be your cross-breed, off the lead   Chasin' my tail   I could make you feel better   Like a check in the mail   Like a poll-position for the closin' down sale   Like a hog in a synagogue   Let me be your dog      Call me Rover   Let me be your dog   C'mon baby, I'll be good   Like I know I could   Let me be your dog   Hey baby, please baby   Let me be your dog.Proclaim Your awesome power   Tell of mighty deeds   Declare Your future kingdom   Of everlasting peace      And my eyes they look unto You always   And I am captured by Your Majesty      All of my days   I will sing of Your greatness   All of my days   I will speak of Your grace   All of my days   I will tell of Your wonderous love   Your love in my life   Your love      All Your works will praise You   Your children bless Your name   We speak of all Your goodness   We walk in fields of grace.Chorus:   Jesus, you are my best friend,   And you will always be,   And nothing will ever change that,   Jesus, you are my best friend,   And you will always be,   And nothing will ever change that."
"There are a few obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building face in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle would be the building of the mooring mast to be added to the top of the building. Although it was a good idea, it was very complicated. Another Reason consists of law @CAPS1. There was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. New York is defanitley not the City for this idea just because there is alot of people walking around the @CAPS2 and there is many buildings around. This idea of docking dirigibles on the Empire State Building would @CAPS3 to be over with the invention of airplanes. The idea @CAPS4 disappeared..Turn it up   This is it!.With the residue stuck deep down in your teeth   When you smoking with the dogg, shit, you might not eat!.Old Danny can carry us both, jump up behind me..Whose to say,   That you were right,   And I was wrong,   Soldier on..Goodbye!.Give it all I got   Call me in the morning, when I'm half asleep   Rivers runnin high on the mountain deep      Call me deadly, call me deadly serious   And Ill say yeah!.Treading the waves,   Come in from harm..For you alone, I'd conquer world   I'd do most anything for you alone   For you alone, I'd give everything   I'd say the sweetest thing for you alone..[Verse 1]   All the holes at once are coming alive, set free   Out of sight and out of mind, lonely   And their prey      [Chorus]   The ones you light your fires to keep away   Crawling out upon, expending   And all you have to do is say yeah      [Verse 2]   All the birds stay up in the trees   All the fish swim down too deep and lonely   And they pray   Honey, come to me before it's too late      [Chorus]   The ones you light your fires to keep away   Is crawling out upon, expelling   And all you have to do is say yeah"
" Al Smith's idea of making the Empire State Building bigger was a very difficult task. Also tying to make the top of the building a docking area for new airships was difficult. One obstacles the builders faced attempting to create a dock for dirigibles was preventing stress to the buildings frame. If the builders wanted to fix that it will invole the the building's foundation which was eleven hundred feet below. The framework of the building will cost too much money. The stress of the building will come from the dirigibles's load and wind pressure. Another Obstacle that the builders were faced with was the wind. The violent air current would cause the building to constinously shift. They didnt wand to use lead weights because it was to dangerous. because they were dangling high over predestrains. A law that builders had to think about while building this was the law that went against airships flying too low They had many obstacles that the builders had to keep in mind while building the dock..Take the chance   Now's all we got for sure!.If you leave me now, you'll take away the biggest part of me   Ooohh no   Baby please don't go   And if you leave me now, you'll take away the very heart of me   Ooohh no   Baby please don't go   Ooohh girl   I just want you to stay      A love like ours is love that's hard to find   How could we let it slip away   We've come too far to leave it all behind   How could we end it all this way   When tomorrow comes and we'll both regret   The things we said today      A love like ours is love that's hard to find   How could we let it slip away   We've come too far to leave it all behind   How could we end it all this way   When tomorrow comes and we'll both regret   The things we said today      If you leave me now, you'll take away the biggest part of me   Ooohh no   Baby please don't go   Ooohh girl   I just got to have you by my side   Ooohh no   Baby please don't go   Ooohh mama   I just got to have your loving here.Matter where I serve my guests,   They seem to like the kitchen best cause I'm the cook of the house..Let the good times roll..Seether is neither big nor small..And I am held by every silver strand of love you spin..Written by lindsey buckingham      Don't know why I have to work   Don't know why I can't play   Turn me off turn me out   But don't turn me away   Save me a place   I'll come running if you love me today   Don't know why I have to go   Don't know why I can't stay   Guess I want to be alone   And I guess I need to be amazed   Save me a place   I'll come running if you love me today   I'll come running if you love me today..I'm the one, I'm the one, I'm the one, I'm the one   I'm the one-man army, Ason   I've never been tooken out, I keep MCs lookin' out   I drop science like girls be droppin' babies   Enough to make a nigga go crazy      And energy buildin', takin' all types of medicines   Your ass thought you were better than Ason   I keep planets in orbit   While I be comin' with teeth, bitin' more shit   Enough to make you break and shake yo' ass   'Cause I create rhymes good as a tasty cake mix      This style, I'm mastered in   Niggas catchin' headaches, what, what?.You fly out your lady, I fly out my ladies   Bitches can't front on the kid anymore, man they know what my name is   And if by chance she don't know who I am, she just know that I'm famous   Imma just hand her a business card and say ""Nigga we made it!"""
"Builders faced many problems with @CAPS1 dirigibles to dock on the empire state building. The first problem they faced was the wind at the top of the building. When the Navy dirigible Los Angeles tried to dock at the building, the wind wouldn't allow it to get close enough without moving out of control like hitting another building. This made it impossible for the dirigible to dock and so the Los Angeles gave up. Another reason builders faced a problem with with @CAPS1 dirigibles to dock on the empire state building, was that there was a law that said airships were not @CAPS2 to fly low over urban areas. This law would prevent any and all dirigibles from coming near the building and therefore they wouldn't be able to dock..Is it enough for me   Or will I want more?.As he tries to face his feelings, he can't justify his crimes,   Now comes the final ending, of the dreams he once held sacred deep inside..This is my love for you..Never in all of my life   Have I seen eyes as empty as these streets of my city   On a Saturday night,   All the green of your eyes says ""Go, leave it all behind."".Rain on me, I'm not complaining   I'm soaking from my hat down to my shoes   Rain on me 'cause I'm believing   Love is something I get to lose   What do you know about love?.Ah yes, of course, yes, yes, it was a lack of applause   Scrap metal for a fantastic bird   Fantastic bird      Science propels you, science still engulfs you   But science will never love you like I do      'Cause when you land all you do I hear is my voice   Hello, welcome I love you, don't you see?.She's sweet and tender, but I remember   The girl I once knew, made me feel so blue   She loves me madly, I treat her badly   'Cause girl, it should be you, it should be you   It should be you, it should be you....(Every day of your life.).In the car park   In the lamplight   Go for a walk   Clock him shiv-fight   Sodium-a-shine on   All the faces white now   And he got his Docs on   Bottle out all right now      As you might say   Him super-tuff      In the corner   In the cold rain   Sting like iodine   In my brain   Fist you til you fall down   Hit him back make him mad   Really hard."
"The Empire State Building wanted to allow dirigibles to dock on top. To do this the would need to build a mast on top so that the dirigibles could hook on to and refuel. They ran into a lot of problem right off the bat and kept running into them. The first problem, of many, was that they could not just plop a mast on the top because it would be to unstable and cause to much stress to the structure. To prevent that what they ended up doing was modifying and strengthening the structure as a whole costing over sixty thousand dollars. Once they figured out how to equal out all of the wind pressure, they had to think of how to bring the dirigibles in, the answer was simple electrical winches. The next problem was safty, dirigibles outside of the @LOCATION1 used highly flammable hydrogen and if that blew up it would not be good for the densely populated city below. Another safety issue was nature's violently shifting winds and to solve the problem on the ground they would waive the back down with lead weights to keep it from sweying, but doing that in the air over a lot of people could be unsafe. The final nail in the coffin to this plan was that there is a law for bidding airships to fly too low over urban areas..The sun will shine on you again, a bell will ring inside your head - and all will be brand new..You can't believe a word      It's how you see the world   Don't you worry yourself   'Cause nobody can learn      Oh   Oh   Oh      That's how you see the world   That's how you see the world.I want you to want me..MY MARIE   WRITERS BARRY MASON, TONY MACAULAY   Marie   I can't bear to see the children without bread   Oh Marie   They deserve a decent roof above their heads   Trust me now   And when I leave for town, my darling, don't be sad   Or ask me how   But tomorrow, we're have all the things we never had   But if I'm not back there with you   By the time the sun goes down   Take the train, change your name   And get the children out of town   Yes, if I'm not back there with you   By the time the sun has gone   Forget me, my Marie   And move on   Marie   Ah, you've never had a new dress you could wear   Oh Marie   You look so pretty with a ribbon in your hair   For too long   You've gone without the life that I once promised you   Right or wrong   But today I'll find a way to make it all come true   But if I'm not back there with you   By the time the sun goes down   Take the train, change your name   And get the children out of town   Yes, if I'm not back there with you   By the time the sun has gone   Forget me, my Marie   And move on   Forget me, my Marie   And move on.My eyes long to see you..Looking at money man,   Diggin' the deadly quotas,   Out of balance,   Out of hand   We want the land!.Last train to London, just headin' out,   Last train to London, just leavin' town..Tried   We feed upon the broken branch   We kiss the stars goodbye   For the sun can't fight this overcast   I tried, I tried, I tried   I...Look out!"
"In attempt to make the Empire State Building higher than the Chrysler Building, the builders ran through a few obstacles trying to allow dirigibles to dock there.One obstacle was because of safety reasons. Dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen, not helium. Hydrogen was more flammable, causing the builders to realize if an accident like when the German dirigible was destroyed by a fire in New Jersey it would be more worse if it was to happen in a populated area such as downtown New York. Known as one of the greatest obstacles attempting to use the mooring mast was through nature. If the dirigible was tethered to the mooring mast, the back of it would move around and around due to the winds on top of the building.The practical obstacle the builders faced was by law. An existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. Having to tie up the dirigible to the building would be illegal. But as years passed on the idea of using the mooring mast died out leaving there to be no more obstacles to face..Style of your hair   Shape of your eyes and your nose   The way you stare,   As if you see, right through to my soul      Its your left hand and the way   That its not quite as big as your right   The way you stand in the mirror,   Before we go out at night      A quiet time, your beautiful mind,   They're a part of the list   Things that I miss,   Things like your, funny little laugh   Or the way you smile or the way we kiss      What I noticed is this,   I come up with   Something new, every single time   That I sit an reminisce      The way you sweet smell   Lingers when you leave a room (you leave a room)   Stories you tell as we lay   In bed all afternoon (all afternoon)      I dreamed you now every night   In my mind is where we meet (in my mind is where we meet)   And when I'm awake   Staring at pictures of you asleep      And touching your face, invading your space   They're a part of the list   Things that I miss,   Things like your, funny little laugh   Or the way you smile or the way we kiss      What I noticed is this   I come up with   Something new, every single time   That I sit an reminisce      And you'll live in my   Memories, forever more I swear      And you'll live in my   Memories, forever more I swear      They're a part of the list   Things that I miss   Things like your, funny little laugh   The way you smile or the way we kiss      What I noticed is this   I come up with   Something new, every single time   That I sit an reminisce.I thought I saw him on the video   A trance is keeping him under   I know that god is in the radio   Checkin' the station   I'm glad I caught it from me to you   Just a call in the medium   I know you hear it, I hear it too   It's everywhere that I go      You come back another day   And do no wrong   You come back another day   And do no wrong   You come back another day   And do no wrong   You come back another day   And do no wrong      The say the devil is paranoid   Always signin' the cover   But god is leakin' through the stereo   Between the station to station   You believe it, I know you do   You won't admit it or say so   I know that god is in the radio   Just repeating a slogan      You come back another day   And do no wrong   You come back another day   And do no wrong   You come back another day   And do no wrong   You come back another day   And do no wrong.Good evening, dear inspector   Lovely evening, my dear..But now wait a minute, I'm talking about:   Now, Joseph and his sweet wife, Mary,   You know, God come to Bethlehem that night,   Them find no place, yes he did, to born that she child,   Not a single room was in sight..I am so fab   Check out   I'm blonde   I'm skinny   I'm rich,   And I'm a little bit of a bitch      I wanna dress you up in silk, Taffeta   Tailor these clothes to fit your guilt, what's your size?.Life is lonely again,   And only last year everything seemed so sure..Samantha: ""Sorry, I thought he was coming."".Got to be a winner, trophy winner   Get to hold your head up high up!.Can we do it again      Take that, take that      [Chorus:]   You alright star   No star   You alright star   You alright star   No star   I don 't feel proper      I went to the dr to get a prescription   I told him little fact and lots of fiction   About a bad back that I ain't got   He tried to sell me faith healing   But I think not   I want Xanax, Vicadin and Oxycotton   Funky fill the form out   So I can drop em'   I've got all these demons   And I can't stop em'   To tell you the truth Doc   I might have a problem   Robert Williams take one adoral with water in the morning   As if I'm goin' to take one tablet I'm Keith Moon   Dick head      [Chorus 2:]   He said this one's to take you up   Wow how   He said this one's to take you down   When I take um I don't feel sound   And I look rather?"
"The obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there was nature itself. The winds on the top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Another obstacle would have to be that the builders didn't check the laws of the city because an aircraft can fly that low over urban areas such as New York City so this law prevented and made it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area. The last obstacle that the builders of the Empire State Building faced with public safety and this was the greatest reason. This project with the public in danger because if a dirigible went down in flames over a highly populated city like New York city it would be catastrophic! For example the German dirigible the Hindenburg did in lakehurst, New Jersey then the accident would be much worse & many people would die..Try yeah, try yeah, hey, hey, hey, try yeah,      Oh try whoa!.And here comes another grey morning..He said, 'Thanks for the ball, Dad..It must be imagination   God, I must be losin' my mind   It must be imagination   Does anybody know   Is there anyway to fight it?.I'm a sentimental mourner,   And I couldn't be forlorner,   When you keep me on that corner,   Just waiting for you..Yesterday I heard them say   A hero's blown away..You left me   Just when I needed you   You set me back   Just when I thought I got back   (Whistle, Do do do's, La la la's)   Just when I thought I got back..Moonlight and love songs   Never out of date..But I'm best known for   Blood and guts and gore   And a vicious reign of murdering and slaughter, oh!"
"The Greatest Obstacle the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there was nature itself. The wings on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigibles were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast. Dirigibles moored in open landing fields could be weighted down in the back with lead weights, but using these at the Empire State Building, where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street, was neither practical or safe.

"The builders faced a lot of issues to allow drigibles to land place on the Empire State Building. The builders had to be very cautious or carefull on building the platform to allow drigibles to dock. The drigibles (Blimp) were very big transportation machines that were made out of Steel and Cotton Fabric that was filled with hydrogen and helium. Hydrogen is a flamable substance which the builders had to be carefull with power and electricity supplies. To allow a blimp to dock above @NUM1 feet in the air on the Empire State Building, they need to work on the framing of the building so it there is any bad weather condition, the building would not collapse, and would be stable. Because of all these problems the procautions the builders had to make, makeing the mast was a failuer and left for the future transportations to plains..Now I'm lonely in love   Why must I be lonely in love   I'm so lonely in love   Baby why must I be lonely   Why must I be lonely in love..Let the sun sing in your smile   Let the wind hold your desire   Let your womans voice run through your veins   Let her be your blood don't feel ashamed      She's your home when no one wants you   She'll give you life when you're so tired   She'll ease your fears ah when you're a stranger   She's born to give faith to you   Oh, just to you      You're just a man on death's highways   It's life you owe you're here to praise it   If love flows your way then be a river   And when it dries just stand there and shiver      Oh, let the sun sing in your smile   Let the wind hold your desire   And let your womans voice run through your veins   Let her be your blood don't feel ashamed   It's her life you owe   I owe you love.Every ounce of me must see it through..Where are you now that I need you?.Hold my hand and we're halfway there..Shut up!.Whatever you are I swear, you'll be my angel..Who, who, who is it   Who, who, who is it   Who, who, who is it   Who, who, who is it   Who, who, who is it   Who, who, who is it   Who, who, who is it   What is it   What is it   What is it   What is it   Oh...Baby it's you!.Velma: Holy shit."
"The obstacles which the builders of the empire state building faced to allow dirigibles to dock there were numerous for this project. The first problem was that, other dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen. Hydrogen is a much more flammable substance than helium, which is what dirigibles in the United States used. The owners didn't want anything to occur similar to the German dirigible the Hindenburg, which would be worse in downtown New York instead of Lakehurst, New Jersey. Another practical reason why dirigibles faced problems docking at the Empire State building was that an existing law prevented dirigibles from flying too low over urban areas. For example a @ORGANIZATION1 dirigible named the Los Angeles, could not get close enough to tie up due to forceful winds. These problems go to show that owners of the Empire State building faced numerous obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock there..I've got the freight train blues, Lordy, Lordy, Lordy,   Got 'em in the bottom of my ramblin' shoes,   And when that whistle blows, I've gotta go,   Oh!.You don't get them girls loose loose (TJR!).Put your hawk in the sky   Side to side   Jump to the left   Stick it, glide..You've gotta understand my side   I've had a crazy, crazy life   Nobody came along to open up my eyes   You better take what you can get   Don't even bother with my heart   I get a feeling I won't let dissolve      Repeat 1      Please believe me   I've been down this road and back again   Learned a lesson and it was that love is not my friend   The day I put my trust in you   Will be the day I say I do   Don't expect me just to open up   Maybe I'm just a little scared   Please don't tell me what you think   I wanna hear   Oh baby save it   I've heard it all before   There ain't nothing you could say   Oh to make me change, no way      Repeat 1      So stop falling, stop falling   You know you're falling for me   Stop falling, stop falling   Stop falling for me, yeah      You've gotta understand my side   I've had a crazy, crazy life   Nobody came along to open up my eyes   Oh, baby take what you can get   Don't even bother with my heart   I get a feeling I won't let dissolve      Repeat 1      Stop falling, oh, hey, oh, oh yeah   Baby.How can we hang on to a dream,   How can it really be the way it seems ?.They always told me   You'd be right on my time....Am I better yet?.People I've known   Times on my own      And now I'm growing old,   In memory I can hold   My picture book unfolds and I   Can feel myself grow cold."
"The obstacles the builders of the Empire state Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there was that the had to be modified and strengthened. This cost them over @MONEY1 worth of modifications. They had to make these modifications so the dirigible can dock. All in All, these are the obstacles the builders of the Empire state building face in attempting to allow dirigible to dock..It's not a deal not a test nor a love of something fated..Find yourself another fool..Beautiful princess, fair and pale   Stares out across the sea   Alone in her castle dark and grey   Her love she'll never see   ""What am I doin' here?"".I am certainly and without a doubt   Fantastically well and was close to Spectacular but I must say   You just pissed spectacular off   And don't even mention exactly   But here comes fine right now      Oh lord, she is fine      Gentlemen      Behold      A lady.Nothing can hurt you at all..Paul: Yeah..Why do I miss you so if you're just a spec of dust,   Floating endlessly amongst the billion stars?.Go head, go head   Go head, go head   Go head, go head   Go head, baby girl go head   Go head, go head   Go head, go head   Go head, go head   Go head      [Chorus: x2]   Shawty gotta ass on ha (on ha)   I'ma put my hands on ha (on ha)   I'ma spend a couple grand on ha (on ha)   I'ma pop a rubber band on ha (on ha)      I'm tryna figure which chick I'ma see today (see today)..What a long, long time."
"The Empire State Building faced various obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Most importantly was the danger involved in this ambitious plan. Blimps from outside the @LOCATION3 commonly used hydrogen, a highly flammable gas, instead of helium. After a German dirigible destroyed in a fire, owners of the Empire State Building saw the true danagers of an accident like this in downtown New York. Successful use of the mooring mast was another obstacle. The winds at such a high altitude made it difficult to dock. Once docked the dirigibles would have to dangle above pedestrians, which was ""neither pratical or safe"". The existing law against airships flying to low in urban areas create further probles. After the Los Angeles failed to reach the mooring mast because of the high winds the owners started to see the unsolved problems. By the late 1930's the idea had ""quietly disappeared""..Hold me..How, how did I get here   What world is this   How, how did I get here   What world is this   Looking at forever   The ivory bones did speak   I walked the path to nowhere   Found there's nothing underfeet   Looking at forever   This river's running dry   The desert thirst   Has done her worst   She cursed my lullaby   How, how did I get here   What world is this   How, how did I get here   What world is this   The midnight sun burns holes   In the soles of my feet   I kneel before you   I say, please fuck me baby   Looking at forever   I cling to every limb   Please hold me tight   For the dead of night   Prefers my suffering...

"The builders of the Empire State building faced a few main obstacles in attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there atop the building. These three main obstacles where the designing of the mast and the building modifications, safety, and existing laws about aircrafts. The designing of the mast was an obstacle because a dirigible moored to the mast would add stress to the building's frame. The load and pressure had to be transmitted to the base of the building and they faced ""over sixty thousand dollar's worth of modifications"" to do so. One of the other problems was, most importantly, safety. The article states that most countries used hydrogen in their balloons to stay afloat, unlike the United States who used helium. This was dangerous for hydrogen is flammable, and the building owners did not want a repeat of the Hindenburg accident when a German dirigible was destroyed by fire. Also, a dirigible had to be weighted down or it'd spin around the mast and the commonly used lead weights were a hazard for pedestrians below. The last main obstacle of the Empire State building's builders was the existing law banning airships from flying low above urban areas. It would be illegal for a dirigible to approach the area let alone tether to the building. These are three of the main obstacles which the builders faced in building the Empire State building and its mast. Design, safety, and legal issues all were obstacles which got the better of the builders..[Chorus]   I still look for your face in the crowd   Oh if you could see me now   (Oh if you could see me now)   Would you stand in disgrace or take a bow   Oh if you could see me now   (Oh if you could see me now)      (Oh if you could see me now)      If you could see me now would you recognize me?.I can't breathe but now I'm startin' to choke   Off my own blood and not that indo smoke   No joke, straight up, on a serious tip   I'm losin' my life, I'm losin' my grip, I slip, s-s-slip deeper still   Help Lord, help Lord, I'm losin' my will   To live, low, stuck at the bottom   From winter to spring to summer to autumn   Help Lord, the homies in the hood   The squares, the G's, it's all good   Help Lord 'cause in the hood we sprung   And we stuck right here until you come   And bless the children of the ghetto life   No love, no hope, no hope, no life   Help Lord, help Lord, help Lord, help Lord   You hear me callin' Lord?.Boom, boom, ain't it great to be crazy?.Surely you cannot be leading me on?.Squibnocket, phone sex,   Just about to dial your number..I like to think about the time I met you   Living with your people down in new orleans   Mad at your mama cause she'd never let you   Ride in no nasty limousine   Later on the levee with the moon up above   I lost my heart and confessed my love   Oh lucy, God have mercy   I've got to stop thinkin' 'bout that      One summer night in a field of wheat   God's sweet lanterns hanging in the sky   Moving light on your tiny feet   I knew I had to love you till the day I die   They talk about amazing grace   It meant something when I saw your face   Oh lucy, God have mercy   I've got to stop thinkin' 'bout that      I think of all the little things that I never told you   I think I may get to hold you someday   It's my brain just like a man possessed   I can't do me no work, I can't get me no rest   I can't understand it baby      Don't like to think about the way it ended   I hate remembering the things that I said   I dream a dream of love so splendid   I wake up hard in an empty bed   I wonder who'll be loving you next   Some fool will be writing bad checks   Oh now lucy, God have mercy   I've got to stop thinkin' 'bout you.You must try thinking like a cloud sometime..The woman is out on her own..Going on a picnic, leaving right away   If it doesn't rain, we'll stay all day."
"The builders of the Empire State Building had to overcome many obstacles so the dirigibles could safely dock at the top to refuel or repair. People were thrilled for this idea, yet they knew how difficult this task would be. First of all, the building plan had to be redone due to the Chrysler building's builders tactic about sneaking around to make the building taller than the Empire State Building. Al Smith was not going to let that happen so he decided to make the @CAPS1.S.B. even taller. (1,250 ft.) secondly, the builders had to come up with a way to build the dock on a stable platform because it was unstable on the flat roof. This served as and obsticle because at such a height, construction is hard to do. Al Smith was more than determined though which enlightened the workers stated in paragraph @NUM1, ""over sixty thousand dollars"" worth of modifications had to be made to the buildings framework (Lüsted, @NUM1). Also, the dock or landing dock, could not be used weather permitting. The dirigibles so close to the city, building, and civilians was dangerous when swaying around. The author says, ""some were as long as one thousand feet, the same length as four blocks in New York City"" (6). There were violent wind currents that could make the dirigibles sway around the mooring mast. Last of all, an existing law against airships flying that low over urban areas was in place. This is a major contributor to the failed attempt. Being prohibited and breaking the law would get many in trouble. All and all, the attempt made by the architects of the Empire State Building proved dedication and good intentions, but their ideas were too irrational for the dock to become successful in society..Oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo!.Run!.I couldn't see   I couldn't hear   Shut me off when you were near   Like a cloud   A dusty mirror   Disappear, you disappear      All of a sudden   All alone   I'm calling out   I'm calling love's gonna let me know   Like the day you took me home   We counted every minute left to go   My love's gonna let you know      Time without you drags me down   It all feels right with you around   It all feels light with you around   Like that night we hit the ground   And all the lightning sends a chill   Can't forget about you still   All of a sudden all alone   I'm calling out   I'm calling      Love's gonna let me know   Like the day you took me home   We counted every minute left to go   My love's gonna let you know      Calling love's gonna let me know   Like the day you took me home   We counted every minute left to go   My love's gonna let you know      I'm calling out I'm calling   I'm calling out I'm calling   I'm calling out I'm calling   I'm calling out I'm calling   I'm calling out I'm calling out.Well it's two a.m.   You're just getting in   Soon you'll be creepin' into bed   Later you'll pretend   You were out with a friend   But I'm still inside your head..From the 12 inch single ""Nineteen"" by Phil Lynott with bonus Thin Lizzy track   Also appeared on the live Thin Lizzy album BBC Radio One Live In Concert 1983   A Night In The Life Of A Blues Singer   (Lynott)   In the old days   I could sing the blues   I had nothin' to live for   And nothin' to lose   And all the time   I was paying my dues   Like an old blues singer   And I had no troubles then   But I had lots of friends   Friends they come and go   And sometimes friendship ends   All the time, I've had a friend on whom I depend   So blues singer   Oh...

"It was unfortunate that such a great idea was never able to succeed. The builders of the Empire State building faced with many difficulties when trying to allow dirigibles to dock on the building. First they had to design the Mask which sounds like a long and complicated process. Everything seemed as if it was going to work out. Builders started construction. After two months of construction, the mooring mast was not able to fulfill its purpose for several reasons. hydrogen is highly flammible and to dangerous to use in such a highly populated area. Things such as wind and nature itself would have made this wonderful idea impossible. There were laws that would have never allowed for this to happen anyway. If builders and planners had done better research they would have found this project to have been impossible before going through all the intense construction..There's a light shining on her window   There's a great big guess breathing on her door   Shame it's taken all this time   All these years to find out   She's gonna change everything      I spend so much time sitting in shadows   I feel naked to the bone but I don't care, any more   Shame it's taken all this time   All these years to find out   She's gonna change everything      Oh everybody can't you see   What that angel's done to me   I'm hopelessly in bits   Hanging on to what I think I used to be   Somebody help me please   See this fool way down on his knees   She's gonna change everything you see in me   She's gonna change everything.I never heard you, baby, I never heard you anyway, no I didn't..Si par erreur la vie nous spare,   J'le sortirai d'mon tiroir..One, two, three...

"When designing the Empire State Building, architect Al Smith had the idea of futuristic Dirigible travel in mind. However, he faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at this giant building, as described in The Mooring Mast. Mooring a dirigible to the top of it ""... would add stress to the building's frame."" In order to allow dirigibles to dock, Smith had to modify the buildings frame: transmitting pressure all the way down to the foundation. Smith also faced the issue of foreign balloons; most of which used the highly flammable hydrogen, Instead of helium. A fire caused by a dirigible docked to the Empire State Building would rapidy spread to the city. Smith found that nature caused problems as well. Due to the changing winds atop the building, ""... the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast,"" @CAPS1 pedestrians. Because of all these obstacles, the idea of a dirigible mooring was given up, but the mast remains today. .Is this the best way we can grow our big orchards?.You're movin' just a little too fast,   I've got my foot down clear to the floor..I've never known anyone who could love me like you do,   You mean the world to me and I feel I mean as much to you..We were born to kill,   Best of the best   Nothing new, wild west   Let me put on that party dress   Hell, yes!.Let me say once more that I need you,   One more time or just maybe two..Let the one you hold be the one you want,   The one you need,   Cause when it's all for one it's one for all..Hear our praises   Hear your people sing   Hear our hearts cry   Your love is everything      And all will hear this shout   As the nations turn to you   And this will be your anthem      'cause we're all about you   And the world you promise   And all we have will give you praise   'cause we're all about you   And the world can't stop us   Living your way, always      Let our hearts break as we praise your name   Let the earth shake   This is the sound of faith      And the walls will fall down   And religion will break   And the nations will hear this shout   Can you hear the sound of faith?.Right now he's looking for his pants and socks   Can't find the car keys on the dresser top   He'll spill his milk and leave it in the kitchen floor   And as the day wears on he'll miss me more and more   He'll go to work without a kiss from me it'll cross his mind he siad I'd never leave   Forget his coat and catch a deaf of core   And as the day wears on he'll miss me more and more   [ dobro ]   He'll tell the guys he's bothered not at all   Then drink his lunch so he won't have to call   He'll tell himself I'm home like the day before   But as the day wears on he'll doubt it more and more   He'll come home to a house that's dark and quiet   And has to face another sleepless night   He'll watch TV and read and walk the floor   And as the day wears on he'll miss me more and more   And then he'll phone and ask me to come home   That things have gone to pieces cause I'm gone   His phonecall is all I'm waiting for   Cause as the day wears on I'll miss me more and more   Cause as the day wears on I'll miss me more and more.Hey babe, say you're mine, all mine."
"In the excerpt, ""The @CAPS1 Mast,"" by @PERSON1, the architects of the Empire State Building faced obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there.One of the problems the builders encountered was that the dirigible didn't have a suitable landing area. The architechs concluded that they couldn't just drop a @CAPS1 mast on top of their building, because it would add stress to its frame, so they had to strengthen, and modify it to make it work.Another obstacle. was the fact that most dirigibles ran on hydrogen, which is highly flamable. The builders realized how dangerous that could be, especially above a densely populated area such as downtown New York. They also realized that nature itself was their biggest obstace. Winds were constatly shifting due to violent air currents and they knew that this idea was neither practical nor safe. Lastly, There was a law against airships flying too low over urban areas, which would make their idea illegal and unsuccessful..Buck!.Ev'rything has got to be just like you want it to   Because      I pick a moon dog   Well you can radiate ev'rything you are   Yes you can radiate ev'rything you are   Ooh..[Verse 1]   That touch I felt was you,   I believe it   It felt like something you would do   How you, you keep reminding me   That you made me for yo, I knew,   That there would be some days   That cant be guaranteed to be blue,   Its true, but then where would I be without opportunities to,   Watch you change my broken life,   Hear you tell me its gon' be alright now,   See your plans come together in ways I cant even explain      [Chorus]   Together we been through hard times,   But Jesus I'm still in love with you,   I've had many loves in my life   But Jesus you make me feel brand new,   You know its hard for me to believe   That you love me no matter what I do   So how I live, I hope you can see   That I'm in love with you      [Verse 2]   The morning sun was you,   I appreciate it just what I needed to get through   Cause you knew I had a stressful day gotta get away   With you Jesus you you make me happy   If I wrote down all the things you do   The list would take forever I   Thought it might be better   To tell you why I smile is cause you,   You bring no drama in my life   It was dark but I can see the light now   Everything is so beautiful to me      [Chorus]      [Bridge]   Hey DJ turn it up it feels so good   To have somebody love you and your heart won't break   Hey DJ turn it up if you've been through love   You're Ready now to let go of yesterday   If you can hear me, get on up and get yourself together   He's callin you (yessir) its all for you (yessir)   If you don't know Jesus is so in love with you      [Rap]   You You, throw them hands up c'mon its for   You you, get it get it don't stop its for   You you, cant you feel it Jesus its for   You you, party people c'mon its for   You you, yea thats you just keep doing what you do   No one does me like you do   Thats why I'm so in love with you   Who?.I really didn't mean that."".A giant jail   A bunch of walls   That's all that we've made   Oh, my      We're the undefeated we got what they want   We're so bored and spoiled life is just a bag of pot   We're the undefeated we got what they want   We're so bored and spoiled life is just a bag of pot      We're the undefeated   Always undefeated   We're the undefeated   We're the undefeated,   Now.Have you ever ridden horses through a rainstorm?.Trapped in the cage of the skeleton ship   All the workmen suspended like flies   Caught in the flare of acetylene light   A working man works till the industry dies   And Billy would cry when he thought of the future      Then what they call an industrial accident   Crushed those it couldn't forgive   They brought Billy's father back home in an ambulance   A brass watch, a cheque, maybe three weeks to live,   And what else was there for a riveter's son   A new ship to be built, new work to be done      That night, he dreamed of the ship in the world   It would carry his father and he   To a place they could never be found   To a place far away from this town,   A Newcastle ship without coals   They would sail to the island of souls..(Lee) I lost Billies drugs, didn't get parid..Cry like you feel,   Try like you feel, feel it!"
"When the construction of the Mooring Mast on the Empire State Building was completed the builders began to face problems that should have been apparent from the begining. Some of the problems faced was there is a law in the U.S. that doesnt let aircraft fly close to or around cities and buildings. This meant they wouldn't be able to have the blimps tethered to the mast anyway. The highly violent and constantly changing weather and wind also posed a problem because it would be blowing the blimp everywhere, and its could not be weighed down with lead blocks like on land because it wouldn't be safe having them hang over the city. With the winds being crazy the blimp (most of them filled with hydrogen) could be punctured and set ablaze following towards the people on the ground. With those @CAPS1 being some of the most obvious problems some would think they wouldn't have attempted it but those obsticles were never overcome and the mooring mast still sits unused..When I'm feelin' lonely   And I'm far away from home   I just sing out your name   Like a one word song      In a moment of weakness   When I need to be strong   I just sing out your name   Like a one word song      And the thought of you   Brings a soulful melody   And passion and trust   And a healing harmony      When I count my blessings   There is one that stands alone   And I sing out your name   Like a one word song      And the thought of you   Brings a soulful melody   And passion and trust   And a healing harmony      And when I lose my way   I get back where I belong   When I sing out your name   Like a one word song      Yeah I sing out your name   Like a one word song..It's so good to see your smile..Hey, didn't you believe me when I told you I was leaving?.[Chorus]   You take my hand and give me your friendship..Don't step on your sandwiches!.Are you ready to roll, my rock boy?.Open your eyes, you see yours isn't the only way ..Star   We go waiting for the stars   To come showering down   From Moscow to Mars   Universe falling down      You got to look real hard   There's a fiery star   Hidden out there somewhere   Not the satellite of love   But a laser   Shooting out it's shiny tongue there      God is love, God is war   TV-preacher tell me more   Load redeem me, am I pure?.Attack!"
"The Mooring Mast by @ORGANIZATION2 is about the Empire State Building and the expectations that people had for it. In @DATE1 it was announced that the Empire State Building would reach the height of 1,250 feet. The point of the selection is to show that there was another idea that the Empire State building builders were trying to make a reality. The builders came across some obstacles while trying to allow dirigibles to dock there, such as the building not being stable enough to support the dirigibles, having to add frame work, and the possible dangers of making this idea a reality. ""The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would add too much stress to the buildings frame."". Because of this added stress ""the steel frame of the Empire State building would have to be modified and strengthened."" Then when a dirigible was destroyed, the owners of the Empire State building realized how much worse it could of been it happened in a place such as downtown @CAPS1"". It is a good thing they did not do the idea..He said      Wait!!!.Forever young, forever young, may you stay forever young..Whoo!.Kick off my shoes and relax my feet   Hit the kitchen grab a bite to eat   It's been one of those crazy weeks   And I gotta do something special for me      See, hit the salon get a mani and a pedi   Have a massage, get a sip and then I'm ready   Gotta take time out   And my real ladies know what I'm talking about      Sing..It's just the sun that's shinin' in your eyes..I know it's a lot to ask trust in me,   But I can make a difference right now you'll see..I know now, I know now, and it's too damn late..Come on man..Silly little things tonight,   Won't be right, out of sight."
"Many obstacles took place while builders of the Empire State building attempted to allow dirigibles to dock there. The stress of the blimps docking on the building would be too much. ""The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation"". Another problem was that dirigibles were highly flameable and in such a highly populated area of New York it ""was neither practical nor safe"". Laws against airships flying too low over urban areas worked against the idea but two dirigibles did attempt to reach the building before the entire idea was dropped..I'm gonna wear you down   I'm gonna make you see   I'm gonna get to you   You're gonna   Give in to me      I'm gonna start a fire   You're gonna feel the heat   I'm gonna burn for you   You're gonna melt for me      Come on, Come on in to my arms   Come on, Come on   Give in to me      You're gonna take my hand   Whisper the sweetest words   And if you're ever sad   I'll make you laugh   I'll chase the hurt      My heart is set on you   I don't want no one else   And if you don't want me   I guess I'll be all by myself      Come on, Come on, into my arms   Come on, Come on   Give in to me      I'll use my eyes to draw you in   Until I'm under your skin   I'll use my lips   I""ll use my arms   Come on, Come on   Give in to me      Give in to me.Take the last train to Clarksville,   Take the last train to Clarksville,   Take the last train to Clarksville,   Take the last train to Clarksville..I've gotta go deep and find the ones just right,   I'll bet my Leah'll be surprised tonight..You ain't gotta spend no money,   Just a little time with me honey,   That will let me know you love me so..And my throat is hot and dusty,   Down to the water I must go..As I went down in the river to pray   Studying about that good old way   And who shall wear the robe and crown   Good Lord, show me the way!.Rise..Jingle bells, jingle bells,   Jingle all the way!.That's why I'm marching, yes, I'm marching,   Marching down freedom's road."
"The construction workers faced many obstacles in building the Empire State building. One of those obstacles was hieght. Since they wanted to make the building the tallest building in the world they had to make sure there was enough technology to do so. Also they had to add an extra seventeen flores to the building making it 102 floors instead of its original @NUM1 floors. Another obstacle was its safety issues. The construction workers never checked into problems with building the mooring mast. In paragraph @NUM2 the author States, ""The as yet unsolved problems of mooring air ships to afixed mass at such a height made it describable to post pone to a later date the final installation of the landing gear."" the author is trying to say that when designing the production of the mooring mass; ""they overlooked certain issues that make them set back the final date.

"One obstacle the builders of the Empire state Building in attempt to allow dirigibles was, the stress from the mass & the dirigible and wind pressure would all be transmitted to the buildings foundation. The frame of the building would have to be strengthened to accommodate the new situation. There were also safety reasons. Since most states used hydrogen in stead of helium and hydrogen is flammable. If something were to happen and the dirigible was to catch fire. The fire could destroy New York City since it's so densely populated. The biggest obstacle was nature itself. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. It the dirigible was tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around the mooring mast.

"The builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. While designing the mast, the architects faced problems including wind pressure, safety, and practicality. The frame was not strong enough to undergo the stress and wind pressure from the load of the dirigible. The foundation of the building, which was approximately @NUM1 feet below, would have had to be strengthened and modified if it was going to be able to handle the movement of the dirigible attached by a single cable tether. Safety was the greatest obstacle that the builders faced most dirigibles used hydrogen to make them lighter than the air. However, this hydrogen was highly flammable causing many dangers. Since New York City is such a thickly settled area, the risk of a fire was too dangerous to take. Finally, instead of dirigibles landing in open fields they would have to dock eleven hundred feet above the ground in the words of Marcia Amidon Lüsted, ""using these (dirigibles) at the Empire State Building, where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street, was neither practical nor safe."".Cause if you invite her over      this is what might happen:         Rape!.Pizza, pizza pie   Every minute, every second   Buy, buy, buy, buy, buy   What a splendid pie?.The desk clerk wakes and begins to shout,   ""Can you see anything?"".Well, I needed it this morning   Without a shadow of doubt..What's the point saying ""Rescue me!"".The reign of terror corruption must end   And we know deep down there's   No other way   No trust, no reasoning, no more to say      Afraid to shoot strangers   Afraid to shoot strangers.I stubbed my toe   If you'd just quit leaving your shit all over the fucking floor   Fuck it, you're dead anyway   And I'm gonna leave your head smack dab in the hallway   In the morning, when your daddy walks out   AAAAHHH!!!.They say that love often passes in a second   And you never can catch it up   So I'm hanging on to you as though eternity beckoned   But it's clear that the match is rough   Common sense 'd tell me not to try 'n continue   But I'm after a piece of that diamond in you      So keep an eye open   My spirit ain't broken   Your love's so incredible   Your body so edible   You give me an overdose of love   Just a little is a enough      I'm connoisseur of champagne cognac   The perfume nearly beats the taste   I eat an oyster, and I feel the contact   But more than one would be a waste   Some people want an endless line, that's true   But all I have's a little time with you      A smile sets me reeling   A kiss feels like stealing   Your love is like heroin   This addict is mellowing   I can't pretend that I'm tough   Just a little is enough      Just like a sailor heading into the seas   There's a gale blowing in my face   The high winds scare me but I need the breeze   And I can't head for any other place   Life would seem so easy on the other tack   But even a hurricane won't turn me back      You might be an island   On the distant horizon   But the little I see   Looks like heaven to me   I don't care if the ocean gets rough   Just a little is enough      Common sense 'd tell me not to try and continue   But I'm after a piece of that diamond in you   So keep an eye open   My spirit ain't broken   Your love's so incredible   Your body so edible   You give me an overdose of love   A little is enough.When you smiled, just for me you smiled,   For a while I forgot I was Wednesday's child."
" The builders had to go through many obstacles to @CAPS1 to allow the dirigible to dock on the @ORGANIZATION2. The first thing that was a problem with geting it to the top of the Empire State Building. They said the wind made it really hard to get the dirigible up there with out it poping. There was also the safty of it being up there. There was already a fire from another dirigible catching on fire. The gases inside are really flamable and that would make a really big problem. The last thing that they had to conider was if Airships were to Low. The dirigible would pop. for all those reason they had to concider them to @CAPS1 to allow the dirigible on the Empire State Building..Because there's hands out of nowhere, saving me again..I'd surrender everything   To feel the chance to live again   I reach to you   I know you can feel it too   We'd make it through   A thousand dreams I still believe   I'd make you give them all to me   I'd hold you in my arms and never let go   I surrender      Every night's getting longer   And this fire is getting stronger, baby   I'll swallow my pride and I'll be alive   Can't you hear my call   I surrender all      I'd surrender everything   To feel the chance to live again   I reach to you   I know you can feel it too   We'll make it through   A thousand dreams I still believe   I'll make you give them all to me   I'll hold you in my arms and never let go   I surrender      Right here, right now   I give my life to live again   I'll break free, take me   My everything, I surrender all to you      Right now   I give my life to live again   I'll break free, take me   My everything, I surrender all to you.It's a lonely ol nigh   Custom made for two lonely people like me and you      Radio playin' softly   Some singer's sad sad song   He's singing about   Standing in the shadows of love   I guess it feels awfully alone   She says I know exactly what he means   Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah   And it's a sad sad sad sad feeling   When you're living on those in betweens   (But it's ok)      [Chorus:]   It's a lonely ol' night   Can I put my arms around you?.and let me come through   Is it true before you die do you really see it coming Do the hardest nigga crying start running?.The honesty of my music has left me too exposed..Alright, alright   I kiss the moon and hug the sun   O yeah oh well oh well   You people from the islands   Know about the Obeah woman   I didn't put the name on myself   And I don't like it   Sometimes, but the weight is too heavy   The weight is too heavy   Let' finish it.Hungry people don't stay hungry for long   They get hope from fire and smoke as the weak grow strong   Hungry people don't stay hungry for long   They get hope from fire and smoke as they reach for the dawn      Spirit of Jackson now scream from the ruins   Through factory chains and the ghost of the union   Forgotten remains disappear to the new home   Knife, the thrust, the life burns to the raw bone      Blood on the floor but the tear is still dryin'   Cover the spread sheets, the Dow Jones skyin'   Cell block, live stock, the bodies, they buyin'   Old South order, new northern horizon      Violence in all hands, embrace it if need be   Living been warfare, I press it to cd   Violence in all hands, embrace it if need be   Living been warfare, I press it to cd      A fire in the master's house is set   A fire in the master's house is set   A fire in the master's house is set   A fire in the master's house is set      Hungry people don't stay hungry for long   They get hope from fire and smoke as the weak grow strong   Hungry people don't stay hungry for long   They get hope from fire and smoke as they reach for the dawn      Yo, yo, check the high tech terror, it's the new order athletes   Peer into the eyes of the child already on trial   All this rippin' families apart, get 'em on file   Convictions fit the stock profile all the while      Films of dogs ripping through homes, ripping skin from bones   Yes, the new millennium homes   Or privatizing through private eyes and an era rising   Of the Old South order, new northern horizon      Violence in all hands, embrace it if need be   Living been warfare, I press it to cd   Violence in all hands, embrace it if need be   Living been warfare, I press it to cd      A fire in the master's house is set   A fire in the master's house is set   A fire in the master's house is set   A fire in the master's house is set.Here's a song for all the little men, who get forgotten   Trodden time and time again   Here's a message for the little guy, don't let this situation pass you by   You're in the middle while the big mouths fight   You get it from the left and the right, ain't it crazy      So get out of your easy chairs, we've got a lot to do out there   Well ain't we   Good's gone bad but right is wrong and I don't know which side I'm on lately      Get up from the down you are in   Come out of your homes and let's see your faces   Get up out of your easy chairs, get up and show 'em that you're there   Get up it's your one salvation   Wise up to the situation      Somebody gotta get up and shout   Somebody gotta give us some clout   You're the ones to make it all work out   It all depends on you      Get up off your arses men   Don't let 'em think you're getting lazy   Get up out of your easy chairs   We gotta lot to do out there, well ain't we   Get up, get up, get up,   Get up, get up, get up.I wouldn't reach up to the sky,   Every night, in my dreams."
"Having the empire state building dock and hold dirigibles brought up so hefty problems for the builders. Most of the problems resided among the idea of a mast, Al Smith knew that the mass would put to much pressure on the building frame, another was the baloon it's self, besides the U.S. most dirigibles were made of hydrogen rather than helium. The hydrogen made it much more dangerous to have in the crowded down town New York area, because hydrogen was much more flamable. a third obstacl was the winds as said ""the winds on top of the building were constantley shifting due to violent air currents."" It was also illegal to fly/hold or dock a air craft so close to the ground. The docking and holding of the dirigibles at the Empire State building brought many issues and delemas making it hard to carry out such a idea for such a tall building..I'm a woman..But the picture is coming back   Now baby   And I want to take it all      Don't go making all these promises   You know you cannot keep   There's a time to play a king and a   Time to be a thief   Cause if you're making all these   Promises you know you cannot keep   You know time will be the thief and   Your fallen king end up alone      So let your body move a little bit closer   Silent like the sound proceeding a cyclone   Don't you know that powerful thinking   Can be a force you don't want   To relinquish?.I see you standing there far out along the way,   I want to touch you but the night becomes the day,   I count the words that I am never gonna say   And I see you midnight blue..Stomp!.Do you wanna try?.I cried when I missed you      Look at us now..Me and my girl got this relationship..The witch keeps sellin' me!.No blood no glory   All pain and fury   A demonstration   Of domination   Show of pure intimidation      Full contact why I live and breathe   Side stepping all the human debris   Head strong I know that I'll prevail   Face down in my arena you will fall   Head to head eye to eye   Human pile of proven pride   Ripping flesh spitting teeth   Sacrifice for victory   Base line goal lie   Overtime killing time   Relentless brotherhood of disciple   Centuries of traditions is to win   Head first into battle feel the rush   Living on adrenaline your try is crushed      No blood no glory   All pain and fury   Head to head eye to eye   Human pile of proven pride   Ripping flesh spitting teeth   Sacrifice for victory   Base line goal line   Overtime killing time"

"There were many obsticles the builders faced when attempting to dock dirigibles on the Empire State Building. First off, there was a great safety concern. Many dirigibles from foriegn countries used helium instead of hydrogen; while helium is very flamlable, therefore the dirigible might explode. Second, the wind made it very challenging to dock the dirigibles. The winds were always changing because the violent air currents. Finally, there was already a law in place against airships flying to low over urban areas. So even if they fixed the other problems it would still be illegal to dock the dirigibles. Those are some problems the builders faced when attempting to dock dirigibles..This is the end!!!!.It's like a film - such balance..Good evening Ladies and Gentleman I'm Niah Pitson I'm standing in front of the historic Manns chinese theatre where thousands literally thousands of fans, journalists and well wishers have gathered merely to catch a glimpse of the artists formerly known as fresh prince..Will you ever take me?.Two!.How long would it take me   To be near if you beckon?.Cause girl, lovin' you is so easy..A knock on the door in the night   (In the night In the night ...)

"There were many obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there.  One obstacle was the stress on the building from the dirigible.  The stress of the dirigibles load and the wind pressure would have had to be transmitted all the way to the buildings foundation which was @NUM1 feet below.  So the steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened Another obstacle was that most dirigibles from outside the U.S use hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable.  The third obstacle was the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents.

Lastly, the last obstacle with the existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas.  This would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area.

"Engineering a docking station was supposed to be a great accomplishment for the city of New York. Unfortunately, builders faced many obstacles in trying to make this incredible plan flourish. Many engineers did not think of the hazards and for ""reasons that should have been apparent before it was even constructed"" (@CAPS1 @NUM1).The greatest issue was safety. Dirigibles used a highly flammable gas, hydrogen, and if an incident like the Hindenburg were to occur again, it would be an immense danger to the densely populated city.Another obstacle were the winds at the top of the Empire State Building. The winds were constantly shifting and the backs of dirigibles would swing around and around.There was also a law against low flying aircraft over urban areas. so it was illegal for a ship to ever even approach the area. The idea for a docking station was great, however, many obstacles were not brought up in the early @CAPS2 of planning, so the Empire State Building never came to be a dock..if only I could see you..Didn't I, didn't I, didn't I,   See you cryin' (cryin, cryin')..Praise Him sun and moon, praise Him shining stars   All created things made at His command   Governments and kings, nations of the earth   Gather young and old to worship   Let everything that has breath      Shout praise to His name   To the name above all names   Sing glory, hallelujah   Hallelujah to His name   King Jesus, Jesus be praised      Underneath our feet there's a shaking   As the church awakes to it's calling   Hope is rising strong, freedom's coming   Heaven and earth unite in worship   Let everything that has breath      Shout praise to His name   To the name above all names   Sing glory, hallelujah   Hallelujah to His name   King Jesus, Jesus be praised      What you want, what you know   We've got to make His kingdom grow   What you want, what you know   We've got to make His kingdom grow      The King is coming, King is coming   Let everything that has breath praise Him   The King is coming, King is coming   Let everything that has breath praise Him      The King is coming, King is coming   Let everything that has breath praise Him   The King is coming, King is coming   Let everything that has breath      Shout praise to His name   To the name above all names   Sing glory, hallelujah   Hallelujah to His name      Shout praise   Sing glory   Hallelujah to His name   King Jesus, Jesus   King Jesus, Jesus be praised.What does it mean?.Violent, more violent, his hand cracks the chair,   Moves on reaction, then slumps in despair,   Trapped in a cage and surrendered too soon,   Me in my own world, the one that you knew,   For way too long..I am!.Say goodbye to Old Man Winter   Say hello to sweet springtime   'Cause I'm coming out of hiding   I'm gonna get it right this time      After so long being frozen   It took a while to thaw me out   I spent too long not knowing   What love's supposed to be about      Now I'm finding out      [Chorus:]   It's a lot like coming home   From a long time walking out in the snow   Then I looked at you and knew I never knew nothing   And it broke this heart of stone   It's a lot like coming home      Like a bird out on the harbor   That's been battered by the sea   I've been through some stormy weather   But you shine a light for me   Girl, you set me free      [Chorus]      Yeah      Girl, I looked at you and knew I never knew nothing   And it broke this heart of stone   It's a lot like coming home   Coming home   Feels like I'm coming home, coming home, coming home   Coming home, coming home, coming home, coming home      Oh baby, I'm coming home, coming home, coming home   Coming home, coming home, coming home, coming home      I'm coming home      (Coming home, coming home, coming home, coming home   Coming home, coming home)      (Coming home, coming home, coming home, coming home   Coming home, coming home)      (Coming home, coming home, coming home, coming home   Coming home, coming home).Just sign right here, son, everything'll be alright."".I had to practice it while everybody slept."
"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many challenges with dirigibles. The first being that with the large size of the aircrafts it would put much stress on the building and so a new frame was created to accomadate the @NUM1 ft dirigibles. Sixty thousand dollars was needed for modifications. Another problem was safety. A lot of dirigibles out of the United States used hydrogen which is highly flammable and different accident like in New Jersey, where the blimp caught fire, were to happen in the heavely populated New York a lot of injuries and deaths would occur. A third reason is nature. Since the building stood so tall, wind speeds and pressure was very unpredictable, especially with the violent air currents. In open fields weights were used to stabilize dirigibles, but having lead weights ""dangling high above pedestrians... was neither practical nor safe."" @CAPS1, there were laws against flying at certain altitudes in urban areas. The Empire State Building being at the height it was, was still illegal to have a dirigible or other craft tie up to it. Those are obstacles the builders faced when building the Empire State Building..So I'll pretend,   And we'll all be happy   But in the end   There's no telling when   You'll slip off the edge   And you start up again   But I'm not the same child   Who just had no defense      Don't tell me your lies, lies, lies...

"There were a few challenges that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The mast couldn't just be dropped on the top of the building. ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame."" All this stress would be transmitted to the foundation of the building. Another obstacle was the builders had to modify the whole building. The architects had designed the mooring mast and made changes to existing plans for the building's skeleton."" The builders already had the building done but in order to dock the dirigibles, they needed to change the building. These architects worked hard to build something that could never be used because of the violent air currents.

"In The Mooring Mast by @ORGANIZATION2, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles to allow dirigibles to dock there. One big obstacle they had to overcome is when the dirigibles dock it would leave stress on the foundation of the building. ""Over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the buildings framework."" Another obstacle the builders would have to overcome was the winds at the top of the building constantly shifting directions. They thought about putting weights on the dirigibles but then that would not be safe having them hang a thousand feet up over people. There was also a law stating that airships could not fly too low over urban areas.

"In their attempts to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building, the builders faced many obstacles. Firstly, the frame of the Empire State building was too weak to take on the extra stress of dirigible's load. Builders sat out to strengthen the building frame, a sixty-thousand dollar feat. Secondly, builders struggled with high, shifting winds. These winds made docking a dirigible nearly impossible, because ""the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" Another obstacle builders faced were safety issues. The insides of many dirigibles were filled with hydrogen, a highly flammable gas that allowed the dirigible to float. After a dirigible fire in New Jersey, builders realized the dangers of dirigibles and what would happen if a dirigible caught on fire above New York City. Finally, builders also faced the laws regarding air traffic. The laws prevented airships from flying ""too low over urban areas."" in the end, the obstacles prevented builders from letting dirigibles dock on the Empire State Building..He sets out on a dark May morning ..And for thirty silver pieces..There is moonlight and moss in the trees   Down the Seven Bridges Road..I've been feelin' good but   I know it won't be long.'.If you will be the girl, the girl who saved her love for a rainy day..Seems like most of the time you're lyin' there dreamin'..Doo-doo-doo-doo..Got my risin suspicion got my eye on you      If you got something to say well I think you better tell us now..I sometimes wonder if this spell that I'm under,   Can only be a melody for I know no one but me,   Has won your heart but when the music starts:   My peace departs,   From the moment they play that lovely strain   And we surrender to all it's charm again."
"In the excerpt The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, the builders faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock over the Empire State Building. If the builder's would want to dock the dirigibles they couldnt because there was no right area to land them. ""... in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area"". Another obstacle was they would have to know the kind of weather because nature it's self can take control. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" The dirigibles if landed on the Empire State Building would be weighed down because in the back would lead weights so, it would weight it down. Another reason that it was an obstacle was because dirigibles used a gas of hydrogen rather than helium and the gas hydrogen is a highly flammable gas that can do a lot of harm if there are passengers present in the dirigibles and could be very dangerous for the Empire State Building..The sea so deep and blind   Where still the sun must set   And time itself unwind   O love, aren't you tired yet?.Who can say what it means?.Birds flying high you know how I feel   Sun in the sky you know how I feel   Breeze driftin' on by you know how I feel..I can't live without us,   So I hope that you will   Stay with me forever..My name is Diogenes   I'm not one to say thanks or please   Poked statues and walked barefoot   In the snow..We both made a promise,   That we'd never part,   Let's seal it with a kiss,   Forever my sweetheart!.Hard as a rock..Still on fire.Sometime I feel   Like a motherless child   Sometimes I feel   Like a motherless child   And sometimes I feel   Like a motherless child   A long...long way...from home      Whooaoo      And Sometimes I feel   Like I'm almost gone   Sometimes I feel whooaoo   Like I'm almost gone   Sometimes I feel yeahehe   Like I'm all alone   A long...a looong wayee from home      C'mon, c'mon   Who's got a shoulder when I need to cry   I feel restless and I don't know why   Cry for help, but still feel alone   Like A motherless child along way from home   Lord I'm lost I can't find my way   I'm dealin' with the struggles in my day to day   My soul is weak and I wanna be strong   I try to run away but I've been running to long      I've been running to long..."
"While in the process of building the Empire State Building the workers overcome countless obstacles. Al Smith, the governor of New York, wants to build ""the world's tallest building"" (1). At the same time the Empire State building is being designer the @ORGANIZATION2 building, also in New York, is finishing construction The @ORGANIZATION2 building workers decide they want to challenge the designers of the Empire State Building by secretly building a 185-foot spire and making their building 46 feet taller. This begins a competition between the designers to see who will win the title of the tallest building. Later on, after the Empire State building is built and wins the title of the tallest building, the workers are trying to make it work as a mast for dirigibles the land on. The designers forgot to factor in the safety of landing a dirigible in the middle of a city and the fact that wind is a huge factor in landing the aircraft safely. The idea of the building for acting as a landing for dirigibles is dropped.

"The people who were attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State went through many obstacles. They would first have to modify and strengthened the buildings frame to accommodate this new situation. The architects designed a shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel tower that would be illuminated from inside, with a stepped-back design that imitated the overall shape of the building itself. After doing all of that work they then found out that the mast of the Empire State building would never work. The greatest reason was saftey. Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used Hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. The biggest obstacle was nature itself. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. The other practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the empire state building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. The law made it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area. By the late 1930's the idea of using the mooring mast for dirigibles and their passengers had quietly disappeared. Dirigibles instead of becoming the transportation of the future, had given way to airplanes..I had a job, I had a girl   I had something going, mister, in this world   I got laid off down at the lumber yard   Our love went bad, times got hard   Now I work down at the car wash   Where all it ever does is rain   Don't you feel like you're a rider on a downbound train      She just said, ""Joe, I gotta go   We had it once, we ain't got it anymore""   She packed her bags, left me behind   She bought a ticket on the Central Line   Nights as I sleep, I hear that whistle whining   I feel her kiss in the misty rain   And I feel like I'm a rider on a downbound train      Last night I heard your voice   You were crying, crying, you were so alone   You said your love had never died   You were waiting for me at home   Put on my jacket, I ran through the woods   I ran till I thought my chest would explode   There in the clearing, beyond the highway   In the moonlight, our wedding house shone   I rushed through the yard   I burst through the front door, my head pounding hard   Up the stairs I climbed   The room was dark, our bed was empty   Then I heard that long whistle whine   And I dropped to my knees, hung my head and cried   Now I swing a sledge hammer on a railroad gang   Knocking down them cross ties, working in the rain   Now, don't it feel like you're a rider on a downbound train.Maybe tonight I'll get lucky   I've been lonely too long   Maybe tonight some dark stranger   Will hear me singing this song   I've been down, I've played around   I don't like it that way   Love, won't you treat me right   Maybe tonight?.I can't stay here, there's something wrong here..Midsummer new yorks waiting for the rain..That's what you've got to do, when it's all over   That's what you've got to do, when it's all over   That's what you've got to do, when it's all over   That's what you've got to do, when it's all over   Greetings from the gutter   I've been here since yesterday   Sweet dreams in the gutter   All the skeletons come out to play   At times I feel so logical inside   So just give me the keys   And I'll drive myself back home   That's what you've got to do, when it's all over   That's what you've got to do, when it's all over   That's what you've got to do, when it's all over   That's what you've got to do, when it's all over   I stand in the mirror counting the scars I let you see   A little soft edged but bitter   You're a star you don't talk to me   That's what you've got to do, when it's all over   That's what you've got to do, when it's all over   That's what you've got to do, when it's all over   That's what you've got to do, when it's all over.Oh!).[Chorus]   You're my shining star   That is what you are   There is no one like you baby   Angels everywhere   Every time you're near   You will always be my baby      Baby when you do the things you do   I want to be close to you   Cause I need to feel your every move, oh   Baby I can never say how much   I need your touch, I can't get enough   Cause you know what to do to turn me on, yeah      [Chorus]      Baby you're as close as close can get   And baby you know I'd let   Every single part of me be yours, ooh yeah   It doesn't matter if the phone might ring   Cause I won't hear a thing when I'm in your arms   Cause you know what to do to turn me on      [Chorus]      I've never been so satisfied   With anything in my entire life   Cause you are doing everything so right   Oh, oh baby   I've never been so satisfied   With anything in my entire life   Cause you are doing everything so right   Oh, oh baby      [Chorus]      You know that I adore you   want to be there everyday for you   To satisfy your every needs my baby, baby   You know that I adore you   want to be there everyday for you   To satisfy your every needs my baby, baby      [Chorus].This dirty city is my sugar town   My little angel of death is my nightlife      You better make a move before I get bored   If you wanna explore my vocal chord   Leave the girl a go-go dance in the cooch   One hand on my knee one hand on the hooch   Why don't you stick around for one more round?.Naked, naked, naked,   Sitting cross-legged."
"Many problems arised with the docking of dirigibles at the Empire State Building for that the engineers did not account. While the architects were designing the mast, they realized that the building was not built to withstand the stress of dirigibles and the wind. ""... modifications had to be made"" (paragraph @NUM1). Though this obstacles was able to be overcome, many others were not. Since most dirigibles outside of the @PERSON1 used hydrogen, a very flammable gas, a dirigibles could go down in flames similar to the German Hindenburg, and ""owners... realized how much worse that accident could have been... above... New York"" (paragraph @NUM2). Another obstacle was a problem with a ""law against airships flying too low over urban areas"" (paragraph @NUM3). No dirigible would be allowed even close to the building; however, two still tried but neither could tether safely to the building. The thought of the transportation of the future moved on to airplanes and the Empire State Building's top floors are now a public tourist spot..No I haven't forgotten how we used to fight   I finally got married and settled on down   Yeah she's a preachers daughter in a sleepy little town   Does she make you laugh since we said goodbye?.Why will it take so long   Until I can see you again....""Oh, where will the wedding supper be?"".Slide zone, slide zone,   Slide zone, time zone..She whispered in my ear, saying those things that only   A mac would like to hear..So when I beg...you avoid me...because I smell of dirt...hungry,   Hungry boy...you won't leave me all alone...the boy won't go      Sooner or later we're done   Sooner or later I'm gone   Because, because   Sooner or later we're gone   Sooner away      Ooh, my head is pounding now...god has all but left me behind...

"In the passage, The Mooring Mast by @ORGANIZATION2, the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there are out lined. These obstacles were safety, nature, and law, Safety was an obstacle because the passengers on the dirigibles would be put in danger. This is evident in the line, ""...dirigibles from outside of the @LOCATION1 used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" The dirigibles could have blown up, as many have in the past. Nature was an obstacle because the dirigibles could have a hard time attaching to the mast if the weather is un desirable. This is supported in the quotation, ""...winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" The wind could cause the dirigibles to move around uncontrollably, which wouldn't be very safe for anyone. There was a law against airships in urban areas that was an obstacle. This law is explained in the quotation, ""this law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area."" This law made it unnecessary to have the mooring mast, as it could not be legally used. The obstacles outlined in the passage The Mooring Mast by @ORGANIZATION2, allowed the architects to avoid wasting funds on something that wouldn't be profitable..He was constantly going to the coffee shop   Always getting the best herb and the best   Hash, you know?.Glory!.Cause baby, I believe   That love will find a way..Would you settle for a mobile home   A good record store and a public phone      If we can't get it together, if we can't get it together..If I cried out loud   over sorrows I've Known   And the secrets I've heard   It would ease my mind   Someone sharing the load   But I won't breathe a word      We're two of a kind   Silence and I   We need a chance to talk things over   Two of a kind   Silence and I   We'll find a way to work it out      While the children laughed   I was always afraid   of the Smile of the clown   So I close my eyes   Till I can't see the light   And I hide from the sound      We're two of a kind   Silence and I   We need a chance to talk things over   Two of a kind   Silence and I   We'll find a way to work it out      I can hear the cry   Of the leaf on a tree   As it Falls to the ground   I can hear the call   of an Echoing voice   And there's no one around      We're two of a kind   Silence and I   We need a chance to talk things over   Two of a kind   Silence and I   We'll find a way to work it out.[Chorus]   I love you more than anything   Than anything, I do..And did you have to pay that fine   You was dodging all the time   Are you still busy?.too long and now it?s my time   To show ?em all that it?s not a game   ?Cause I don't care what I'm looking like   I just gotta show you that I'm not going nowhere   You think you know me but you have no idea   Act like you're ?bout it, well let me put this in your ear   If you really ?bout it [incomprehensible] like you don't care   If you ?bout it I don't doubt it   Show me that you're sho?.How can we start over when the fighting never ends, baby?"
"Everyone would like to jump in a dirigible and transport from one location to the next. Although, there are many challenges the builders faced in attempt to doing so. One of these challenges included the amount of stress the single cable tether from the dirigible would add to the building. Also, wind pressure is a dangerous factor which needed to be taken into consideration, because the dirigible is so heavy, that it could easily fly off and hit someone. The building would also have to be strengthened to hold the dirigible which would cost over sixty thousand dollars. One of the most important reasons against allowing the dirigible to dock there is because it could easily catch on fire."" The greatest reason was one of safety: Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is very flammable."" (para @NUM1) Overall, due to the dangerous factors in allowing the dririgible to dock there, these will always override the pros, and maybe one day technology can create a safe way to do so..I got to get through to you..Sinners like me need another heaven   Turn back?.You look, so good   I cant, believe it   I'm out (my), my mind (mind)   I shouldn't be but (oh)   Women like you steal my control   Seen it across   My spot is next door   Come on (girl)   Girl don't (girl don't) be scared (be scared)   Now Baby      [Chorus]   Help me help me help me   I want you to help me help me help me   I cant stop myself   You have been lovely   I wanna have you screamin'   Love me roughly      I need a little bit of help   Keep raisin the body count   When ever i take em out   I end up takin em down   Can you help me help me help me   Shoot me or somthin   Help me help me help me   Do me or somthin   I need help      We're here, (so) alone (good)   I got, a problem   I'm out (my) my mind (mind)   Over your body   (Shouldn't be but oh)   Women like you steal my control   Seen it across   My spot is next door   Come on girl (girl)   Girl don't (girl don't) be scared (be scared) now baby      Help me help me help me   I want you to help me   Help me help me   I cant stop myself   You have been lovely   Wanna have you screamin' love me roughly   I need a little bit of help   Keep raisin the body count   When ever I take em out I end up takin' em down      Can you help me help me help me   Shoot me or somethin'   Help me help me help me   Do me or somethin'   I need help      Wont you help me cause I cant leave it alone   I cant stop it   cause every time I get it alone   I gotta pop it   Its like that I be feelin' too grown   I'm fein'in I be club hoppin'   Tryna' get somethin' poppin'   And I   When I get her alone   Already knowin' i'm on it   I ain't tryna' be good   So I'ma let you know   Its like woah   I need help tryna get this some control      [Chorus]      I need a little bit of help   Keep raisin the body count   When ever i take em out   I end up takin' em down   Can you help me help me help me   Shoot me or sumthin'   Help me help me help me   Do me or sumthin'   I need help      [Chorus]      I need a little bit of help   Keep raisin the body count   When ever I take em out   I end up takin' em down   Can you help me help me help me   Shoot me or somethin'   Help me help me help me   Do me or somtehin'   I need help.But I'm near the end and I just ain't got the time   And I'm wasted and I can't find my way home..Such a shame he took it all..He is mighty..The blink of an eye, you know it's me..Time and Space hang heavy on my shoulders:   when all life is over who can say   no mutated force shall remain?.Tell her the truth now, don't be afraid."
"Based on the excerpt, ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lüsted. One of the obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced was that the airship couldn't moor at the Empire State Building because the winds on top of the building were constantly changing due to violent air currents. Another obstacle but the builders faced was that there was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law would make it illegal for airships if they ever try to approach the area..Trouble, oh trouble,   I've trouble on my mind   Trouble, oh trouble,   Trouble on my mind..Here we are now   Everything is about to change   We face tomorrow as we say goodbye to yesterday   A chapter ending but the stories only just begun   A page is turning for everyone   So I'm moving on   Letting go   Holding on to tomorrow   I've always got the memories while I'm finding out who I'm gonna be   We might be apart but I hope you always know   You'll be with me wherever I go   Wherever I go   So excited I can barely even catch my breath   We have each other to lean on for the road ahead   This happy ending is the start of all our dreams   And I know your heart is with me   So I'm moving on   Letting go   Holding on to tomorrow   I've always got the memories while I'm finding out who I'm gonna be   We might be apart but I hope you always know   You'll be with me wherever I go   It's time to show the world we've got something to say   A song to sing out loud we'll never fade away   I know I'll miss you but we'll meet again someday   We'll never fade away   So I'm moving on   Letting go   Holding on to tomorrow   I've always got the memories while I'm finding out who I'm gonna be   We might be apart but I hope you always know   You'll be with me wherever I go   So I'm moving on   Letting go   Holding on to tomorrow   I've always got the memories while I'm finding out who I'm gonna be   We might be apart but I hope you always know   You'll be with me wherever I go   Wherever, Wherever I go.Sing yeah for the Beatle and the Stone   These were the days   Yeah yeah yeah   -repeat chorus-.Is there really just,   One chance   At a new start   But just one glance   Tells you it doesn't matter   So you turn 'round so you   Don't have to face it..The answer, my friend, is blowin' in the wind   The answer is blowin' in the wind..Uh Mr. Smith, Mr Smith, Mr Smith   Uh Mr Smith, it's the bomb y'knowhutI'msayin?.Now if you want to say goodbye to your girl   I want to give you one or two little tips, yeah..Pass Me By   ""Does this excite you?.(Violent J)   I'll never question the book, but let's say I lived by the book   I never ate meat on Tuesdays, how much bigger would my wings look?"
"The builders of the Empire State building faced many challenges by attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there.The first problem, presented in paragraph nine, was that they hadn't originally designed the building to hold a one thousand foot dirigible with a single rope."" A thousand - foot dirigible moored at the top of the building.... Would add stress to the buildings frame."" @CAPS1 had to reinforce the building to handle this new stress.The second problem, introduced in paragraph thirteen, was that the dirigibles are made out of a dangerous element, ""Hydrogen is very flammable."" The Empire State building builders did not want to take their chances over such a populated area.In paragraph fourteen, the reader learns that wind speed at the top of the building far surpassed wind speed in other places that dirigibles could be docked. This was a problem because when they normally tied down the back end of the dirigible with a rope & led, they could no longer do because of the location that they desire to dock it. The builders of the empire state building atempted to fight architectural flaws, dirigibles safety flaws, and the flaws of nature allow dirigibles to dock there which ultimately didn't work out..The pull and the push of it all..Why can't you see   The way that it must be   You think you're so strong   You know that you are wrong..I don't wanna make a move with the faith!.[Rose:] ""All right, we all turn to page 438..I'm still alive but I'm barely breathing   Just prayin' to a god that I don't believe in   'Cause I got time while she got freedom   'Cause when a heart breaks no it don't break even      Her best days will be some of my worst   She finally met a man that's gonna put her first   While I'm wide awake she's no trouble sleeping   'Cause when a heart breaks no it don't break even, even, no      What am I supposed to do when the best part of me was always you,   And what am I supposed to say when I'm all choked up and you're OK   I'm falling to pieces, yeah,   I'm falling to pieces      They say bad things happen for a reason   But no wise words gonna stop the bleeding   'Cause she's moved on while I'm still grieving   And when a heart breaks no it don't breakeven even, no      What am I gonna to do when the best part of me was always you,   And what am I supposed to say when I'm all choked up and you're OK   I'm falling to pieces, yeah,   I'm falling to pieces, yeah,   I'm falling to pieces   (One still in love while the other ones leaving)   I'm falling to pieces   ('Cause when a heart breaks no it don't breakeven)      Oh you got his heart and my heart and none of the pain   You took your suitcase, I took the blame   Now I'm try'na make sense of what little remains ooh   'Cause you left me with no love and no love to my name      I'm still alive but I'm barely breathing   Just prayed to a god that I don't believe in   'Cause I got time while she got freedom   'Cause when a heart breaks no it don't break   No it don't break   No it don't breakeven no      What am I gonna do when the best part of me was always you and   What am I suppose to say when I'm all choked up and you're OK   (Oh glad your okay now)   I'm falling to pieces yeah   I'm falling to pieces yeah   I'm falling to pieces   (One still in love while the other ones leaving)   I'm falling to pieces yeah   ('Cause when a heart breaks no it don't breakeven)      Oh it don't breakeven no   Oh it don't breakeven no   Oh it don't breakeven no.We both lie silently still   In the dead of the night   Although we both lie close together   We feel miles apart inside      Was it something I said or something I did   Did my words not come out right   Though I tried not to hurt you   Though I tried   But I guess that's why they say      Chorus:   Every rose has it's thorn   Just like every night has it's dawn   Just like every cowboy sings his sad, sad song   Every rose has it's thorn   Yeah it does      I listen to our favorite song   Playing on the radio   Hear the dj say loves a game   Of easy come and easy go   But I wonder does he know   Has he ever felt like this   And I know you'd be here right now   If I could have let you know somehow   I guess      Chorus      Though it's been a while now   I can still feel so much pain   Like a knife that cuts you the wound heals   But the scar, that scar remains      I know I could have saved our love that night   If I'd known what to say   Instead of makin' love   We both made our separate ways   But now I hear you found somebody new   And that I never meant that much to you   To hear that tears me up inside   And to see you cuts me like a knife   I guess      Chorus.There was Christ in the metal shell   There was blood on the pavement   The camera will make you god   That's how jack became sainted      If you die when there's no one watching   Then your ratings drop and your forgotten   But But if they kill you on their T.V..Butterfly, flutter by, butterfly by..You need Aspirin?"
"The main problem of dirigibles landing by the Empire State Building was saftey. For one reason dirigibles were huge; ""Some were as long as one thousand feet, the same length as four blocks in New York City."" The Empire State building is @NUM1 ft tall. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" If a dirigible was going to land on a very windy day it had the potential of crashing into other buildings which would cut through the dirigibles materials. Also on the tethering to the mooring mast, would... ""weigh down in the back with lead weights..."" the idea was dangerous. To hold the dirigible to the building there would be lead weights, ""dangling high above pedestrians on the street, was neither practical nor safe."" Due to all these problems the dirigible would never be safe to land on the mooring mast was the problems that the builders faced..Beauty not rest, give me truth instead..Give it up!.That I've been hesitating so long, so long   Somebody turn up the lights   'Cause right now must be my time to shine      (ALL)   They said I couldn't, they told me that I wouldn't   But if they could see me now   They'd see I'm something, that I'm not scared of nothing   And the world will hear me shout   We say oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh   Might call me crazy but I've been thinking, maybe   You would change your mind if you could see me now      Oh-whoa-oh-oh-oh   Oh-whoa-oh-oh-oh   Oh-whoa-oh-oh-oh      (LEIGH-ANNE)   Drop me in the ocean, I'll swim   Throw me in with the lions, I'll roar   There's a survivor within   So much stronger than I was before      (PERRIE)   They never saw me coming, so what, so what?.Wonder if it seems so hard to be, and things would hurt you   I am forever, I am forever   We are forever, we are forever      I am your friend, through thick and thin   We need each other, we'll never part, our love is from the heart   We never say I don't need you, We are forever   I am the one who said that you are free   Wonder if it seems so hard to be (the only one), and nothing would cheer you   I am forever, wasn't it I who carried you around?.I don't know why it is that I wanna stay,   I don't know what it is that makes me feel this way,   But I'm not gonna do what I hear me say,   I'm just gonna walk,   I'm gonna walk away..Spook city U.

"There were many reasons that the mooring mast couldn't be used. The first reason is wind speeds. In fact ""in 1930, the @ORGANIZATION1 dirigible, Los Angeles, approached the mooring mast but could not get close enough to tie because of forceful winds."" @CAPS1 the dirigibles could not even get close enough to dock. Another reason was safety. In 1937 the German dirigible, Hindenburg, went down because of a fire. That situation could've been a lot worse if they dirigible went down on heavily populated areas, in which thousands of people might die. The last reason is that there is a law prohibiting airships flying too low over urban are urban areas. Therefore it would be illegal for a dirigible to get close enough to dock..Will you be my big plaything..See, I didn't want to gank you   but don't make me bank you, thank you   Tried to get yo the hood, and you might guess   that a fool like me woulda shot Cyrus   Incognito, Ghetto Eagle   Saying, ""Fuck, where did he go?"".I would   I take a look around   It's evident the scene has changed   And there are times when I feel improved upon the past   Then there are times when I can't seem to understand at all   And yes it seems as though I'm going nowhere   Really fucking fast.Quarter to three..Hmmm, I guess but baby you should know oh, oh, oh, oh      I'm an optimist   I'm so positive   That you'll never get another chance with me baby   I'm an optimist   I'm so positive   That your chances blown, boy you're gone, spread your negativity..Hush, can you feel the breeze of another day?.Other girls look at me   But you are the only one I see   I fantasize, day and night,   Going crazy, can't get you out of my mind   Are you ready (ready) for romance   Come on girl, I gotta take a chance      Let me be (your little) loverboy   You can be (my little) lovergirl   We can be (like little) lovebirds      A touch of your hand can make this mind a joy a loverboy oh man [?].I don't think so   Six foot tall   Came without a warning, so I had to shoot him dead   He won't come around here anymore   Come around here?.Went down last night to take a look around   Met little Sadie and I blew her down, went right home, went to bed   Forty-four colt smokes under my head   And I began to think what a deed I'd done   Grabbed my hat and away I run, made a good run, but a little too slow   They overtook me in Jericho   I'm standin' on the corner ringin' the bell   Along came the sheriff from Thomasville   Says ""Young man, your name's Brown,   Remember the night you blew Sadie down?"""
" The obsticals that the @CAPS1 had with docking the Dirigibles were that even though they would be tied up in the front. The back end would still swivel in the wind. They couldn't put little waits on the back because if they ever fell they would @CAPS2 podestriens. And there was a law past ships couldnt dock on Building or even come close to rural areas.

"The architects of the mooring mast were blind to the amount of problems that could have arisen. Balloons are not very strong and if they didn't already know, it's windy on the top of the empire state building. The wind Could drive the drigible right into its spikey doom. They had no real way of keeping the drigible contained because usually lead blocks held it down. From 102 stories in the air, that wasn't the safest plan. Also, most non-@CAPS1 dirigibles used hydrogen instead of helium. In a crowded New York City, a fireball like that would be devastating due to hydrogen being highly flammable.

"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" there were some obsticales that the builders faced. Some of the obsticales that were faced had to do with the strength of the frame. The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast to top the the buildings flat roof because it would stress the frame to much. So over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had been made to the buildings frame work. Anothe obsticae the mooring mast was never destined to fulfill its purpose..Down at the market you can hear,   All the ladies cry out while on their heads they bear,   Akie rice, salt fish are nice,   And the sun is fine any time of the year..Dementia, you're driving me crazy      This is driving me crazy   Dementia, Dementia, Dementia   Every light in the night flickered in and out   Every bone in my back shivered up and down   Keep the pace in case all the magic dies   'Cause this is driving me crazy   Every voice from my head shouted yes and no   Every freight train that fought fought to stop and go   Keep the pace in case all the magic dies   'Cause this is driving me crazy   Be surprised I'm a ghost keeping out of sight      Open up your eyes you're a star in the summer night   This is love this is war, it's insanity   Dementia you're driving me crazy!.Oh, let me hold you just once   Honey I'll ask you just once more   Because it's got to be such a long, long way from cryin'   And I been cryin'   And I got tears in my eyes   But don't you know when you love somebody, have some pressures   There can never, never, never be any secret,   No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no..Who snaps it asunder   The very next night   Some say the rider   Some say the mare   Or that love's like the smoke   Beyond all repair      But my darling says   ""Leonard, just let it go by   That old silhouette   On the great western sky""   So I pick out a tune   And they move right along   And they're gone like the smoke   And they're gone like this song.Inside let me go   Hey Geoff, we need photos   Before the show!.You gonna have a laugh, yeah, you've gotta give it   A little bit of this, a little bit of that   Look out for PC Plodger   If a job's worth doin', it's worth doin' well   And they call me the Artful Dodger   (Get on your bike)   I said, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah   If you can't take a joke well, sod ya   (Oh)   I'm a bit of a lad and they call me the Artful Dodger   (Now)   A little bit of this, a little bit of that   Hoist up the Jolly Roger   That's the way to do it, call me the Artful Dodger   And I'm doin' all right   Yes, I'm doin' all right   Yes, I'm doin' all right   Yes I'm doing very well, thank you   How ya doin'?.Float to me on your illusion..Uh huh.

"The architects building the Empire State Building incountered a big problem when trying to put the mooring mast on the very top.

"In The ""Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION1 many problems with the mast of the Empire State building are explained. One of the many problems was that the large deregible tied to the building mast would add stress to the building which could cause the building to collapse. But this problem was fixed by strengthening the building's foundation. A second problem with docking a dirigible at the Empire State building was the highly flammable gases the dirigible used to become lighter than air. If the dirigible were to catch fire its metal frame could fall to the ground endangering citizens below. The last danger would be that while the dirigible was docked strong air currents coming off of the building could cause the dirigible's tail to spin around on the mast. One way to fix this would be to Place lead weights on the back of the ship. But if one of these weights fell off of the dirigible it could potentially harm pedestrians below. Because of these problems the mast could never be used..Hands up if you're down to get down tonight   'Cause it's always a good time      Slept in all my clothes like I didn't care   Hopped into a cab, take me anywhere   I'm in if you're down to get down tonight   'Cause it's always a good time      Good morning and good night   I'll wake up at twilight   It's gonna be alright   We don't even have to try   It's always a good time (Whooo)      Whoa-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh   It's always a good time   Whoa-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh   We don't even have to try, it's always a good time..I can see the writing on the wall,   I can't ignore this war,   At the end of it all,   Who am I living for?.Escaping through my window   There's a policeman on the lawn outside my home (x2)   I opened my mouth to scream but my throat was full of foam      So I'm sittin' in this cell   My fortune dwindled to a thimble full of filth (x2)   I may spend the rest of my life in jail but at least it's got a floor!.What you are, and what you're meant to be   Speaks his name, though you were born to me,   Born to me, Cassidy..Why should he care if he is hated in his home,   'Cause he's gotta house in the country,   And a big sports car..Wounded heart I cannot save you from yourself   Though I wanted to be brave it never helped   'Cause your trouble's like a flood ragin' through your veins   No amount of love's enough to end the pain   Tenderness and time can heal a right gone wrong   But the anger that you feel goes on and on   And it's not enough to know that I love you still   So I'll take my heart and go for I've had my fill   If you listen you can hear the angel's wings   Up above our heads so near they are hovering   Waiting to reach out for love when it falls apart   When it cannot rise above a wounded heart   When it cannot rise above a wounded heart.I got 20 more minutes to go..I'm here, I'm there, I'm everywhere..You Better Hide!"
" The builders faced many problems that should have been foreseen. Perhaps the greatest reason was because @CAPS1 dirigibles used hydrogen instead of helium as their gas choice. Because hydrogen is highly flammable it would have spelled doom for New York if exploded. The weather also created a great risk. If a dirigible dock there the violent air currents would shifted constantly. The use of lead weights would put pedestrians at risk. That idea was neither safe or practical. Probably one of the most obvious risks was the law. There was a law that stated that airships can fly to low over urban areas. Because of these reasons it made making the Empire State Building a landing area unsafe..I wanna feel your love,   I wanna lay right down..And when you're lying all alone   Do you think of me?.How does love fade away?.Who had Kanye saying ""She a problem""?.Like holy water   Doesn't it taste like holy water?.But I will raise a shelter to the sky   And here beneath this star tonight I'll lie   She will slowly yield the light   As I awaken from the longest night..Excess ain't rebellion..Said ""Hurry, Hurry because the gal you love is dead""   Well I packed up my suitcase   I took off down the road   When I got there she was layin' on the cooling board   I packed up my suitcase   And I took off down the road   When I got there she was layin' on the cooling board      It looked like ten thousand people standing around the burial ground   I didn't know I loved her 'till they began to let her down   Looked like ten thousand people standing on the burial ground   I didn't know that I loved her 'till they began to let her down      You know it's so hard to love   Someone that don't love you   Won't get satisfaction   Don't care what you do   So hard to love   Someone that don't love you      Don't look like satisfaction   Don't care what you do      Well I got up this morning   The break of day   Just hugging the pillows   She used to lay      Got up this morning   The break of day   Just hugging the pillows   Where my baby used to lay.Valerie please believe   It never could work out   The time to make plans   Has passed, faded away   Oh the way you look   Makes my starry eyes shiver   Then I look away   Too much for one day   One thing we share   Is an ideal of beauty      Treasure so rare   That even devils might care   Your swimming-pool eyes   In sea breezes they flutter   The coconut tears   Heavy-lidded they shed   Swaying palms at your feet   You're the pride of your street   While you worship the sun   Summer lover of fun   Gold number with neighbours   Who said that you'll go far   Maybe someday be a star   A fast mover like you   And your dreams will all come true      All of my hope, and my inspiration   I drew from you   Our life's pattern's drawn in sand   But the winds could not erase   The memory of your face   Deep in the night   Plying very strange cargo   Our soul-ships pass by   Solo trips to the stars, in the sky   Gliding so far   That the eye cannot follow   Where do they go   We'll never know"
"In the excerpt, ""The Mooring Mast"", by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, the builders of the Empire State building faced a few problems in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. one of the first problems they faced was safety. ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable"" (Lüsted, @NUM1). The builders would have to keep this in mind. The next obstacle they faced was nature and its winds. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to the violent air currents,"" (@NUM2). The winds would be a major problem that the builders would have to face because it is so unpredictable. Lastly, the builders had to worry about the law pertaining to airships flying too low over urban areas ""This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area,"" (@NUM3). The builders of the Empire State Building had to face the difficulties of safety, nature, and the law in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building..That shadow behind me, don't even look like me..Hello?.I and I   In creation where one's nature neither honors nor forgives   I and I   One say to the other, no man sees my face and lives..You've got no sense of your own identity..""I admit you puberty was somewhat strange   Could this be fixed with Mary Jane?.Didn't I see you down in San Antone   On a hot and dusty night?.I wanna care   I wanna wonder where they are   I wanna see that they go farther than me   And carry on, the things I love, when I'm gone..Keep your eyes on the road,   Keep your hands upon the wheel..What's your thing, am I still your guy?"
"Some of the problems with the constructing of docking dirigibles were that, natural causes like high winds said in ¶ 6.
