The faced of the Empire State Building challenges many builders with docking airships one of the most obveouse reasons was the danger of docking at such high altitudes. The most would be manoverability import reason. The banned even aircraft @ORGANIZATION2 law of any type flying so low.
"The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there is that had to make they the Empire State Building taller.

The builders of the Empire State Building faced many problems prevented dirigibles that from landing there. The first was that a dirigible would add to the mast of the building ""stress moored to the building's frame"". Another reason that dirigibles could not be attached to the Empire State building is that dirigibles are highly flammable when use hydrogen gas they. It became apparent that if a were to catch dirigible fire in downtown New York it would be too terrible to risk. Dirigibles also couldn't be attached to the mast because the would cause on top of the building back the winds of the ship to ""swivel around and around the mooring mast"" and this would not be safe. Finally, dirigibles could not be moored to the Empire State building because ""the sharp puncture of other buildings in the area [could] shell the dirigible's spires"". Dirigibles could not land at the Empire State Building because were dangers too many there."

"The was never of using a mooring mast in order to allow dirigibles to dock at the top of the Empire State Building one a practical idea.

"Although were hopes great there for the attempt to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building, many obstacles hopes faced while trying to reach this dream.

"well, since this one was in their expanded use in New York City lack the obstacle of landing area For the dirigibles. So, decided to add Al Smith a mooring mast on top of the Empire State building to allow these dirigibles to anchor there to get gas for several hours and also service. But, then yet the electric would cause stress winch cable to the building frame."
 In building the mast and docking to the empire state building the faced problems major constructers. The was of a dock for dirigibles idea a good Idea at the time but faced both structrial and social problems. Architects and stated that over time the would cause for the dirigible and climatic change strain dock on the framework of the building. Another was the builders faced location the problem of the building itself. Newly built had hydrogen dirigibles rather than helium which led to flamibility.

"The Empire faced hardships State building while trying to dock their dirigibles. The tried to build builders a docking station for the dirigibles, but the only problem they had was safely docking in thousands of feet in the air. The one was to their expanded use in New York City lack the obstacle of a suitable landing area. Another was why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building laws the reason about airships flying too low over urban areas."
"The encountered of the Empire State Building obstacles builders in trying to allow dirigibles to dock at the mooring mast on top of the building. The main problem was perhaps that foreign don't use helium dirigibles, they use hydrogen. The main problem was perhaps that foreign dirigibles don't hydrogen helium, use hydrogen they. was hydrogen problem a huge Using because hydrogen is extremely flammable. If a problem did occur, hypothetically, that a dirigible caught fire would cause threat a it to New York Cwould causey which is highly populated. If the blew people up the dirigible of New York would not have enough time to get away from the blast. Another was winds problem. blow can easily dirigible the Winds off its course of worse into a spire on top of a building and puncture it. This problem was discovered when the U.S navy Was attempting ""Los Angeles"" to reach dirigible the mooring mast. These obstacles and dangers suggest the is idea a bad mooring mast."

"The wanted to allow Empire State Building dirigibles to dock on top. The first problem, of many, was that plop could not just mast a they on the top because it would be to unstable and cause to much stress to the structure. To prevent that what ended doing up they was modifying and strengthening the structure as a whole costing over sixty thousand dollars. Once figured to equal out how they out all of the wind pressure, figured had to think of how to bring the dirigibles in, the answer was simple electrical winches.

The next problem was safty, used outside of the @LOCATION1 hydrogen highly flammable dirigibles and if that blew up it would not be good for the densely populated city below. Another was winds nature's violently shifting safety issue and to solve the problem on the ground they would waive the back down with lead weights to keep it from sweying, but doing that in the air over a lot of people could be unsafe.

"used from outside the United States hydrogen Dirigibles, not helium. Hydrogen to happen more flammable, causing the builders to realize if an accident like when the German dirigible to happen destroyed by a fire in New Jersey was would be more worse if was to happen it in a populated area such as downtown New York.

"In their attempts to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building, the faced obstacles many builders. These made docking winds a dirigible nearly impossible, because ""the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" Another were faced safety issues obstacle builders. After a dirigible fire in New Jersey, realized dangers the builders of dirigibles and what would happen if a dirigible caught on fire above New York City. Finally, faced also laws the builders regarding air traffic. The prevented airships laws from flying ""too low over urban areas."" in the end, the prevented builders obstacles from letting dirigibles dock on the Empire State Building."

"While the were designing mast the architects, they realized that the building was not built to withstand the stress of dirigibles and the wind.

"would like to jump Everyone in a dirigible and transport from one location to the next. Although, are challenges many there the builders faced in attempt to doing so. included of these challenges amount the One of stress the single cable tether from the dirigible would add to the building.

Another obstacle but the builders faced law that was law an existing there against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law would make it illegal for airships if try ever to approach they the area.

"For one reason dirigibles length huge; ""were length as long as one thousand feet, the same Some as four blocks in New York City."" The Empire is @NUM1 State building ft tall.

To hold the dirigible to the building would be weights lead there, ""dangling high above pedestrians on the street, was neither practical nor safe."""
"were reasons many There that the mooring mast couldn't be used. The first is wind speeds reason. In fact ""in 1930, the @ORGANIZATION1 approached, Los Angeles, mooring mast the dirigible but could not get close enough to tie because of forceful winds."" Another was safety reason. The last reason law that is law a there prohibiting airships flying too low over urban are urban areas."

"The Could drive right the drigible wind into its spikey doom. had way no real They of keeping the drigible contained because usually lead blocks held it down. From 102 stories in the air, wasn't plan the safest that. Also, most non-@CAPS1 used hydrogen dirigibles instead of helium. Also, most non-@CAPS1 used helium hydrogen instead of dirigibles. The should have planned really this builders out better."
"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" were obsticales some there that the builders faced. had of the obsticales that were faced to do Some with the strength of the frame.

"The incountered building the Empire State Building problem a big architects when trying to put the mooring mast on the very top. The second would add in paragraph @CAPS1 states, ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building held by single cable tether, stress sentence to the buildings frame."" Although the faced problems many architects this was the biggest. Although the architects faced many problems was biggest the this. This ment that would have to change they the buildings structure in order to make it work. It says in the bottom of paragraph @CAPS1 that over sixty thousand had worth of modifications to be made dollars."
One of the many problems was that the large would add tied to the building mast stress deregible to the building which could cause the building to collapse. A second was with docking a dirigible at the Empire State building gases the highly flammable problem the dirigible used to become lighter than air. A second problem with docking a used at the Empire State building was the highly flammable gases the used to become dirigible lighter than air. If the were to catch dirigible fire its metal frame could fall to the ground endangering citizens below. One would be to fix this lead to Place way weights on the back of the ship. But if one of these weights fell off of the dirigible harm could potentially pedestrians it below.
 The faced problems many builders that should have been foreseen. Perhaps the greatest reason was because @CAPS1 used hydrogen dirigibles instead of helium as their gas choice. Perhaps the greatest reason was because @CAPS1 used helium hydrogen instead of dirigibles as their gas choice. Because hydrogen is highly flammable would have spelled doom it for New York if exploded. The created also risk a great weather. The would put of lead weights pedestrians use at risk. Probably was of the most obvious risks law the one. was law a There that stated that airships can fly to low over urban areas. Because of these reasons made making it the Empire State Building a landing area unsafe.

The had of the Empire State Building to face builders the difficulties of safety, nature, and the law in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building."
"Also another important factor was that this was being taken place project in a highly populated area, which meant harm could be done civilians if anything ever went wrong.
