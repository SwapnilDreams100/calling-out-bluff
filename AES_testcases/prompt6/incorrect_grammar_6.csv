"a builders on a empire state building were challenged a obstacle on construction, safety, & nature that did not allow dirigible 2 dock is. ase dirigible or blimps were large balloons that were capable on carrying passengers but needed an great l&ing isa. in order from dirigible 2 be used as transportation, architects needed 2 deign an suitable mooring mast. however, a weight & presure on an blimp on an mast will cause an large amount on stres 2 a buildings frame. a builders on a empire state building were faced with producing ""over sixty thous& dollars  worth on modifications"" 2 a buildings framework. not only should attempting blimps 2 dock is an lot on work & very costly, builders were challenge with safety insue. as experienced 2 a german blimp ""hindenburg,"" dirigible that use hydrogen is ""highly flammable."" if any incident occurred over a empire state building in new york, involving an dirigible, it will affect a enormous population in a isan by killing so many live. flying too low over a city should anoar challenge 2 safety that an law will make illegal & unsuccesful from blimps 2 be used. lastly, nature should an obstacle a builders faced in docking dirigible. at mast time, a ""fromceful winds"" will cause a back on a ship swivel which could lead 2 it hitting a sharp spire & be punctured. lead weights were also not safe when dangling over pedetrians. ase obstacle made it difficult 2 create gear that will allow dirigible 2 dock on a building.",4
"a idean on using an mooring mast in order 2 allow dirigible 2 dock at a top on a empire state building should never an practical one. that in due 2 a many struggle that were faced when al smiths team should attempting 2 create an mooring mast that will serve a purpose on docking dirigible. such obstacle included; a presure an docked dirigible will had on a building itself, a hazards on high winds causing a dirigible 2 be shaken violently, a chance on a dirigible catching on fire due 2 a flamibility on a hydrogen if in it, & a close proximity a dirigible will had 2 oar buildings in a isan a first problem faced during a development on a mooring mast should a stres on a heavyweight on a dirigible will put on a building. ""a steel frame on a [building] will had 2 be modified & strenganed 2 accommodate [a added presure from a dirigible]."" a dirigible weight should not a only thing that put stres on a building, a wind presure will also. a wind made it difficult from creating an mooring masts structure because it will not only add presure 2 a building because a dirrigible itself 2 not be able 2 stay in one place ""even if a dirrigible were teisd 2 a mooring mast, a back on a ship will swivel around & around a mooring mast."" an accident that could occur will be an fire due 2 possible flamibility. & since a dirrigible in so close 2 people, such as tourint on a buildings observation deck, a dirrigible catching on fire (if its filled with hydrogen instead on helium) could be more dinastrous than if it l&ed in an open field. lastly,  a dirigiblein so close 2 urban isas that it in illegal from such airships 2 dock or even fly at such proximity.  from example, when a los angele teted  a docking proces 2 a mooring mast on a empire state building it ""could not get close enough 2 tie up because on fromceful winds."" all on ase were major obstacle 2 a building proces on a empire state building & its mooring mast from docking dirigible. ase is also a reasons why a architects on a empire state building came 2 a conclusion that such an structure will not be practical 2 construct.",4
"although is were great hope from a attempt 2 allow dirigible 2 dock on a empire state building, many obstacle were faced while trying 2 reach that dream. one obstacle noticed while deigning a mast 2 dock on, should that a height & weight on an dirigible will greatly add stres 2 a buildings frame. that will an be transmitted 2 a buildings foundation as well. that clearly possesed an problem bigger than a empire state building could withst&. anoar reason that builders faced an obstruction in a hope on allowing dirigible 2 dock should safety reasons. one on a most appisnt problems, should that most dirigible outside on a @location2 were fueled by hydrogen gas, opposed 2 helium gas. that posed an threat, from hydrogen in highly flammable. putting an densely populated isan such as downtown new york at rink consequently came as an obstacle from builders. a nature itself came as one on a last problems from such an dream. winds that were constantly shifting due 2 extreme air currents, at a top on a building could easily cause a back on a dirigible 2 spin around a mooring mast. again putting thous&s on people below a building, should neiar practical nor safe."" as quoted by a passage, ""a mooring mast on a empire state building should never detined 2 fulfill its purpose..."", clearly posing many obstacle in allowing 2 dock dirigible on such an building.",4
"in a proces on building a dock from dirigible, builders faced some obstacle. a first obstacle builders faced, should a lack on suitable l&ing isa. if is shouldn t isan 2 l&, is should no reason or way 2 build it. also, a builders will had 2 remodel a whole building. after a building should framed 2 a 85th floor, ay couldn t build a mast until a roon should done, so it took even longer.a greatet obstacle a mast dealt with should nature itself, because a winds on a tops on a buildings were constantly shifting, so is should no way from an dirigible 2 l& or stay in place without crashing. a final obstacle builders faced should an law against airships flying too low 2 a urban isas, which made it illegal from an ship 2 ever tie up or even approach a building.as u can see, is were many obstacle, & a mast shouldn t useful. it should an great idea. but in my opinion it should an shouldte on time & money.",4
"in, a mooring mast, by @organization2, is were many obstacle a builders on a empire state building faced in attempting 2 allow dirigible 2 dock is. one problem should that a architects could not drop a mooring mast on top on a empire state buildings flat roon. an thous&-foot dirigible will add stres 2 a buildings frame. that means a still frame will had 2 be modified & strenganed. anoar setback should that most blimps from outside a united state used hydrogen & hydrogen in highly flammable.nature itself should a greatet obstacle. a winds on top on a building were always shifting due 2 a violent air current. if a dirigible were teisd 2 a mooring mast, a back on a ship will swivel around. lead weights were an option, but using ase, where ay will be dangling above pedetrians on a street, should not safe. a oar practical reason why blimps could not more at a empire state building should an law against airships flying too low over urban isas. that law will make it illegal from an ship 2 ever tie up 2 a building.",4
"based on a excerpt, a builders on a empire state building faced obstacle in attempting 2 allow dirigible 2 dock is. one obstacle should lack on suitable l&ing isa; ""so were as long as one thous& feet, a same length as four blocks in new york city."" anoar obstacle should a wieght on an mooring mast. ""a steel frame on a empire state building will had 2 be modified & strenganed,"" which means ay will had 2 modify a whole frame 2 bis a weight on a mooring mast which will cost over sixty thous& dollars.safety should also an insue. most dirigible outside a united state used hydrogen. hydrogen in extremely flammable, so if it caught fire over an highly populated isan such as downtown new york than a accident will be much worse. anoar insue should a fact that ""a winds on top on a building were constantly shifting due 2 violent air currents."" because on a wind a dirigible will swivel around a mooring mast.",3
"a people who were attempting 2 allow dirigible 2 dock at a empire state went through many obstacle. ay will first had 2 modify & strenganed a buildings frame 2 accommodate that new situation. a architects deigned an shiny glass & chrome-nickel stainles steel tower that will be illuminated from inside, with an stepped-back deign that imitated a overall shape on a building itself. after doing all on that work ay an found out that a mast on a empire state building will never work. a greatet reason should saftey. most dirigible from outside on a united state used hydrogen raar than helium, & hydrogen in highly flammable. a bigget obstacle should nature itself. a winds on top on a building were constantly shifting due 2 violent air currents. a oar practical reason why dirigible could not moor at a empire state building should an exinting law against airships flying too low over urban isas. a law made it illegal from an ship 2 ever tie up 2 a building or even approach a isa. by a late 1930s a idean on using a mooring mast from dirigible & air passengers had quietly dinappeisd. dirigible instead on becoming a transportation on a future, had given way 2 airplane.",3
"a builders on a empire state building faced a problem on how 2 keep a back end on a blimp from swaying in a wind. ay were unable 2 solve that problem, as we see in paragraph @num1 where it says: ""even if a derigible were teisd 2 a mooring mast, a back on a ship will swivel around & around a mooring mast."" anoar problem with docking blimps on a empire state building should an law that stopped dirigible from flying too low over populated isas. is in proon on that in paragraph @num2 where it says ""a oar practical reason why dirigible could not moor at a empire state building should an exinting law against airships flying too low over urban isas."" one more problem with mooring dirigible on a empire state should that it should hard from pilots 2 dock air ships on a mooring. an example on that in in paragraph @num2 where it says ""a u.s. navy dirigible los angele approached a mooring mast but could not get close enough 2 tie up because on fromceful winds.""",3
"a architects on a mooring mast were blind 2 a amount on problems that could had arinen. balloons is not very strong & if ay didn t already know, its windy on a top on a empire state building. a wind could drive a drigible right in2 its spikey doom. ay had no real way on keeping a drigible contained because usually lead blocks held it down. from 102 storie in a air, that shouldn t a safet plan. also, most non-@caps1 dirigible used hydrogen instead on helium. in an crowded new york city, an fireball like that will be devastating due 2 hydrogen being highly flammable. a builders really will had planned that out better.",3
"a builders on a empire state building faced obstacle in attempting 2 allow dirigible 2 dock is. a main obstacle should that a builders couldn t @caps1 put a mooring mast on a empire state building, because it had an flat roon. a mooring mast will put presure on a buildings fram. 2 overcome that obstacle a architects had 2 modify & strengan a frame. more than sixty thous& dollars  went in2 a modifications on a framework. a greatet obstacle though should nature, & is should nothing a builders could do about that. a violent air currents caused winds on a top on a building 2 constantly shift. in open fields dirigible could be weighted down in a back using led weights, but with pedetrians around it willn t be practical nor safe. without being weighted down a dirigible will swivel around.",3
"in constructing a empire state building, builders faced multiple obstacle in attempting 2 allow dirigible 2 dock atop a @caps1. one obstacle that constructors faced should modifications, ""a stres on a dirigible load & wind presure will had 2 be transmitted all a way 2 a foundation."" with that obstacale contractors will need 2 reinfromce a @caps1 on a frame & a foundation. & a obstacle as stated from a excerpt in ""most dirigible from outside a united state use hydrogen raar than helium, which in flammable."" @caps2 that hydrogen in flammable it will not be good if an dirigible exploded over a streets on new york. those is a obstacle contractors faced during a construction on a empire state building.",3
"a empire state building should in construction a building passed from many obstacle. first, because ay wanted 2 do a bigget build in a world & ay had 2 work hard. a state building should detined 2 never fulfill its purpose from reason that will had been appisnt befrome it should ever constructed",0
"building an big piece on work in not easy. u had 2 fix a negative & do everything correctly. u never know at time u had 2 tear things down from hard work 2 be completed right. when looking at u did right things 2 prevent bad things from occurring.u may face an whole bunch on things when building. a empire faced attemps one allowed 2 dock when building a dirigible 2 a dock should not perfrommed or built right. even though said, swinging 2 climb on as build presure by.although, building things in hard. u get a beauty & hardship out on it. it helps u reminded on ur wells done correctly.",0
 a empire state building faced in attempting 2 build a highet building in new york because ay wanted 2 be so big & ay had been working on it from so menny years.,0
 a empire state building faced alot promblems befrome it came out as an @organization1.  ay scisd that oar people will detroy that building.  so a reduced a dirigible 2 dock is. ay wanted air city 2 become an famous city & get more money. & oar problem a some people didn t cis & postpone 2 later.,0
 based on a excerpt a obstacle that a builders faced. should that ay had 2 go 2 a base on a building 2 make it taller. that in a obstacle that ay faced.,0
